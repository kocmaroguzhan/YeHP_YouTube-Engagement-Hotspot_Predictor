start_time,end_time,words
0,20,I 'm about to enter one of the world 's strangest places a country that does n't exist honestly you could probably find bodies you could probably find ammunition this is transnistria and you 've never heard of it before because it can not be found on any map transnistria has its own government currency passport and even their own military on the surface it might seem like any
20,40,other country but inside these mysterious borders citizens wave flags from their communist paths and strict military checkpoints can be found all over so what is it really like to live in a country that the rest of the world thinks is fake and who exactly are the people who call this place home come with me as I explore transnistria where less than 500 tourist
40,60,visit a year getting to transnistria is n't so easy first we have to fly to mdova Europe 's poorest and least visited country so I 'm traveling with my wife Deana and her mom Sheila and her mom does not know where we 're going we 're literally at the airport are you excited yeah where are we going I
60,80,just sow and she 's the kind of type that just goes with the flow and I know she 's going to have a good time but she literally does n't know where we 're about to board the flight to where do you think we 're going as soon as we arrive I start to take in the unusual Vibe of the capital
80,100,city It 's a beautiful morning in Kish now mova I 'm heading out to meet my guide Tim who 's actually an american guy that 's been living in transnistria for 17 years and together we 're going to be heading in to learn all about this Place traveling from mdova into transnistria is no joke this is n't your typical border crossing
100,120,one wrong move and things could get messy checkpoint checkpoint can I shoot now of course but just like that we 're in and I 'm starting to notice small differences between this land and where we just came from it 's just fun to look out the window here you just see that you do n't usually see infrastructure from the Soviet unions there they did n't do anything with it and if somebody 's not taking care of it it 's collapsing
120,140,driving on these roads feels like taking a time machine back to the Soviet Union before it dissolved into the modern Russia we know today here the shadow of war never fully faded especially underground here we have a whole network of caves that goes on for 130 km just non - stop it 's not even mapped by the way we 've had cavers come here from
140,160,Australia they got lost 130 km that 's like 60 70 miles or something yeah you can see uh the old marks on the walls this is from the mining blocks that built the city of Odessa there 's such this network it 's built so deep underground that during World War II it was great bunkers and then again with the civil war with malova
160,180,between pinova and uh malova it was also used for bunkers how deep have you been to this we do n't go too deep because you get back too far it 's it 's pitch black honestly you could probably find bodies you could probably find ammunition you could probably find there might be an old tank back there 100 km back who knows it 's so bizarre to see things like this
180,200,here like just existing and there 's nobody around it honestly makes me want to walk through it and see how far I can go so this one has a star this was carved by uh Soviet soldiers in World War II and this is the Soviet star that 's not the original paint there 's some bikers from terespol that come out here and paint it every year but inside this particular cave we brought you here
200,220,because the names of the World War II soldiers are carved on the wall along with the date there 's a good hangout spot for kids there 's seashells this um actually had million million years and it 's holy crap part of s sea yeah me back for sure there were lights it 's cold in here
220,240,these old rusted things these carried uh electricity uh uh Communications cables even water going all the way back so the soldiers who were uh carrying ammunition and had jeeps and tanks had electricity Communications this is so freaky man we 've only stepped just
240,260,inside was there a lot of like combat here in World War II Oh yeah this is the front lines of what they called the kitchen Al Yash offensive and it was the biggest battle after Stalingrad but oh c but in in Western schools you do n't really learn about no not at all before we explore any further let 's get our facts straight what is transnistria and why is it
260,280,considered a fake country during World War II the area became a Battleground under Nazi occupation where thousands of Jews and Romani people were killed in concentration camps then when the Soviet Union collapse in 1991 mdova became its own independent country but transnistria home to many Russian speakers wanted no part of it they declared independence although no one not even
280,300,Russia recognizes them as a Sovereign Nation about a year later things escalated into a brutal war between mova and transnistrian forces backed by Russian troops the conflict ended with a ceasefire but Russian soldiers have remained here ever since we 've made it somewhere on the outskirts of taspo to a guy 's house actually Tim 's friend he 's got a collection of weapons we 've
300,320,been told dude these buildings to me are so bizarre it looks like they just stick it with like gum in the middle yeah whatever material that is throw it together and like
320,340,there it is very cool sounds very very communist hearing this old record play communist song from Soviet times send shivers down my spine but nothing compares to the guns he 's about to show
340,360,right yeah he found this in kid can this Village a monaster yeah you found it there does n't work no it 's not illegal if be work wow good yeah so you can instead
360,380,of multiple ways to die please do n't do that do you put close to your body when you shoot cuz the you want to put it on your shoulder under my shoulder no no like him ah okay yeah so your shoulder takes the uh Reverb of a
380,400,okay it 's pretty heavy it 's like 20 l oh do you think people die with that sword yeah yes I 'm sure they did it would n't take much to die with you look cute with that helmet on there 's a schwas inside of it oh let really
400,420,this is actually an mg34 machine gun from the Germans in World War II it 's heavy well Arnold Schwarzenegger and Predator would this dude that 's crazy so trania and so is Bulgaria 17 16 yeah oh wow that 's a
420,440,beautiful hand yeah this is over 100 years old and we have old Soviet uniforms too socialist oslavia 17 18 years what is this one oh captain of Yugoslavia could actually be a fashion yeah it really could I swear this room packed with all these
440,460,Collectibles holds so much value I 've never seen anything like it before in my life our journey continues to explore some monuments in this unrecognized country online it says there 's like a half a million people on nria but it 's like it 's not true they all left no uh it 's not that they all left the the families are still here but usually at least one person from each family works works outside of trans so
460,480,"what what is the population I would say 300,000 this is a World War II Memorial and what you 'll find interesting about all the villages here is this was the front lines of the kitchen alash offensive and all these names are people who died in World War II from this Village interesting statue cuz he 's holding a pepar machine gun which is the"
480,500,machine gun that was held up over the re tag in Germany at the end of World War II not only is there a World War II monument here but there is a monument to the civil war with malova because there was a missile strike here and this missile unfortunately killed all these kids uh you can see they 're no older than 18 or 19 this is a manager of
500,520,the old Soviet theater and he 's going to take us in cool we got a lot of keys
520,540,there okay whoa this is cool man welcome to Soviet Union in 1950 we just entered into a Soviet theater that 's literally been untouched for decades and this is exactly how it was during Soviet times you can even see
540,560,the smell in here smells like the Soviet Union the speakers the chairs the ceilings in here is an old film movie room where nothing has changed since 1940 W so yeah you can see it 's inside they have these poster of sun movies all machines they have the old real movies here from
560,580,the Soviet Union exactly nothing 's changed it 's all here in good condition yeah should be in a museum these are super valuable to someone very rarely have I been to a place that 's completely Frozen in time it 's really the only place left in the world that you really feel like you 're in the Soviet Union when you 're traveling here because all the other former Soviet countries like usbekistan Armenia
580,600,Georgia they 've moved on they 've developed a lot and they 've become a lot more modern and different with new governments and new systems in place but here in transnistria it 's literally like you 're in the Soviet Union as a traveler that 's cool as someone who 's interested in history and how the world works and the influence that the Soviet Union had on the world it 's fascinating so this bank
600,620,here you only have a local card yeah and it 's not on the Swift Code system so you ca n't use it anywhere outside of trans anista so ethnically they 're a mix of movian ukrainians Romanians and Russians if you have the family heritage you are eligible for all these passports oh wow some people I know people who have five passports really yeah
620,640,okay so we 're going to an old Soviet buffet and it 's just as it was in the Soviet Union grandmothers make all the food they put it out in buffet style and you just take what you want want and it 's very cheap and healthy perfect are you hungry cow tasty oh my God see this is all
640,660,local people this is so wild I actually met tourist here they 're from lvia you guys enjoying yeah we are enjoying this because this is actually part of our past we lived this but now we are happy that we are out of this and part of the western world
660,680,thank God going through the buffet here which feels like Russian Grandma serving me food thank you it 's $ 3 a meal including the water now this is a meal we got for soup sour cream chicken cabbage eggplant that up Yummy Yummy in the light bulb here they have the
680,700,mascot from the 1980 Olympics which was in Russia what do you think about the cafe check out how crazy the money Works in transnistria so these are the Bills they 're actually the smallest bills in the world they 're tiny I have small hands there 's denominations of 25 rubles yes they 're called rubles like
700,720,Russian rubles but they 're completely worthless outside of transnistria and then you have these plastic coins literally it 's the only place in the world where you can find plastic coins here 's one Ruble it 's a circle this is three rubles it 's a square so I guess if you 're blind you can feel the edges of it and realize the denomination but yes they are completely
720,740,so freaking weird like much of the region transnistrian people follow Eastern Orthodox Christianity which means Di and her mother have to cover up now that we 're about to visit a church wow these are beautiful churches here incredible this was originally a mosque because the Ottoman Empire controlled this region and a Katarina the great sent her
740,760,Army from Russia to take over this area and they did and now it 's a Russian Orthodox I 've been in so many churches in my life especially all over Eastern Europe this one 's so different the way everything just feels like it 's very raw and natural and you got Jesus lit
760,780,up here in the sunlight and in this box which is from Jerusalem they believe that this is the original cross that Jesus died on and something you 'll notice that tells you about how open and free the culture is here if this was a gothic church in Germany there would be security everywhere and this would be in a box with cameras on it there 's no security
780,800,yeah nothing no one 's going to take it either no one 's it 's really rustic and colorful in here cool Manda this is actually the largest Monastery in all of mova considering that internationally we are considered to be in mdova right now it 's so cool and reassuring to just know that life is normal here and beautiful and we see things
800,820,like this it 's really amazing so this is very interesting here in trans anista because this is the largest hammer and sickle left in the entire region this is the entry to the old the Soviet Factory region there was lots of factories that shipped Goods back to Moscow and it 's a what does the symbol mean the symbol of the Workers Party communism
820,840,right hold on is making friends what 's your name what 's your name my name is and Dasha Dasha oh how 's life life is good yes how 's Thea very nice are you finished okay bye - bye Paka you try in class let
840,860,'s try it class means drink yeah it 's a zero alcohol okay M yeah it 's like you can say it 's tea before it becomes tea it 's like fermented tea it tastes like beer but not beer yeah like a MTI
860,880,be MTI fake beer there 's like a lot of young people here I imagine that they would all want to leave it depends if they have an income source from outside of here they live very well it 's a paradise land here it 's a paradise land it 's so cheap if you can find a way to make money yeah I 'm digging it so far it 's just like a normal place it 's so
880,900,peaceful that 's one of the first things people say is how peaceful it is I think from watching the Western news too much they expect some kind of marching in the street with people with the Stalin tattooed on their forehead or something and it 's totally normal calm peaceful yeah it 's totally peaceful which is cool how are you nice to meet you I I like your hair
900,920,class he 's like yeah I know I 'm cool I 'm definitely feeling there 's like this hipster Vibe going on with these kids with the teenagers the teenagers we saw girl with pink hair like chains baggy pants it 's a growing movement but they 're not exactly the same because they 're there 's no drug culture here so it 's just the look here right yeah
920,940,Selena goz on the background de is pointing out all the americanisms here it was a Steve Jobs poster got Selena Gomez that 's about it not much more American things going on giant heads of Lenin are everywhere here and this one 's massive there a big head it 's huge it 's one of the biggest ones in the whole region after the fall of the
940,960,Soviet Union a lot of the places tore down all the linen heads but all of ours are intact it 's just the infrastructure is just like in the Soviet Union but that begs the question who runs transnistria hey guys I just quickly popped into my hotel to tell you about the sponsor of this video headspace if you 've never heard of the app it 's been my favorite way to medit date for The Last

1020,1040,the streets of transnistria we have our own Parliament and we have our own President we have our own police force we have our own Army we have our own border guards but we are Monopoly State there 's a mega Corporation Called Sheriff that anything large they own it you know they 're benevolent they 're not hurting anyone they bring a lot of goods and services here they 're the
1040,1060,largest employer of the place there 's one man that owns Sheriff well it 's more like a conglomerate but um but there 's a guy and no one knows where he is he owns his own Island somewh are there protests are there people like we do n't we do n't like this no they do n't care um they have their opinions but they 're not strict about this they do n't they 're not going to feel insulted if you have a different opinion and
1060,1080,they 're pretty much apathetic unlike Americans yeah here they 're very apathetic about politics because they realize they 're the ones that are in control of their lives not government transnistria is so confusing that I 'm still trying to dig deeper about what Tim just told me what exactly is Sheriff well in simple terms it 's the biggest company in transnistria started in 1993 by two cops and it runs
1080,1100,almost everything supermarkets gas stations a mobile network TV channels and even a soccer team it 's basically a monopoly that has deep ties to the government making it hugely influential for many sheriff is the ultimate symbol of corruption and control shaping nearly every part of life in transnistria see the supermarket here is called Sheriff a
1100,1120,Sheriff yeah oh my godom said we 're in the sheriff grocery store and the way that they all dressed with like the local outfit that looks like Super Mario Brothers just got this ice cold bottle of vodka for .30 cheapest vodka in the world it
1120,1140,'s freezing cold ice woo yeah that 's strong that is strong it 's Vodka it 's not
1140,1160,water we are now rolling up to a barge which is basically a large you guess you do n't really call it a boat it 's a giant piece of Steel with pontoons underneath and and that 's how we 're getting across yeah this dates back to World War II because in the old days they would have built pontoon bridges here and tanks would have crossed it and actually on our River the nter there are old t34 still
1160,1180,on the bottom of the river so most of the border is the river but in this case it 's not and so we can cross here without passports these are the guys who r run the barge so when they 're not busy fish actually I do more fish sometimes we get on here and they 're smashed on
1180,1200,yeah ah this is cool because this uh old tree limb is the steering and breaking mechanism for the barge they carved it themselves that 's so cool yeah the movement 's caused by the inertia of the river that 's steering but he 's steering and breaking with us yeah this gu this guy 's a
1200,1220,legend man yeah we are now into UL we 've barged our in p p across the barge I 'm left thinking in a place like transnistria it 's easy to focus on war Soviet history and guys with big guns but there 's
1220,1240,another side to this story one that often goes unnoticed the vital role of the Babushka in Russian Babushka means grandmother but it can refer to any old lady who is charming and hospitable I ca n't wait to bring Diana and her mom to meet some of these ladies and see how they keep their old traditions
1240,1260,alive how are you thank you for having us here is she making wine this is amazing this is the toilet
1260,1280,situation here in the village here we go wow it 's actually better than I thought it was going to be what do you think about transnistria it 's abundant inal crops how about the people nice I just want to take a minute and appreciate how beautiful this Village is we 're surrounded by grape trees plum trees apple trees corn they 're so rich in
1280,1300,natural resources and food all right we 're going to go hang out with the babushkas or the grandmothers as they say in Russian and get their stories walnuts yeah yeah Tak walnuts okay I 'll take a walnut while I ask you some questions how do
1300,1320,you open it strength time thank you BBA what was it like growing up here when you were younger were there any struggles to living here in Soviet times real communis we live it in the communes but we did n't see like communism
1320,1340,yeah the prices was very low like sausage cost two rubles and 20 CET yeah like free free sausages for everyone it was B time have you ever outside she been all in Moscow and Minsk for all her life
1340,1360,fruits for just for selling she never sorry she never traveled there never so she 's never left transnistria never what do you wish that you have in your life that you do n't have right now I want just health and the god to give me more some sometimes to leave and to help
1360,1380,kids there 's a lot of Wars happening really close to transnistria is it something you think about does it affect your life at all well she talking about like if some you know trainings and he can hear this and of course she worrying about this what do
1380,1400,you think about the us only bad only bad okay what 's the key to living a long happy healthy life cuz you seem to be all of those things all the kids like they coming at me visit me and we working
1400,1420,together and I happy what do you think about Trump and Putin he 's a leader and he 's a strong leader and he help people and protect them about Trump well she can say nothing about because she said like he 's
1420,1440,in the United States and he doing business I mean you 're very beautiful and hardworking and courageous so thank you now I will do makeup also I like your teeth they 're beautiful she wants
1440,1460,both of them to sit on her legs she wo n't let us leave without giving us more things she 's so friendly she 's so so so kind this is the kind of place that you could stay for like days and days and days and she 's just going to take care of you she wants to give a gift another one you
1460,1480,'ll get tons of gifts here in The Villages this is like the hospitality of the region yeah and this is something that 's overlooked by everyone whatever they grow themselves in the village you are welcome to it how is it nice yeah so juicy there are seeds in it us
1480,1500,spoiled Americans growing up never had seeds in grapes we ca n't eat all those look at that thank you thank you before we came here my mom 's first impression I mean thoughts they 're aggressive and they 're but it 's
1500,1520,Japan change to reality oh yeah so she said that the reality it 's the opposite of what she thought remember when we at the airport you do n't know where we 're going she said yeah all right Tim there 's not too many Americans walking this land you 've been here for 17 years
1520,1540,give me the spark notes how did you end up in transnistria after a few years of living in Poland I found out that Maldova had dropped their old Soviet Visa standards and I came here by myself so I started working with tourists and of course all local people said no tourist will come here that 's silly they do n't want to see the Soviet stuff and I told them that 's
1540,1560,"exactly why they will come to be honest this is the most fascinating slice of all of Europe you literally feel like as close as you can get to the actual Soviet Union we are in the Town Center here of teraso the biggest city in transnistria the capital city and home of half the population about 150,000 people live here over here is a trans flag with a Russian flag Russian"
1560,1580,flag 's a little bit higher and the rest are the regional flags of transnistria the provinces and over here are the only three unrecognized countries that recognize this unrecognized country that was a confusing sentence you have stia and abazia there used to be nag noach but sadly that one does n't exist anymore 34 how many years of existence
1580,1600,transnistria has been in I 'm 33 so basically my whole life they found this tank in the river recently since there are not many rules in transnistria I think we should CL it yeah oh man this is so awesome what 's better than walking around traso standing on a tank overlooking teras it 's the first time I 've been in a tank
1600,1620,what do you think it 's so cool how do you feel about transn out oh my God it 's it 's amazing so different not many tourist right no everywhere you go in transnistria you see cars like this it looks like they can be taken out of here and placed straight into a museum and how much would this cost a month average like $ 150 a
1620,1640,month I mean if you rent but like I said most people do n't rent only if they 're a student from outside of tesel most people their family owns property outright not the bank so all these people around us they have cheap housing what do the Bills look like how much you pay every month literally like a regular apartment your bills are going to be like $ 30 a month and that
1640,1660,includes uh internet phone gas and electric and water so $ 30 month a dollar a day for all those things you found a dog can I take a picture what 's your name is Linda Linda what 's up I I 'll step back do n't take a
1660,1680,stick showa he 's telling her to set okay oh my God okay I oh wow wow very disciplined that dog freaks me out of those teeth man yeah wow okay thank you she
1680,1700,five years I so so nice to meet you nice to meet you byebye bye bye very nice people it 's actually quite nice this time of the year because the trees are changing colors fall Autumn has begun in the Parks when I was at home when I went to a park or went for a walk nobody Zombie Land and here look the
1700,1720,kids zooming around you parents the parks and the sidewalks are full every night this is precisely why it 's called Airplane Park you have a World War II playing Just In the Park after meeting some people on the streets of terasol Tim wants to introduce me to one of his friends who collects
1720,1740,old Soviet cameras I 've had a lot of fun getting my photo taken on vintage cameras in places like Afghanistan so I 'm stoked to see what this guy is hiding behind closed doors it 's cooler in there because you notice how thick these walls are they 're made from sod he made everything yeah yeah this is my bedroom bedroom yes this is my
1740,1760,guitar good guitar good English can you tell him that he has the best eyebrows I 've ever seen you have great
1760,1780,eyebrows wa that 's so that 's way nicer than the babushka toilet all right it 's the
1780,1800,time of year for n wow yeah fake rock Biz Platinum did n't cost anything free villes here just goes to show that
1800,1820,anywhere you are in the world when you get out of the cities and when you go into the rural places people are so incredibly friendly and that 's really one of the morals of this story is that people are happy here they live normal lives there 's all kind of crazy messed up politics going on both here and around the region but at the end of the day people are just people they just have the same wants and
1820,1840,needs as me and you and they want to just enjoy their lives and that 's been a really reassuring thing to experience here in transnistria after traveling to every single country in the world and in Europe I actually feel connection with
1840,1860,wow he wants to turn it into a giant Museum the quality will be much better than digital what so big wow why does he have that it the most random thing he
1860,1880,possibly could have pulled out daugh like all the to now goes back in the bag back in the bag oh what 's in the box oh at all this oh my God yeah that 's in a lot of
1880,1900,movies a lot of the old school independent directors they started their careers using this old 8 mm film wow that 's so cool that 's so 1950s projector what I 'm
1900,1920,surprised by is how small it is for 1950s very small wow 100y old projector pooid oh wow that is one of the first Polaroid cameras ever made wow problem with all these old Camas is you ca n't find the
1920,1940,film for them and also the battery you ca n't find the battery somehow he got his hands on an old American photo booth here in trans anista I I have no idea how this happened you 'd be surprised what you can find out here yeah yeah uh he wants to uh come what is the best and the worst part about
1940,1960,living in transnistria yeah he said like it 's a black soil and everything green I mean you can grow everything yeah and uh that 's what he likes yeah is there anything you do n't like about living here we need to change people that 's in government and
1960,1980,will'll be everything perfect we made it to a cool hit part of teraso cafes bars you like it here mhm so cool we were just talking about how chill it is here it 's just like a cool place I do n't know how to explain it everyone 's just hanging out before this trip you do n't know anything what do you think now before I have
1980,2000,the awward and now description now it changed you have a different thought Bish away the award description you come in with one perception of how a placees and then you realize that wow it 's actually like really cool here 's the thing about transnistria it might not be recognized by the world but its story is impossible to ignore from the Soviet
2000,2020,Flags to the war torn bunkers to the Babushka still holding on to their traditions this place truly is a time capsule but despite being trapped in political limbo the people here have found a way to live to remember and to make the most of what they 've got at the end of the day it 's the uniquely Eastern European spirit that defines transnistria so even though only a few hundred people get to visit each year what I 've learned
2020,2040,is that it 's often the most forgotten places that have the most to teach us thanks for watching and I 'll see you in the next
