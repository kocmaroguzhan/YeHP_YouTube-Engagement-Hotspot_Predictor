0.08,1.709,I'm about to enter one of the world's
1.7189999999999999,4.23,strangest places a country that doesn't
4.24,6.19,exist honestly you could probably find
6.2,7.47,bodies you could probably find
7.48,9.91,ammunition this is transnistria and
9.92,11.31,you've never heard of it before because
11.32,13.15,it cannot be found on any map
13.16,15.03,transnistria has its own government
15.04,17.15,currency passport and even their own
17.16,19.39,military on the surface it might seem
19.4,21.349,like any other country but inside these
21.359,23.589,mysterious borders citizens wave flags
23.599,25.429,from their communist paths and strict
25.439,27.269,military checkpoints can be found all
27.279,29.23,over so what is it really like to live
29.24,30.71,in a country that the rest of the world
30.72,32.549,thinks is fake and who exactly are the
32.559,34.43,people who call this place
34.44,36.59,home come with me as I explore
36.6,39.229,transnistria where less than 500 tourist
39.239,41.59,visit a
41.6,44.27,year getting to transnistria isn't so
44.28,46.59,easy first we have to fly to mdova
46.6,48.389,Europe's poorest and least visited
48.399,49.99,country so I'm traveling with my wife
50.0,52.069,Deana and her mom Sheila and her mom
52.079,53.75,does not know where we're going we're
53.76,56.83,literally at the airport are you excited
56.84,60.79,yeah where are we going I just sow
60.8,62.47,and she's the kind of type that just
62.48,63.67,goes with the flow and I know she's
63.68,65.109,going to have a good time but she
65.119,66.429,literally doesn't know where we're about
66.439,67.99,to board the flight to where do you
68.0,69.19,think we're
75.4,77.91,going as soon as we arrive I start to
77.92,79.87,take in the unusual Vibe of the capital
79.88,81.749,city It's a beautiful morning in Kish
81.759,84.149,now mova I'm heading out to meet my
84.159,86.03,guide Tim who's actually an american guy
86.04,87.59,that's been living in transnistria for
87.6,89.51,17 years and together we're going to be
89.52,91.35,heading in to learn all about this
93.84,96.19,Place traveling from mdova into
96.2,98.51,transnistria is no joke this isn't your
98.52,100.59,typical border crossing one wrong move
100.6,102.469,and things could get messy checkpoint
102.479,104.789,checkpoint can I shoot now of course but
104.799,106.709,just like that we're in and I'm starting
106.719,108.469,to notice small differences between this
108.479,110.23,land and where we just came from it's
110.24,111.709,just fun to look out the window here you
111.719,114.469,just see that you don't usually see
114.479,115.789,infrastructure from the Soviet unions
115.799,117.109,there they didn't do anything with it
117.119,118.83,and if somebody's not taking care of it
118.84,121.069,it's collapsing driving on these roads
121.079,122.749,feels like taking a time machine back to
122.759,124.749,the Soviet Union before it dissolved
124.759,126.59,into the modern Russia we know today
126.6,129.27,here the shadow of war never fully faded
129.28,131.47,especially underground here we have a
131.48,133.35,whole network of caves that goes on for
133.36,136.55,130 km just non-stop it's not even
136.56,138.43,mapped by the way we've had cavers come
138.44,142.19,here from Australia they got lost 130 km
142.2,144.39,that's like 60 70 miles or something
144.4,146.55,yeah you can see uh the old marks on the
146.56,149.03,walls this is from the mining blocks
149.04,151.27,that built the city of Odessa there's
151.28,153.309,such this network it's built so deep
153.319,155.15,underground that during World War II it
155.16,157.869,was great bunkers and then again with
157.879,160.75,the civil war with malova between pinova
160.76,162.949,and uh malova it was also used for
162.959,165.869,bunkers how deep have you been to this
165.879,167.71,we don't go too deep because you get
167.72,170.229,back too far it's it's pitch black
170.239,171.91,honestly you could probably find bodies
171.92,173.869,you could probably find ammunition you
173.879,175.47,could probably find there might be an
175.48,177.91,old tank back there 100 km back who
177.92,179.63,knows it's so bizarre to see things like
179.64,181.509,this here like just existing and there's
181.519,183.27,nobody around it honestly makes me want
183.28,184.75,to walk through it and see how far I can
184.76,186.789,go so this one has a star this was
186.799,189.11,carved by uh Soviet soldiers in World
189.12,191.07,War II and this is the Soviet star
191.08,192.75,that's not the original paint there's
192.76,194.71,some bikers from terespol that come out
194.72,197.07,here and paint it every year but inside
197.08,199.55,this particular cave we brought you here
199.56,201.509,because the names of the World War II
201.519,204.149,soldiers are carved on the wall along
204.159,206.509,with the date there's a good hangout
206.519,209.869,spot for kids there's seashells this um
209.879,212.309,actually had million million years and
212.319,217.429,it's holy crap part of s sea yeah me
217.439,219.19,back for sure there were lights it's
219.2,221.03,cold in here these old rusted things
221.04,223.429,these carried uh
223.439,226.869,electricity uh uh Communications cables
226.879,229.63,even water going all the way back so the
229.64,232.229,soldiers who were uh carrying ammunition
232.239,235.19,and had jeeps and tanks had electricity
236.319,238.789,Communications this is so freaky man
238.799,240.63,we've only stepped just inside was there
240.64,242.589,a lot of like combat here in World War
242.599,245.11,II Oh yeah this is the front lines of
245.12,246.71,what they called the kitchen Al Yash
246.72,248.949,offensive and it was the biggest battle
248.959,251.47,after Stalingrad but oh c but in in
251.48,252.789,Western schools you don't really learn
252.799,255.55,about no not at all before we explore
255.56,257.749,any further let's get our facts straight
257.759,259.469,what is transnistria and why is it
259.479,261.39,considered a fake country during World
261.4,263.469,War II the area became a Battleground
263.479,265.629,under Nazi occupation where thousands of
265.639,267.39,Jews and Romani people were killed in
267.4,269.27,concentration camps then when the Soviet
269.28,271.99,Union collapse in 1991 mdova became its
272.0,274.39,own independent country but transnistria
274.4,276.59,home to many Russian speakers wanted no
276.6,278.43,part of it they declared independence
278.44,280.43,although no one not even Russia
280.44,282.469,recognizes them as a Sovereign Nation
282.479,284.55,about a year later things escalated into
284.56,286.23,a brutal war between mova and
286.24,288.35,transnistrian forces backed by Russian
288.36,289.909,troops the conflict ended with a
289.919,291.83,ceasefire but Russian soldiers have
291.84,293.59,remained here ever since we've made it
293.6,295.909,somewhere on the outskirts of taspo to a
295.919,298.029,guy's house actually Tim's friend he's
298.039,300.15,got a collection of weapons we've been
300.16,302.189,told dude these buildings to me are so

444.4,446.11,continues to explore some monuments in
446.12,448.07,this unrecognized country online it says
448.08,449.629,there's like a half a million people on

455.72,457.309,usually at least one person from each
457.319,459.869,family works works outside of trans so
459.879,462.629,what what is the population I would say
463.759,466.71,"300,000 this is a World War II Memorial"
466.72,467.869,and what you'll find interesting about
467.879,469.309,all the villages here is this was the
469.319,470.79,front lines of the kitchen alash
470.8,472.95,offensive and all these names are people
472.96,475.35,who died in World War II from this
475.36,477.43,Village interesting statue cuz he's

479.759,482.11,machine gun that was held up over the re
482.12,483.83,tag in Germany at the end of World War
483.84,485.909,II not only is there a World War II
485.919,488.43,monument here but there is a monument to
488.44,491.11,the civil war with malova because there
491.12,492.589,was a missile strike here and this
492.599,494.909,missile unfortunately killed all these
494.919,497.27,kids uh you can see they're no older
497.28,500.309,than 18 or 19 this is a manager of the
500.319,501.79,old Soviet theater and he's going to
501.8,503.35,take us in
503.36,521.35,cool we got a lot of keys there
521.36,525.389,okay whoa this is cool man welcome to
525.399,527.97,Soviet Union in
530.88,533.47,1950 we just entered into a Soviet
533.48,535.67,theater that's literally been untouched
535.68,537.63,for decades and this is exactly how it
537.64,539.91,was during Soviet times you can even see
539.92,541.949,the smell in here smells like the Soviet
541.959,544.43,Union the speakers the chairs the
544.44,547.069,ceilings in here is an old film movie
547.079,549.15,room where nothing has changed since
549.16,552.829,1940 W so yeah you can see it's inside
552.839,556.55,they have these poster of sun movies all
556.56,559.11,machines they have the old real movies
559.12,561.55,here from the Soviet Union exactly
561.56,563.71,nothing's changed it's all here in good
563.72,565.43,condition yeah should be in a museum
565.44,567.43,these are super valuable to someone very
567.44,569.35,rarely have I been to a place that's
569.36,571.67,completely Frozen in time it's really
571.68,573.59,the only place left in the world that
573.6,574.87,you really feel like you're in the
574.88,576.55,Soviet Union when you're traveling here
576.56,577.75,because all the other former Soviet
577.76,579.67,countries like usbekistan Armenia
579.68,581.63,Georgia they've moved on they've
581.64,583.15,developed a lot and they've become a lot
583.16,584.47,more modern and different with new
584.48,586.389,governments and new systems in place but
586.399,588.79,here in transnistria it's literally like
588.8,590.99,you're in the Soviet Union as a traveler
591.0,592.269,that's cool as someone who's interested
592.279,594.43,in history and how the world works and
594.44,596.19,the influence that the Soviet Union had
596.2,598.31,on the world it's
598.32,600.55,fascinating so this bank here you only
600.56,602.949,have a local card yeah and it's not on
602.959,605.03,the Swift Code system so you can't use
605.04,607.19,it anywhere outside of trans anista so
607.2,609.31,ethnically they're a mix of movian
609.32,612.069,ukrainians Romanians and Russians if you
612.079,613.79,have the family heritage you are
613.8,616.71,eligible for all these passports oh wow
616.72,618.43,some people I know people who have five
618.44,620.71,passports really yeah okay so we're
620.72,623.19,going to an old Soviet buffet and it's
623.2,625.35,just as it was in the Soviet Union
625.36,627.11,grandmothers make all the food they put
627.12,628.91,it out in buffet style and you just take
628.92,630.59,what you want want and it's very cheap
630.6,633.67,and healthy perfect are you hungry
635.8,639.31,cow tasty oh my God see this is all
639.32,646.59,local people this is so
646.6,648.829,wild I actually met tourist here they're
648.839,650.99,from lvia you guys enjoying yeah we are
651.0,652.75,enjoying this because this is actually
652.76,654.99,part of our past we lived this but now
655.0,657.47,we are happy that we are out of this and
657.48,660.35,part of the western world thank God
660.36,661.829,going through the buffet here which
661.839,663.67,feels like Russian Grandma serving me
663.68,667.03,food thank you it's $3 a meal including
667.04,669.43,the water now this is a meal we got for
669.44,674.829,soup sour cream chicken cabbage
674.839,677.59,eggplant that up Yummy
677.6,679.629,Yummy in the light bulb here they have
679.639,681.79,the mascot from the 1980 Olympics which
681.8,683.269,was in Russia what do you think about
683.279,689.91,the cafe
689.92,691.55,check out how crazy the money Works in
691.56,693.19,transnistria so these are the Bills
693.2,694.75,they're actually the smallest bills in
694.76,696.269,the world they're tiny I have small
696.279,698.829,hands there's denominations of 25 rubles
698.839,700.03,yes they're called rubles like Russian
700.04,701.99,rubles but they're completely worthless
702.0,703.829,outside of transnistria and then you
703.839,706.55,have these plastic coins literally it's
706.56,707.629,the only place in the world where you
707.639,710.35,can find plastic coins here's one Ruble
710.36,712.269,it's a circle this is three rubles it's
712.279,714.15,a square so I guess if you're blind you
714.16,716.31,can feel the edges of it and realize the
716.32,718.829,denomination but yes they are completely
719.92,721.35,so freaking
721.36,723.389,weird like much of the region
723.399,725.11,transnistrian people follow Eastern
725.12,727.269,Orthodox Christianity which means Di and
727.279,728.75,her mother have to cover up now that
728.76,730.71,we're about to visit a church wow these
730.72,733.79,are beautiful churches here incredible
733.8,735.91,this was originally a mosque because the
735.92,737.829,Ottoman Empire controlled this region
737.839,740.269,and a Katarina the great sent her Army
740.279,742.31,from Russia to take over this area and
742.32,744.35,they did and now it's a Russian Orthodox
749.839,751.829,I've been in so many churches in my life
751.839,754.189,especially all over Eastern Europe this
754.199,756.11,one's so different the way everything
756.12,757.829,just feels like it's very raw and
757.839,760.67,natural and you got Jesus lit up here in
760.68,762.99,the sunlight and in this box which is
763.0,764.71,from Jerusalem they believe that this is
764.72,768.43,the original cross that Jesus died on
768.44,769.949,and something you'll notice that tells
769.959,772.269,you about how open and free the culture
772.279,774.389,is here if this was a gothic church in
774.399,776.35,Germany there would be security
776.36,777.829,everywhere and this would be in a box
777.839,779.87,with cameras on it there's no security
779.88,781.389,yeah nothing no one's going to take it
781.399,783.79,either no one's it's really rustic and

878.839,881.03,normal place it's so peaceful that's one
881.04,882.47,of the first things people say is how
882.48,884.189,peaceful it is I think from watching the
884.199,886.11,Western news too much they expect some
886.12,887.99,kind of marching in the street with
888.0,890.23,people with the Stalin tattooed on their
890.24,891.949,forehead or something and it's totally
891.959,894.23,normal calm peaceful yeah it's totally
894.24,896.189,peaceful which is cool how are you nice
896.199,900.23,to meet you I I like your hair class
900.24,901.99,he's like yeah I know I'm cool I'm

903.12,904.949,hipster Vibe going on with these kids
904.959,907.47,with the teenagers the teenagers we saw
907.48,909.71,girl with pink hair like chains baggy
909.72,912.31,pants it's a growing movement but
912.32,913.829,they're not exactly the same because
913.839,917.79,they're there's no drug culture here so
917.8,919.59,it's just the look here right yeah
919.6,921.71,Selena goz on the background de is
921.72,923.55,pointing out all the americanisms here
923.56,925.87,it was a Steve Jobs poster got Selena
925.88,929.11,Gomez that's about it not much more
929.12,931.629,American things going on giant heads of
931.639,934.189,Lenin are everywhere here and this one's
934.199,937.23,massive there a big head it's huge it's
937.24,938.55,one of the biggest ones in the whole
938.56,940.15,region after the fall of the Soviet
940.16,942.87,Union a lot of the places tore down all
942.88,944.47,the linen heads but all of ours are
944.48,946.389,intact it's just the infrastructure is
946.399,948.59,just like in the Soviet Union but that
948.6,951.15,begs the question who runs transnistria
951.16,952.71,hey guys I just quickly popped into my
952.72,954.71,hotel to tell you about the sponsor of
954.72,956.829,this video headspace if you've never
956.839,958.389,heard of the app it's been my favorite
958.399,960.389,way to medit date for The Last 5 Years
960.399,962.23,and I was so happy when they reached out
962.24,963.79,because it's a great product that I
963.8,965.87,actually use you guys probably know that
965.88,967.59,I'm on the road most days of the year
967.6,969.47,and due to my intense travels I've
969.48,971.99,developed a lot of stress and anxiety
972.0,974.47,holy and that's why I started using
974.48,976.829,headp space every morning for 5 to 7
976.839,978.79,minutes I open up the app and meditate
978.8,980.829,to clear my mind I find the refresh
980.839,982.509,meditations to be the most helpful
982.519,984.11,because it allows me to start each day
984.12,985.79,with unclouded thoughts and a calm
985.8,987.509,mindset and trust me when I tell you
987.519,989.509,that it's wildly impacted full
989.519,991.269,especially when I'm on a crazy travel
991.279,992.829,schedule like I've been on the last 2
992.839,995.069,months across 12
995.079,997.509,countries every morning in my hotel room
997.519,999.23,I start the day fresh and therefore I
999.24,1001.069,can make better videos and be more
1001.079,1003.309,productive just 10 days of headspace is

1018.199,1020.59,you all right now let's hit the streets
1020.6,1022.509,of transnistria we have our own
1022.519,1025.15,Parliament and we have our own President
1025.16,1026.669,we have our own police force we have our
1026.679,1029.47,own Army we have our own border guards
1029.48,1032.59,but we are Monopoly State there's a mega
1032.6,1034.429,Corporation Called Sheriff that anything
1034.439,1035.949,large they own it you know they're
1035.959,1037.789,benevolent they're not hurting anyone
1037.799,1039.27,they bring a lot of goods and services
1039.28,1040.99,here they're the largest employer of the
1041.0,1043.15,place there's one man that owns Sheriff
1043.16,1044.87,well it's more like a conglomerate but
1044.88,1046.87,um but there's a guy and no one knows
1046.88,1048.59,where he is he owns his own Island
1048.6,1050.43,somewh are there protests are there
1050.44,1052.029,people like we don't we don't like this
1052.039,1054.27,no they don't care um they have their
1054.28,1056.549,opinions but they're not strict about
1056.559,1057.789,this they don't they're not going to
1057.799,1059.39,feel insulted if you have a different
1059.4,1060.669,opinion and they're pretty much
1060.679,1062.549,apathetic unlike Americans yeah here
1062.559,1064.23,they're very apathetic about politics
1064.24,1066.07,because they realize they're the ones
1066.08,1067.669,that are in control of their lives not
1067.679,1069.63,government transnistria is so confusing
1069.64,1071.029,that I'm still trying to dig deeper
1071.039,1073.11,about what Tim just told me what exactly
1073.12,1075.35,is Sheriff well in simple terms it's the
1075.36,1077.19,biggest company in transnistria started
1077.2,1080.39,in 1993 by two cops and it runs almost
1080.4,1082.59,everything supermarkets gas stations a
1082.6,1084.789,mobile network TV channels and even a
1084.799,1086.789,soccer team it's basically a monopoly
1086.799,1088.43,that has deep ties to the government
1088.44,1090.669,making it hugely influential for many
1090.679,1092.19,sheriff is the ultimate symbol of
1092.2,1094.19,corruption and control shaping nearly
1094.2,1096.51,every part of life in transnistria see
1096.52,1099.31,the supermarket here is called Sheriff a
1101.039,1105.27,Sheriff yeah oh my godom
1105.28,1107.95,said we're in the sheriff grocery store
1107.96,1109.19,and the way that they all dressed with
1109.2,1110.63,like the local outfit that looks like
1110.64,1113.63,Super Mario Brothers just got this ice
1113.64,1116.63,cold bottle of vodka for
1116.64,1120.029,.30 cheapest vodka in the world it's
1120.039,1126.789,freezing cold ice
1129.159,1133.63,woo yeah that's strong that is
1133.64,1141.149,strong it's Vodka it's not water
1141.159,1143.07,we are now rolling up to a barge which
1143.08,1145.029,is basically a large you guess you don't
1145.039,1146.59,really call it a boat it's a giant piece
1146.6,1148.63,of Steel with pontoons underneath and
1148.64,1150.149,and that's how we're getting across yeah
1150.159,1152.23,this dates back to World War II because
1152.24,1153.47,in the old days they would have built
1153.48,1155.47,pontoon bridges here and tanks would
1155.48,1157.35,have crossed it and actually on our
1157.36,1159.909,River the nter there are old t34 still
1159.919,1161.83,on the bottom of the river so most of
1161.84,1164.35,the border is the river but in this case
1164.36,1166.75,it's not and so we can cross here
1166.76,1168.549,without passports these are the guys who
1168.559,1170.95,r run the barge so when they're not busy
1173.84,1176.27,fish actually I do more fish sometimes
1176.28,1177.789,we get on here and they're smashed on
1181.96,1184.99,yeah ah this is cool because this uh old
1185.0,1187.87,tree limb is the steering and breaking
1187.88,1190.43,mechanism for the barge they carved it
1190.44,1192.87,themselves that's so cool yeah the
1192.88,1194.549,movement's caused by the inertia of the
1194.559,1196.59,river that's steering but he's steering
1196.6,1199.07,and breaking with us yeah this gu this
1199.08,1201.33,guy's a legend man
1205.44,1208.669,yeah we are now into UL we've barged our
1210.0,1213.95,in p p across the barge I'm left
1213.96,1215.75,thinking in a place like transnistria
1215.76,1218.07,it's easy to focus on war Soviet history
1218.08,1219.71,and guys with big guns but there's
1219.72,1221.47,another side to this story one that
1221.48,1223.549,often goes unnoticed the vital role of
1223.559,1225.789,the Babushka in Russian Babushka means
1225.799,1227.669,grandmother but it can refer to any old
1227.679,1229.43,lady who is charming and hospitable I
1229.44,1230.99,can't wait to bring Diana and her mom to
1231.0,1232.43,meet some of these ladies and see how
1232.44,1238.63,they keep their old traditions

1520.919,1523.389,notes how did you end up in transnistria
1523.399,1525.59,after a few years of living in Poland I
1525.6,1527.789,found out that Maldova had dropped their
1527.799,1530.389,old Soviet Visa standards and I came
1530.399,1532.63,here by myself so I started working with
1532.64,1534.389,tourists and of course all local people
1534.399,1536.269,said no tourist will come here that's
1536.279,1537.95,silly they don't want to see the Soviet
1537.96,1540.23,stuff and I told them that's exactly why
1540.24,1541.71,they will come to be honest this is the
1541.72,1544.269,most fascinating slice of all of Europe
1544.279,1545.83,you literally feel like as close as you
1545.84,1547.789,can get to the actual Soviet Union we
1547.799,1550.07,are in the Town Center here of teraso

1799.799,1801.029,anywhere you are in the world when you
1801.039,1802.63,get out of the cities and when you go
1802.64,1804.669,into the rural places people are so
1804.679,1806.87,incredibly friendly and that's really
1806.88,1809.149,one of the morals of this story is that
1809.159,1811.23,people are happy here they live normal
1811.24,1813.31,lives there's all kind of crazy messed
1813.32,1815.19,up politics going on both here and
1815.2,1816.909,around the region but at the end of the
1816.919,1818.95,day people are just people they just
1818.96,1820.47,have the same wants and needs as me and
1820.48,1821.99,you and they want to just enjoy their
1822.0,1823.63,lives and that's been a really
1823.64,1825.71,reassuring thing to experience here in
1825.72,1827.549,transnistria after traveling to every
1827.559,1829.31,single country in the world and in
1829.32,1830.95,Europe I actually feel connection with
1839.48,1845.31,wow he wants to turn it into a giant
1845.32,1848.23,Museum the quality will be much better

1934.919,1937.629,uh come what is the best and the worst
1937.639,1941.83,part about living in
1941.84,1943.669,transnistria yeah he said like it's a
1943.679,1946.509,black soil and everything green I mean
1946.519,1948.95,you can grow everything yeah and uh
1948.96,1950.549,that's what he likes yeah is there
1950.559,1954.549,anything you don't like about living

1968.6,1970.35,so cool we were just talking about how
1970.36,1972.47,chill it is here it's just like a cool
1972.48,1973.629,place I don't know how to explain it
1973.639,1975.509,everyone's just hanging out before this
1975.519,1977.23,trip you don't know anything what do you
1977.24,1980.07,think now before I have the
1980.08,1982.629,awward and now description now it
1982.639,1984.47,changed you have a different thought
1984.48,1986.19,Bish away the
1986.2,1989.669,award description you come in with one
1989.679,1991.669,perception of how a placees and then you
1991.679,1993.35,realize that wow it's actually like
1993.36,1994.75,really cool here's the thing about
1994.76,1996.669,transnistria it might not be recognized
1996.679,1998.629,by the world but its story is impossible
1998.639,2000.47,to ignore from the Soviet Flags to the
2000.48,2002.31,war torn bunkers to the Babushka still
2002.32,2003.87,holding on to their traditions this
2003.88,2005.83,place truly is a time capsule but
2005.84,2007.59,despite being trapped in political limbo
2007.6,2009.43,the people here have found a way to live
2009.44,2011.23,to remember and to make the most of what
2011.24,2013.029,they've got at the end of the day it's
2013.039,2015.11,the uniquely Eastern European spirit
2015.12,2017.19,that defines transnistria so even though
2017.2,2018.87,only a few hundred people get to visit
2018.88,2020.389,each year what I've learned is that it's
2020.399,2022.029,often the most forgotten places that
2022.039,2023.75,have the most to teach us thanks for
2023.76,2025.269,watching and I'll see you in the next
