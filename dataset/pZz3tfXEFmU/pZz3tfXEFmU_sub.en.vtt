00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.833
Barbie dream house!

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:06.433
Hi, Barbie.

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.733
Hi, Barbie.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.133
[creepy music]

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.000
Barbie.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.200
See Barbie.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.533
-Barbie.
-Hi, Barbie!

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:18.866
-Barbieland.
-Barbie—

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.100
Barbie—

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.266
[creepy music continues]

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.800
Hi, Barbie.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.100
[heartbeat sounds]

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.000
Guess what, Barbie fans—

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.300
Hi, Barbie.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.800
-Hi, Barbie.
-Hi, Barbie!

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.400
In the summer of 2023, Barbie took over.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.166
[overlapping and repeated]
Barbie!

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.200
The film was inescapable.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.366
Put Barbie isn't the first movie

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.266
to do a massive summer takeover.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.033
“It is as if God created the devil...

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.066
and gave him...

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.566
Jaws.”

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.766
Jaws basically

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.733
invented the modern blockbuster,
I guess, is the way to put it.

00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:11.800
I’m Alissa Wilkinson.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.100
I’m a senior correspondent at Vox 
and a critic.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:19.800
Before Jaws, no movie had made $100 million 
at the box office.

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.866
This didn't happen by accident.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.700
It was all a strategy that started 
long before Jaws, the movie.

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:29.500
And—okay, so I could talk about Jaws for literally hours.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.900
But in the interest of time, 
here are the highlights:

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.700
[driving string music]

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.333
“From the bestselling novel...

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.366
Jaws.”

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.466
Jaws was a book first

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.333
which is true of a lot of movies obviously, 
and always has been.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.300
Producers at Universal acquired
the film rights to Jaws

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.100
before Peter Benchley even 
got the book published.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.066
They started pouring money 
into the book's marketing.

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.500
They got it into book clubs

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.033
designating it as Book-of-the-Month.

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:57.766
There was skywriting at beaches 
that said “Read Jaws.”

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.933
Hype was built and perhaps inevitably 

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:04.200
Jaws, the novel, became a blockbuster 
in its own right.

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:07.833
Sitting at the top of the bestsellers lists 
for 44 weeks straight.

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.200
The intellectual property was 
effectively leveraged.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:16.033
Then, just one year after 
the book release...

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.466
the film came out and 
it was... good.

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.500
A giant shark, beautiful cinematography

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.533
and an innovative score that kept you 
on the edge of your seat.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.600
It couldn't really be more appealing.

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:32.133
When the studio showed it to test audiences

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:34.233
they realized they had a massive hit 
on their hands.

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:37.366
And so they started sinking money 
early into marketing.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.266
So I believe the number they spent 
on marketing

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:42.133
was somewhere in the $1.8 million range.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.066
Or about $11 million in 2023 dollars.

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:48.033
That's not anything compared to the amount

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:51.700
that movies are marketed for now,
but it was a lot at the time.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.566
A large chunk of that cash 
was spent on television ads.

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:59.333
In the days before its opening weekend,
they saturated the market

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:03.233
buying 30 second spots on every prime time
television show

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:05.300
on all the major networks...

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:07.200
or at least the ones that would let them

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.100
which was about 80 to 85%.

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:11.966
Time magazine featured Jaws on its front cover...

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.666
and for a while it seemed like 
you couldn't escape the film.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.233
It's not just the idea

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:18.533
that you know the movie's 
coming out

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:21.000
but also that it's an event 
you need to be part of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.500
and that you'll be missing out 
if you don't take part in it.

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:29.733
The main reason that say

00:03:29.733 --> 00:03:31.600
I don't know, like 
a Citizen Kane

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.033
or 2001: A Space Odyssey are not 
considered blockbusters

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:36.566
is in that time

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:39.333
you would release a movie in maybe like 
one or two cities

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:40.933
and then it would roll out slowly.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.266
Jaws didn't follow that strategy.

00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:46.166
It opened in 409 theaters in the US

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.533
and 55 more in Canada 
on June 20th, 1975

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:52.400
squarely in the middle of summer

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.033
which makes sense as Jaws was all about 
warm weather and beaches.

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:59.433
But back then, big movies didn't often 
release in the summer.

00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:01.233
Why would summer be a good time?

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:04.133
You know, you want to be outside 
where it's nice

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:07.000
and this is sort of pre-air-conditioning 
for a lot of people.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.733
So maybe it's very uncomfortable.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.200
All these factors, 
the book promo

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.000
the intense movie promo, 
the timing...

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:18.500
it all led Jaws to become the highest grossing movie
ever made at that point

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.433
crossing the $100 million mark

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:23.066
just 61 days after its release.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.500
When something is successful in Hollywood

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.000
what we immediately see are repeats.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.966
Over and over, derivations, 
copies

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:35.633
but also just attempts to capture 
lightning in a bottle. Again.

00:04:35.633 --> 00:04:38.200
We have blockbusters every year 
since then...

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:41.366
that are using essentially the Jaws formula.

00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:45.433
The Star Wars movies, Indiana Jones movies, 
Mission Impossible movies.

00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:46.966
All of these different films

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:49.200
really count as blockbusters, 
in part because

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.500
they replicated that formula.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.966
Now, a lot changes between 
Jaws and Barbie...

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:56.833
but when you look at the overlying 
blockbuster strategy

00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:59.233
they're almost formulaicly identical.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.666
They both leverage preexisting IP, 
though with Barbie...

00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:04.400
It's much bigger than the Jaws thing.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.733
You know, we're talking about decades of toys, 
decades of commercials.

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:12.333
They were both released in the summer
on every screen possible...

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:15.933
and they both set market saturation 
to the extreme.

00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:18.066
But what separates Barbie from

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:20.433
all the blockbusters
that came before

00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:23.033
is that it had a much steeper uphill battle.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.400
There has always been the perception

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.400
among the predominantly male executives 
of Hollywood

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.633
that women will go see a movie 
starring a man

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:37.133
but men won't go see movies 
starring women.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.333
And whether or not that's

00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:42.233
a cultural product of just 
not having movies

00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:44.566
starring women is a big, 
big question.

00:05:44.633 --> 00:05:47.433
So making Barbie is obviously 
a gamble.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.200
To mitigate that gamble

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.800
the Barbie team needed 
to act strategically.

00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:53.633
The first step was elevating

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.966
the idea of what a Barbie movie could be.

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:59.666
They brought in someone with, 
I would say, a defined style

00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:03.766
or at least a defined idea of 
what kinds of stories she tells.

00:06:04.133 --> 00:06:06.366
Greta Gerwig has generally made smaller

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.533
thoughtful films about 
the human condition...

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.766
making her an unconventional choice
for something of this scale.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.333
It sent the message that 
Hollywood wasn't

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:16.766
just making a Barbie 
cash grab movie.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.333
The movie would be more elevated 
and subversive than you might expect.

00:06:20.466 --> 00:06:22.433
I mean, the first trailer references

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:25.933
the evolution of man scene
from 2001: A Space Odyssey...

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.500
a movie that came out in 1968 
that's like 3 hours long

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.033
and literally about all of human life,
which is very cool...

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.700
but also very film bro.

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:40.366
Which I can say because, you know, 
I mean, look at me.

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:45.000
That trailer was dropped before 
Avatar: The Way of Water...

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.966
a blockbuster that was poised to be a big hit...

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:50.200
meaning you could get maximum exposure.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.300
But it's not a typical pairing.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.700
You know: Horror movies usually have 
horror trailers preceding them.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.966
Action movies have action trailers.

00:06:58.066 --> 00:07:01.000
To put Barbie before Avatar 
was a clear signal

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.666
that they were trying to reach across

00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:06.166
to an audience that wouldn't immediately 
be into Barbie.

00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:09.700
For a long time

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.600
this is what Barbie looked like.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.966
But the movie and the marketing 
took a different approach

00:07:14.966 --> 00:07:16.800
representing more types of people

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.100
and allowing anybody to become Barbie.

00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:22.166
Either by using the selfie generator or...

00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:24.166
You can make a Barbie figure of yourself.

00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:25.633
You can stand in the pink box

00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:28.033
and take a picture and 
put it on Instagram.

00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:30.433
You know, I think I'm the only person
who hasn't done that

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:32.133
like in the world at this point.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.933
You could say in Barbie's dream house, 
thanks to Airbnb

00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:37.700
or watch your favorite interior designers

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.166
build the Barbie dreamhouse...

00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:40.700
thanks to HGTV.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.966
You could live the Barbie lifestyle in the real world.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.266
This isn't something you can do 
with other blockbusters.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.100
Like you could buy the Flash’s sneakers...

00:07:50.233 --> 00:07:53.766
but one: They never wears those sneakers
in the movie.

00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:55.566
Two, more importantly:

00:07:55.633 --> 00:07:59.266
They don't really let you embody 
the character fully.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.866
But you could be Barbie in one simple way.

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:05.466
It's pink.

00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:06.466
It's just pink.

00:08:06.466 --> 00:08:08.300
So you could walk around 
in pink clothing.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.400
And it was a Barbie thing.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.766
Or there's a cafe that popped up.

00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:13.366
That was the Barbie Cafe.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.366
It's hard to overstate the 
power of simplicity

00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:17.733
with brand tie ins.

00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:20.066
Like, I'd love to be Spider-Man...

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.333
but finding something with graphic design

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:25.233
that I like is... challenging.

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:27.366
But you want a Barbie burger?

00:08:27.366 --> 00:08:28.466
Give it some pink ooze

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.833
and you got yourself a brand tie-in.

00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:31.700
Barbie outfits?

00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:33.466
It's as easy as this.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.900
According to Josh Goldstein, 
the Head of Marketing at WB...

00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:40.566
it stopped being a marketing campaign 
and became a movement.

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:43.100
They didn't have to reach out to every brand

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.700
because every brand wanted 
a bite of the Barbie apple.

00:08:48.966 --> 00:08:50.466
Can I talk about Barbenheimer now?

00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:51.400
-[Ed, off-screen] Please!
-Okay!

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.233
Barbenheimer jokes started where it was like:

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:57.966
Isn't it funny that these two are 
coming out on the same day?

00:08:57.966 --> 00:08:58.533
And it is.

00:08:58.733 --> 00:08:59.666
One is dark.

00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:01.433
It's just dark.

00:09:01.433 --> 00:09:02.633
The other one is pink.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.366
Thematically, one is about death

00:09:04.366 --> 00:09:06.733
and the other one is maybe 
also about death.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.066
You ever think about dying?
[record scratch]

00:09:09.066 --> 00:09:10.633
Like that would be weird and funny.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:11.966
And then people thought:

00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:13.233
Well, wouldn't it be funnier if you went

00:09:13.233 --> 00:09:15.200
and saw both movies on the same day?

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.800
And the result of this, 
I think, is that Barbie...

00:09:19.033 --> 00:09:23.000
got a boost because men who might 
have felt weird about

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.533
just buying a ticket for a Barbie movie...

00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:27.766
now they're going to see it as part of 
a double feature.

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:28.600
So it's kind of a bit.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.500
And Oppenheimer definitely got a boost 
from the same.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.600
The marketing was a mix of strategy

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.800
luck and a bunch of tie ins 
and it paid off.

00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:41.500
The box office for Barbie 
was definitely surprising

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.600
in the way that the box office 
for Black Panther

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.400
was considered surprising at the time...

00:09:46.766 --> 00:09:49.200
which was that they expected it 
to make a lot of money.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.200
They just didn't expect it to make 
that much money...

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.800
that fast in the theater.

00:09:54.966 --> 00:09:56.833
Barbie crossed the billion dollar mark

00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:59.633
in just 17 days at the box office.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.833
Only 53 movies have done that so far.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.033
And Barbie is the only one 
solely directed by a woman.

00:10:07.733 --> 00:10:09.900
According to Variety, the Barbie 
marketing team

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.000
spent an estimated $150 million 
marketing the movie

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.200
against the production budget 
of $145 million.

00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:19.066
Meaning they spent more money

00:10:19.066 --> 00:10:21.633
marketing the movie 
than they did making it.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.633
This isn't uncommon...

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.266
but throwing money into marketing 
doesn't always work out.

00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:29.066
It might help your opening weekend

00:10:29.066 --> 00:10:32.566
but keeping that momentum going
is often harder.

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:36.100
One thing that's really unique about Barbie 
for 2023, anyhow

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.400
is that people are going back to see it
multiple times.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.133
And I think it's because it's sort of 
a unique film

00:10:43.133 --> 00:10:45.900
in the blockbuster world in that 
it's kind of subversive.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.266
It's got a little bit of everything 
for a cinephile

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:51.700
but it's also very warm and 
very warm-hearted.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.533
Like it's not a bummer of a movie 
and it's funny!

00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:58.233
To get to a billion generally 
you need both things:

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.533
A good movie and a great marketing campaign.

00:11:01.733 --> 00:11:04.466
In 2023, the year of Barbie...

00:11:04.933 --> 00:11:07.700
Warner Brothers was able to 
synthesize them both.

00:11:10.066 --> 00:11:11.600
Hey, if you're still around

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.633
thank you so much for watching this video.

00:11:13.633 --> 00:11:15.233
I genuinely appreciate it.

00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:16.633
Like with all our videos...

00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:20.033
there is just so much to put into every story

00:11:20.033 --> 00:11:21.266
and I couldn't fit it all in.

00:11:21.533 --> 00:11:24.000
But if you want to learn some more, 
I'm going to leave

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.466
some interesting podcasts in the description below

00:11:26.466 --> 00:11:31.000
which were awesome and so fun 
and dove into Jaws and Barbie...

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.333
in ways that I just couldn't 
in the making of this video.

00:11:34.966 --> 00:11:37.800
And while you're in the description,
you might notice one other link:

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.033
vox.com/give-now.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.866
If you click it, it'll take you here: 
To a web page

00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:46.433
where you can make a contribution 
to keep Vox's journalism free.

00:11:46.566 --> 00:11:48.300
We here at Vox are big believers

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.300
that information should be free for everyone...

00:11:50.366 --> 00:11:52.533
which is why this video is here on YouTube

00:11:52.533 --> 00:11:54.500
and not locked behind a paywall somewhere.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
But if you wanted to support Vox's journalism...

00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:00.933
the best way to do that is by 
becoming a contributor.

00:12:00.966 --> 00:12:02.166
As a special thank you to those

00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:03.566
who make recurring contributions

00:12:03.566 --> 00:12:06.933
you get access to behind-the-scenes, 
tutorials, and Q&amp;As

00:12:06.933 --> 00:12:09.700
with Vox journalists from across 
the entire newsroom.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.866
And I think this is an important thing to stress

00:12:11.866 --> 00:12:15.766
because donations wouldn't just go to 
these fun movie videos.

00:12:15.966 --> 00:12:18.233
Video coverage of really important topics

00:12:18.233 --> 00:12:20.966
like the upcoming 2024 election, 
for instance.

00:12:20.966 --> 00:12:23.733
The goal right now is 85,000 total

00:12:23.733 --> 00:12:26.233
contributions by the end of 2023.

00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:27.800
To keep on pace for that

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.900
we need to add 2500 contributions 
this month.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.633
Now we know that not everyone

00:12:32.633 --> 00:12:34.033
is in a place where they can support us.

00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:36.366
So if you can't, that's totally fine.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.033
Feel free to give us a thumbs up

00:12:38.033 --> 00:12:40.566
because that's free and goes a really long way.

00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:43.100
But if you do have the means to contribute...

00:12:43.133 --> 00:12:45.700
head over to vox.com/give-now

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.566
and consider making a contribution.
