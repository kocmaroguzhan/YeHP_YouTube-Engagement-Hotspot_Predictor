20,40,"Barbie — Hi , Barbie . Guess what , Barbie fans — Hi , Barbie . Hi , Barbie . -Hi , Barbie ! In the summer of 2023 ,"
40,60,Barbie took over . Barbie ! The film was inescapable . Put Barbie is n't the first movie to do a massive summer takeover . “
60,80,"It is as if God created the devil ... “ It is as if God created the devil ... and gave him ... Jaws . ” Jaws basically invented the modern blockbuster , I guess , is the way to put it . I ’m Alissa Wilkinson . I ’m a senior correspondent at Vox and a critic . Before Jaws , no movie had made $ 100 million at the box office ."
80,100,"This did n't happen by accident . It was all a strategy that started long before Jaws , the movie . And — okay , so I could talk about Jaws for literally hours . But in the interest of time , here are the highlights : “ From the bestselling novel ... Jaws . ” Jaws was a book first which is"
100,120,"true of a lot of movies obviously , and always has been . Producers at Universal acquired the film rights to Jaws before Peter Benchley even got the book published . They started pouring money into the book 's marketing . They got it into book clubs designating it as Book - of - the - Month . There was skywriting at beaches that said “ Read Jaws . ” Hype was built and perhaps"
120,140,"inevitably Jaws , the novel , became a blockbuster in its own right . Sitting at the top of the bestsellers lists for 44 weeks straight . The intellectual property was effectively leveraged . Then , just one year after the book release ... the film came out and it was ... good ."
140,160,"A giant shark , beautiful cinematography and an innovative score that kept you on the edge of your seat . It could n't really be more appealing . When the studio showed it to test audiences they realized they had a massive hit on their hands . And so they started sinking money early into marketing . So I believe the number they spent on marketing was"
160,180,"somewhere in the $ 1.8 million range . Or about $ 11 million in 2023 dollars . That 's not anything compared to the amount that movies are marketed for now , but it was a lot at the time . A large chunk of that cash was spent on television ads . In the days before its opening weekend , they saturated the market buying 30"
180,200,second spots on every prime time television show on all the major networks ... or at least the ones that would let them which was about 80 to 85 % . Time magazine featured Jaws on its front cover ... and for a while it seemed like you could n't escape the film . It 's not just the idea that you know the movie 's coming out but also that it 's an event
200,220,"you need to be part of and that you 'll be missing out if you do n't take part in it . The main reason that say I do n't know , like a Citizen Kane or 2001 : A Space Odyssey are not considered blockbusters is in that time you would release a movie in maybe like one or two cities and then it"
220,240,"would roll out slowly . Jaws did n't follow that strategy . It opened in 409 theaters in the US and 55 more in Canada on June 20th , 1975 squarely in the middle of summer which makes sense as Jaws was all about warm weather and beaches . But back then , big movies did n't often release in the summer . Why"
240,260,"would summer be a good time ? You know , you want to be outside where it 's nice and this is sort of pre - air - conditioning for a lot of people . So maybe it 's very uncomfortable . All these factors , the book promo the intense movie promo , the timing ... it all led Jaws to become the highest grossing movie ever made at that point crossing the $ 100"
260,280,"million mark just 61 days after its release . When something is successful in Hollywood what we immediately see are repeats . Over and over , derivations , copies but also just attempts to capture lightning in a bottle . Again . We have blockbusters every year since then ... that are using"
280,300,"essentially the Jaws formula . The Star Wars movies , Indiana Jones movies , Mission Impossible movies . All of these different films really count as blockbusters , in part because they replicated that formula . Now , a lot changes between Jaws and Barbie ... but when you look at the overlying blockbuster strategy they 're almost formulaicly identical . They both"
300,320,"leverage preexisting IP , though with Barbie ... It 's much bigger than the Jaws thing . You know , we 're talking about decades of toys , decades of commercials . They were both released in the summer on every screen possible ... and they both set market saturation to the extreme . But what separates Barbie from all the blockbusters that came"
320,340,before is that it had a much steeper uphill battle . There has always been the perception among the predominantly male executives of Hollywood that women will go see a movie starring a man but men wo n't go see movies starring women . And whether or not that 's a
340,360,"cultural product of just not having movies starring women is a big , big question . So making Barbie is obviously a gamble . To mitigate that gamble the Barbie team needed to act strategically . The first step was elevating the idea of what a Barbie movie could be . They brought in someone with , I would say , a defined style or"
360,380,at least a defined idea of what kinds of stories she tells . Greta Gerwig has generally made smaller thoughtful films about the human condition ... making her an unconventional choice for something of this scale . It sent the message that Hollywood was n't just making a Barbie cash grab movie . The movie would be more elevated and subversive than you might
380,400,"expect . I mean , the first trailer references the evolution of man scene from 2001 : A Space Odyssey ... a movie that came out in 1968 that 's like 3 hours long and literally about all of human life , which is very cool ... but also very film bro . Which I can say because , you know , I mean ,"
400,420,look at me . That trailer was dropped before The Way of Water ... a blockbuster that was poised to be a big hit ... meaning you could get maximum exposure . But it 's not a typical pairing . Horror movies usually have horror trailers preceding them . Action movies have action trailers . To put Barbie before Avatar
420,440,was a clear signal that they were trying to reach across to an audience that would n't immediately be into Barbie . For a long time this is what Barbie looked like . But the movie and the marketing took a different approach representing more types of people and allowing anybody to become Barbie . Either
440,460,"by using the selfie generator or ... You can make a Barbie figure of yourself . You can stand in the pink box and take a picture and put it on Instagram . You know , I think I 'm the only person who has n't done that like in the world at this point . You could say in Barbie 's dream house , thanks to Airbnb or watch your favorite interior designers build the Barbie dreamhouse ..."
460,480,"thanks to HGTV . You could live the Barbie lifestyle in the real world . This is n't something you can do with other blockbusters . Like you could buy the Flash ’s sneakers ... but one : They never wears those sneakers in the movie . Two , more importantly : They do n't really let you embody the character fully . But"
480,500,"you could be Barbie in one simple way . It 's pink . It 's just pink . So you could walk around in pink clothing . And it was a Barbie thing . Or there 's a cafe that popped up . That was the Barbie Cafe . It 's hard to overstate the power of simplicity with brand tie ins . Like , I 'd love to be Spider -"
500,520,"Man ... but finding something with graphic design that I like is ... challenging . But you want a Barbie burger ? Give it some pink ooze and you got yourself a brand tie - in . Barbie outfits ? It 's as easy as this . According to Josh Goldstein , the Head of Marketing at WB ... it stopped being a marketing campaign and became"
520,540,a movement . They did n't have to reach out to every brand because every brand wanted a bite of the Barbie apple . Can I talk about Barbenheimer now ? Please ! -Okay ! Barbenheimer jokes started where it was like : Is n't it funny that these two are coming out on the same day ? And it is . One is dark .
540,560,"It 's just dark . The other one is pink . Thematically , one is about death and the other one is maybe also about death . You ever think about dying ? Like that would be weird and funny . And then people thought : Well , would n't it be funnier if you went and saw both movies on the same day ? And the result of this , I think , is that Barbie ... got a boost"
560,580,because men who might have felt weird about just buying a ticket for a Barbie movie ... now they 're going to see it as part of a double feature . So it 's kind of a bit . And Oppenheimer definitely got a boost from the same . The marketing was a mix of strategy luck and a bunch of tie ins and it paid off . The box office for
580,600,Barbie was definitely surprising in the way that the box office for Black Panther was considered surprising at the time ... which was that they expected it to make a lot of money . They just did n't expect it to make that much money ... that fast in the theater . Barbie crossed the billion dollar mark in just 17 days at the box office .
600,620,"Only 53 movies have done that so far . And Barbie is the only one solely directed by a woman . According to Variety , the Barbie marketing team spent an estimated $ 150 million marketing the movie against the production budget of $ 145 million . Meaning they spent more money marketing the"
620,640,"movie than they did making it . This is n't uncommon ... but throwing money into marketing does n't always work out . It might help your opening weekend but keeping that momentum going is often harder . One thing that 's really unique about Barbie for 2023 , anyhow is that people are going back to see it multiple times . And I"
640,660,think it 's because it 's sort of a unique film in the blockbuster world in that it 's kind of subversive . It 's got a little bit of everything for a cinephile but it 's also very warm and very warm - hearted . Like it 's not a bummer of a movie and it 's funny ! To get to a billion generally you need both things : A good movie and a
660,680,"great marketing campaign . In 2023 , the year of Barbie ... Warner Brothers was able to synthesize them both . Hey , if you 're still around thank you so much for watching this video . I genuinely appreciate it . Like with all our videos ... there is just so much to put into every"
