00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:05.830
Madagascar.&nbsp;

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.459
An island off the coast of Africa.&nbsp;

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:12.000
It’s one of the most biologically diverse
places in the world.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.279
Almost all of its plants and animals aren’t
found anywhere else on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.699
And when we looked at it from space, 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:19.670
we saw a spot. 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.519
A massive dark circle,

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.190
almost perfectly round,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.670
over thirteen kilometers in diameter,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.830
and big enough that roads are diverted on
either side of it.&nbsp;

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.730
Looking at it from the side, we could see

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.849
it was a mountain.

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.743
And if you zoomed all the way in, you could
see a village

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:39.241
nestled in the crater at its center.&nbsp;

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:41.910
8 kilometers from the closest labeled town
on Google Maps.&nbsp;

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.550
Isolated in a remote part of a remote
region of a geographically isolated country.&nbsp;

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.770
It looked like it could have been there for
generations.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.910
But if you looked backward through time …&nbsp;

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.000
… each year …&nbsp;

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.370
… it gets smaller and smaller …&nbsp;

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.250
… and before 2008, there was no one there
at all.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.558
I wanted to try to answer one question:

00:01:04.558 --> 00:01:06.533
Why did these people move to such

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.909
 an incredibly isolated place?

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:15.670
I was really starting from zero here.&nbsp;

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.530
I didn't know anyone in Madagascar.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.020
I didn't know that much about Madagascar.&nbsp;

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.720
But the question was: could we get in touch with
the people living here just by using the internet?&nbsp;

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.380
The closest location tags were on the edges
of the mountain: a butcher shop, a playground,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.600
and a historical landmark.&nbsp;

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.430
But none of them were real — they all seemed
to be random references to the popular Japanese

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.659
manga and anime series Attack on Titan, written
in Russian.&nbsp;

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.710
The ones that did look real — churches,
hospitals, schools — didn’t have much

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.600
of a presence on the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.250
So we looked at content that had been geotagged
nearby.&nbsp;

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.430
First on Twitter: using the coordinates of
the village, and a search radius.&nbsp;

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.395
Until finally at 12 kilometers away …&nbsp;

00:01:56.395 --> 00:01:57.500
… we found someone.&nbsp;

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.100
A nonprofit worker who had posted from a nearby
village in 2014.&nbsp;

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.689
We asked if he knew about the village on the
mountain.&nbsp;

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.659
But he never got back to us.&nbsp;

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.020
On Instagram, we looked for pictures tagged
in the nearest town, Antaniditra

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.072
and found an aid organization
that had posted pictures taken there.

00:02:14.072 --> 00:02:15.847
We asked, but they didn’t know.&nbsp;

00:02:15.847 --> 00:02:18.019
They’d never actually been on the mountain
at all.&nbsp;

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.670
And finally we looked at geotags on YouTube.&nbsp;

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.168
And there was a video.

00:02:21.168 --> 00:02:24.680
Geotagged right next to the village on top
of the mountain.&nbsp;

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.950
But, then…&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.550
It was just more Attack on Titan stuff.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.550
Also written in Russian.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.360
After a while, it felt like the internet alone
was not going to tell us very much.&nbsp;

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.691
So we started reaching out to experts who had worked
in Madagascar.

00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:41.082
Experts in agriculture.

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.501
&nbsp;And experts in biogeography.

00:02:56.945 --> 00:03:01.200
Madagascar is a country of almost 29 million
people: slightly more than Australia, slightly

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.650
fewer than Texas.&nbsp;

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.989
A majority of the country's population — over 60 percent — lives in rural settings a lot like this one.&nbsp;

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.480
But this village was particularly remote.&nbsp;

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.159
If you zoom out, the closest major city is
a place called Tsiroanomandidy.&nbsp;

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.435
18 kilometers away, with a population of over
44,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:22.520
At this point in the process, it felt like we might need to take
a more drastic approach.&nbsp;

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.860
Maybe we could hire someone to make the journey
up the mountain to the village itself.&nbsp;

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.760
Someone in Madagascar.&nbsp;

00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:32.570
That’s how we met Lalie.&nbsp;

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.570
Hi Christopher.&nbsp;

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.769
Lalie runs a production company in Madagascar,
in the capital city of Antananarivo.&nbsp;

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.790
She was down to make the trip.&nbsp;

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.750
She started to gather a crew…&nbsp;

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.750
… make local contacts …&nbsp;

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.880
… and figure out how to get from
Antananarivo all the way here.&nbsp;

00:03:47.554 --> 00:03:50.080
They weren't exactly sure yet how they'd get
up to the village.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.049
Or how they’d establish contact once they
got there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.063 --> 00:03:59.840
But they knew they were going to have to do
it in just a few days in the middle of

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.470
Madagascar’s hot rainy season.&nbsp;

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.989
And early one morning in January, they went.

00:04:07.376 --> 00:04:11.672
This is Toussinah. 
She’s going to be our guide.&nbsp;

00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:15.459
This is Haja, he’s an historian&nbsp;
This is Vahambola, our fixer.&nbsp;

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.530
This is José, our very focused driver.&nbsp;

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.771
And this is me, you know me already.&nbsp;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.781
As they approached the mountain, Lalie sent
us messages every step of the way.&nbsp;

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.430
Until, finally,&nbsp;

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.537
After traveling 10 kilometers by 
motorcycle and on foot … 

00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:04.089
they made it to the top of the mountain.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.190
But when they got there

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.620
and were about to descend to the village
in the crater …&nbsp;

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.954
… a massive storm appeared on the horizon.&nbsp;

00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:18.855
And they had to turn back.&nbsp;

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:25.476
They got extremely close.

00:05:25.476 --> 00:05:30.069
But making contact with the village would have
to wait until the end of the rainy season.

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.139
Which was …&nbsp;

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.639
... in May.&nbsp;

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.490
Four months away.&nbsp;

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:39.990
Still, all the research we’d done so
far gave us a detailed idea of what this place

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.990
looked like.&nbsp;

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.594
What Lalie’s team did see looked green,
lush, 

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.699
and clearly extremely difficult to access.

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.370
But there was so much we didn’t know.&nbsp;

00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:53.505
Before Lalie went in January, she wasn’t
convinced that anybody lived there at all.

00:05:53.505 --> 00:05:57.278
There’s the small group of houses at the
very top in the very middle 

00:05:57.278 --> 00:05:58.928
that we’ve kinda been interested in.&nbsp;

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.160
So I turned to some very basic Googling.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.849
And I found an article about earthquakes in
Madagascar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:15.449
The article described how a team of researchers
mapped Madagascar via seismic tomography.&nbsp;

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.160
That’s "tomography" not "topography," because
it’s mapping the Earth’s interior, not

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.710
exterior, like a CT scan for the planet.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.780
All of these measurements produced this final
map of the entire island.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.270
With colors labeling the different ages and
kinds of rock.&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.370
And here, in the center of the map, I could
see one perfectly circular dot…

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.830
I pulled it into Photoshop, overlaid it with
the map…

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.229
And it lined up with the mountain exactly.

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.710
According to the key, that meant that the
mountain dated back to the Cretaceous Period:

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.459
sometime between 66 and 145 million years
ago.&nbsp;

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:51.046
And ...

00:06:51.046 --> 00:06:52.778
... it was volcanic.

00:06:58.093 --> 00:07:01.501
This looked like a very, very
extinct volcano.

00:07:01.501 --> 00:07:04.379
But we wanted to know for sure.&nbsp;

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:09.349
So I started looking for a volcano expert
from Madagascar who could explain it to me.&nbsp;

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:12.000
And that led me to Tsilavo Raharimahefa.&nbsp;

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.669
He showed me a map&nbsp;

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.020
from a detailed geological survey of the area.&nbsp;

00:07:36.424 --> 00:07:38.599
90 million years old.&nbsp;

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:39.599
Older than Mount Everest.

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:40.599
The Grand Canyon.

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:41.599
Vesuvius.

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.604
This thing was ancient.

00:07:43.604 --> 00:07:47.889
90 million years meant that this thing had
been extinct for a very, very long time.&nbsp;

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:50.376
But that number was significant for another
reason.

00:07:58.581 --> 00:07:59.520
Okay.&nbsp;

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.009
Tsilavo is talking about this moment, right here.

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:06.259
When India broke apart from Madagascar.&nbsp;

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:08.610
Because these rocks are 90 million years old,&nbsp;

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.870
it makes sense that the volcano might
have something to do with this massive separation

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.590
of continents.&nbsp;

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.735
So we went looking for experts who knew more
about the breakup of Madagascar and India.&nbsp;

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.300
And we found Joe Meert.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.730
A geology professor who’s written a
bunch about 

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.042
the movement and formation of continents.&nbsp;

00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:29.669
This was a real crash course on volcanic geology,

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:34.495
so I asked our motion designer Matt to help 
me make this a little bit easier to follow.

00:08:35.567 --> 00:08:40.937
Madagascar and India happened to be located
beneath this really deep-seated mantle source,

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.529
they're called plumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:45.996
When that plume reaches the planet’s crust,
it forms a hot spot.

00:08:45.996 --> 00:08:50.450
As Madagascar moved over the hotspot, it burned
a hole through Madagascar

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.160
and produced all the volcanics all over
the island.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.510
As Madagascar’s continental plate continued
to move,

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.010
those volcanoes were eventually cut off
from the hotspot.&nbsp;

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.130
And without a heat source, they cooled and
collapsed.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.450
And then you're left with the plumbing system
that was underneath that volcano.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:12.310
So that’s what we were looking at: the collapsed
remnants of a volcano formed by a hotspot

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.190
that had broken up apart Madagascar and India.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.835
At this point, I had no idea what 
any of this might have to do 

00:09:17.835 --> 00:09:20.295
with the village we could see on Google Earth.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.370
But right about then, we heard back from another
Malagasy expert we’d emailed.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.300
He sent us a link to mindat.org — this is
like the Wikipedia of minerals and mines ...

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.550
… and it had a page about the mountain.&nbsp;

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.490
Including its name: The Ambohiby Massif.&nbsp;

00:09:37.222 --> 00:09:41.671
Finally. We knew the name of this mountain
that had been unlabeled 

00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:42.950
on every other map we’d seen so far.&nbsp;

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.540
And we could search for it.&nbsp;

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.688
We found maps from 1899, 1903, and 1916,

00:09:49.688 --> 00:09:53.794
where the Ambohiby was always labeled
as a lush forest …

00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:56.376
… the only one for almost 100 kilometers. 

00:09:56.376 --> 00:09:58.572
That definitely didn’t seem to be the case anymore.

00:09:58.572 --> 00:10:01.381
 But maybe these old trees were a clue.

00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:02.381
We kept looking.&nbsp;

00:10:02.381 --> 00:10:04.770
And we found old reports. 

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.100
One from 1933 said that at the “highest
part of the massif 

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.479
there is a very open valley, called by the
indigenous Andranomangatsiaka, 

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:15.320
or "where we find fresh water."

00:10:17.597 --> 00:10:18.563
Water.&nbsp;

00:10:18.563 --> 00:10:20.912
Maybe that's why the villagers chose to move there.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.770
The mountain’s higher elevation meant it
got more moisture,

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.760
feeding these streams that flowed down the
mountain in every direction…&nbsp;

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.807
and making the center a perfect place for
a village to thrive.&nbsp;

00:10:33.807 --> 00:10:36.980
Then we tried to find reports that were 
a little bit more recent. 

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:42.000
And on Google Scholar, we found
a 2012 paper about the origins of the Ambohiby.&nbsp;

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.304
It covered everything from the geochemistry,
to plate tectonics, 

00:10:45.304 --> 00:10:48.310
to microscopic images of its rocks.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.170
And it included rock samples taken right next to the crater village.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.399
The paper was written by a South African geoscientist
named Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi.&nbsp;

00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:01.424
And if she took rock samples from right here,
when the village already looked like this,

00:11:01.424 --> 00:11:04.167
she had to have been in contact with the people living there.&nbsp;

00:11:04.167 --> 00:11:06.700
Mukosi was busy doing field research for the
next few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.440
So in the meantime, we dug deeper
into her paper.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.320
And it told us what the formation actually was.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.500
An alkaline ring complex.&nbsp;

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.410
Alkaline refers to the chemistry of the magma.&nbsp;

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.575
It’s the kind of molten rock that appears when
continents break apart, like Madagascar and

00:11:21.575 --> 00:11:23.769
India did 90 million years ago.&nbsp;

00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:28.167
I took this new term, and looked at
dozens more across the world.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.910
In Sudan,

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.910
Egypt,

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:32.910
Niger,

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.910
Russia,

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:34.910
Namibia,

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:35.910
Zimbabwe,

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.060
The United States.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.792
They were everywhere.&nbsp;

00:11:38.792 --> 00:11:41.300
A whole planet covered in circles.&nbsp;

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.540
The remnants of long extinct volcanoes.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.610
I wanted to talk to someone who could tell
me why a community of people would want to

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.200
live on top of an alkaline ring complex.&nbsp;

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.000
So I went looking for the most famous researcher

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.362
of the most famous alkaline ring complex out there.

00:11:57.362 --> 00:12:00.510
That’s when this caught my eye.&nbsp;

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:03.985
The Richat Structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.985 --> 00:12:06.000
Also called the Eye of the Sahara.&nbsp;

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.240
It’s an alkaline ring complex in Mauritania surrounded by
conspiracy theories.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.140
Even on Google Maps, where it’s littered

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.680
with comments saying that it's the site of Atlantis.&nbsp;

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.330
And that “nobody knows what it is!”&nbsp;

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330
But geologist Michel Jébrak 
does know what it is.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.802
He’s done tons of research there, 

00:12:21.802 --> 00:12:25.309
and even helped get an illustration
of it onto Mauritania’s currency.

00:12:49.017 --> 00:12:50.190
Soil.&nbsp;

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.769
Maybe that was why they moved here.

00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:55.185
This alkaline ring complex, formed 
when continents broke apart,

00:12:55.185 --> 00:12:58.965
 left behind a valley with remarkably fertile soil.&nbsp;

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.933
There was one last person who 
might know something

00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:06.646
about the community living on top
of the Ambohiby Complex:

00:13:06.646 --> 00:13:11.209
Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi, the geoscientist
who had studied it.

00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:13.502
When she was back from doing field research,
we spoke.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.440
One of the things that really caught us in
the first place about this location was the

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:42.670
fact that at the crater of the ring complex
there is what looks like a farm right in the

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.179
very middle -- do you know what I’m talking
about?&nbsp;

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.769
I’d missed this the whole time.&nbsp;

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:10.310
Mukosi’s research was published in 2012.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:15.980
But she had actually visited the Ambohiby
five years earlier, in 2007.&nbsp;

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.860
Before anyone had moved here in the first
place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.956
So that was it.&nbsp;

00:14:20.956 --> 00:14:25.800
We’d been trying to learn about an incredibly
remote village in an incredibly remote part of the country.

00:14:26.876 --> 00:14:30.701
And the one person who had formally 
studied it most recently

00:14:31.584 --> 00:14:34.354
had done so before the village even existed.&nbsp;

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.310
We had all this research.&nbsp;

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.310
And we were stumped.&nbsp;

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:42.550
But now, the rainy season was over.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.660
And we finally had a chance to send Lalie
and her crew to make the journey again.&nbsp;

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:51.521
Hi Christopher, we are leaving now.

00:14:51.521 --> 00:14:54.000
So we are heading to Tsiroanomandidy.&nbsp;

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.959
We are now on the way.

00:14:56.959 --> 00:15:00.949
Lalie brought a whole new team, including
Rado Andriamanisa, a filmmaker who captured

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:04.292
scenes as they drove through the Madagascar
countryside.

00:15:04.292 --> 00:15:07.550
Of pineapple vendors …&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.410
... basket weavers …&nbsp;

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.845
... and rice farmers.&nbsp;

00:15:14.922 --> 00:15:20.130
We are 1 hour and 45 minutes, approximately,
from Tsiroanomandidy.&nbsp;

00:15:23.713 --> 00:15:25.520
Tsiroanomandidy.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.384
The closest major city to the Ambohiby.

00:15:32.939 --> 00:15:36.080
When they made it there, they picked up their
final crew member: Johary.&nbsp;

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.519
A Tsiroanomandidy local
who would be their guide.&nbsp;

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:39.643
Hello!

00:15:39.643 --> 00:15:41.141
Hello! Can you hear me now?

00:15:41.265 --> 00:15:43.570
He told me he’d climbed the Ambohiby many times.&nbsp;

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.930
And even wrote his master’s thesis on its water
resources.&nbsp;

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.360
But had never been to the village
at its center.&nbsp;

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.259
Antaniditra. Just 8 kilometers away. 

00:15:57.259 --> 00:16:01.397
From there, they could travel to interview people
living on the outskirts of the massif.

00:16:01.397 --> 00:16:03.550
The crater village's closest neighbors.

00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:14.680
The crew asked them what they thought made this
place special.&nbsp;

00:16:29.762 --> 00:16:32.690
They’d met the people living closest to
the crater village.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.505
But climbing all the way up the mountain would
take a full day.&nbsp;

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.275
Early the next morning,&nbsp;

00:16:44.275 --> 00:16:46.095
they set off&nbsp;

00:16:46.095 --> 00:16:49.276
for one last shot at reaching the village.&nbsp;

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:55.244
What you see behind me, there, this line,
there ...

00:16:55.244 --> 00:16:56.836
It’s the crater.

00:17:13.024 --> 00:17:16.292
It’s like, in the middle of nowhere.

00:17:16.292 --> 00:17:18.000
It’s a beautiful nowhere.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.435
But still.&nbsp;

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.250
Until at last … they arrived.&nbsp;

00:17:27.757 --> 00:17:30.918
So we are now approaching the crater.

00:17:30.918 --> 00:17:33.390
And they saw the village — up close.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:37.440
Full of dozens of houses, livestock … and
people.&nbsp;

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:48.340
But as soon as they drove closer, things became
tense.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.470
Some people in the village think that we are
a team of spies, 

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.119
coming to take them guilty for something.

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:07.110
We still need to wait. 

00:18:09.334 --> 00:18:12.930
After two and a half hours, one of the towns
leaders came to talk.&nbsp;

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.998
We finally succeeded to find our facilitator.&nbsp;

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:42.780
More specifically, they migrated from Manandriana,
a district in the region of Amoron’i Mania,

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.120
in the central highlands of Madagascar.&nbsp;

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.120
A journey of over 380 kilometers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.280
Like the majority of people in Amoron’i
Mania, the Ambohiby residents are Betsileo.&nbsp;

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.110
The third largest of Madagascar’s 18 main
ethnic groups.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:01.790
Meaning they didn't just migrate to a new home –&nbsp;
they also became an ethnic minority.&nbsp;

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.842
Now living in a place where
the Merina people are the majority.

00:19:08.344 --> 00:19:11.097
It still wasn’t clear why they chose this place

00:19:11.097 --> 00:19:14.365
in particular, somewhere so remote.&nbsp;

00:19:14.365 --> 00:19:18.491
Until they sat down to interview 
Razafinatiala, one of the village’s elders.

00:19:55.446 --> 00:19:56.751
And they gave it a name.&nbsp;

00:19:56.751 --> 00:19:57.687
Anosibe Ambohiby.&nbsp;

00:19:57.687 --> 00:19:59.376
Anosibe Ambohiby.&nbsp;

00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:03.292
Anosibe Ambohiby — or "Big Island" Ambohiby.&nbsp;

00:20:14.127 --> 00:20:16.720
So we had an answer about why they lived here.&nbsp;

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.390
And why they had traveled all this way to
live in a place like this.&nbsp;

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.220
It was for the water and it was for the soil.&nbsp;

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.419
But more than anything else, it was for space.

00:20:26.419 --> 00:20:29.103
And it’s easy to see why.&nbsp;

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:33.330
In the entire district of Tsiroanomandidy,
there are just over 49 people per square kilometer.&nbsp;

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:38.169
But in the migrants’ original home of Manadriana,
that density is more than twice as high.

00:20:38.567 --> 00:20:40.458
And for farmers like them, space

00:20:40.458 --> 00:20:43.496
to plant,
to breed livestock, to build a life

00:20:43.496 --> 00:20:44.800
is everything.

00:20:45.543 --> 00:20:49.167
And then the villagers took Lalie and the
crew to see what they’d done 

00:20:49.167 --> 00:20:50.876
with all of that space.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.900
A massive field of hundreds of lemon and orange
trees.&nbsp;

00:21:14.281 --> 00:21:17.190
The citrus are a 
cash crop: fruits grown for the purpose of

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.295
selling at a market.

00:21:26.595 --> 00:21:27.960
But to sell their produce at a market, 

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.170
they have to transport it
down the mountain to Antaniditra. 

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.909
The same difficult journey that Lalie 
and her team had just done.

00:22:09.442 --> 00:22:13.279
Remoteness was the thing that first fascinated
us about this village.

00:22:13.647 --> 00:22:15.808
And it was a central part of their story.&nbsp;

00:22:15.808 --> 00:22:18.874
But it was a story that stretched far beyond
this place.&nbsp;

00:22:18.874 --> 00:22:22.450
Madagascar has some of the least developed
road networks in the world

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:26.830
with just 5 kilometers of road per 100
square kilometers of land.&nbsp;

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:31.370
The majority of Madagascar’s population
lives in rural areas a lot like this one.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.429
But only a tiny fraction of that rural population
lives within 2 kilometers of a road that’s

00:22:36.429 --> 00:22:38.040
usable all year long.&nbsp;

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.919
Which means that almost 16 million people
live essentially unconnected.&nbsp;

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:44.052
Having better, more connected roads

00:22:44.052 --> 00:22:48.000
means an easier time accessing
schools, hospitals, and markets.  

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.390
An easier time building a better life.&nbsp;

00:22:56.253 --> 00:22:58.358
Hey, hi Christopher, how are you doing?&nbsp;

00:22:58.358 --> 00:23:00.600
We’ve been to the crater finally.

00:23:02.442 --> 00:23:07.830
They live in a very, very, very, remote area.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:12.149
Because, this is like the center of the crater.&nbsp;

00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:18.288
And the way they live in the middle of the crater
and they can sustain themselves …

00:23:18.288 --> 00:23:20.334
it’s amazing.&nbsp;

00:23:20.522 --> 00:23:21.900
But to access there …

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.184
it’s not an easy life.&nbsp;

00:23:29.202 --> 00:23:32.630
When I was going through all the footage Lalie's
team sent us after they made it home,&nbsp;

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:38.170
I couldn’t stop looking at this perfect
match to the first image we saw of the village.&nbsp;

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:39.490
And it struck me…

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:40.490
Apart from a few photos …

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:43.360
taken with cameras hundreds of kilometers
up in the sky ...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.541
… there’s basically no record of Anosibe
Ambohiby anywhere on the internet.&nbsp;

00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:49.486
Until right now.&nbsp;

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.150
With the internet, we can look at just about
any part of the planet.&nbsp;

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.000
Some of the places we find might be made up.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.880
Or might be surrounded by conspiracy theories
instead of facts.&nbsp;

00:24:01.186 --> 00:24:03.590
And some we can’t learn much about at all

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.250
without showing up, asking questions

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.626
and letting the people there

00:24:09.626 --> 00:24:11.626
tell their story.
