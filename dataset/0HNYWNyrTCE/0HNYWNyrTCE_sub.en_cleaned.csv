13.599,15.87,please. An offensive
15.88,19.51,item. Give me your Roblox. I just wanted
19.52,21.91,"to play some Roblox today. Oh, all I"
21.92,23.75,have to do is agree. You want me to
23.76,27.029,"admit I did all of those? Okay, so we're"
27.039,29.669,back on Roblox. Y'all told me to play
29.679,32.549,"get a snack at 4:00 a.m., which sounds"
32.559,34.709,right up my alleyway. I love a late
34.719,36.91,"night snack. It's me, your"
36.92,39.19,self-conscious. I am interrupting your
39.2,41.67,sleep to say that you are starving. You
41.68,43.75,appear to be waking up due to your
43.76,45.67,starvation. Sounds about right. You
45.68,47.43,"honestly can't sleep in this condition,"
47.44,49.43,so I advise getting a late night snack.
49.44,51.91,"Just try to be sneaky about it. Okay,"
51.92,53.51,"anyways, you're waking up. I'll see you"
53.52,55.59,"soon. So, they entered my mind, woke me"
55.6,57.83,up to get a late night snack. What's the
57.84,59.83,worst that can possibly happen? Here's
59.84,62.229,my bedroom. 4 in the morning. We got
62.239,65.03,some memes on the wall. Laughing orange.
65.04,67.67,That's from like 2009. Statue
67.68,69.429,"collection. Clearly, I haven't"
69.439,71.75,accumulated all of these yet. I'm still
71.76,74.71,a child. Yummy. Eat sword. Delicious.
74.72,76.109,And a
76.119,80.23,garbag. A garbag with mysterious purple
80.24,83.03,gas floating out. Let's pick up these
83.04,85.83,"ticks. Oh, cash. Cash money. We have"
85.84,88.63,money. Wow. Am I going to buy a snack?
88.64,91.51,Whoa. Who tossed all of these plants
91.52,93.91,around? Why is there a plant on the
93.92,96.069,ceiling? Mother is going to be pissed
96.079,97.83,when she sees this. I'm not really
97.84,99.19,feeling the blue carpet in this
99.2,101.51,household. What is this window? Leads to
101.52,103.99,this mysterious room with disco balls.
104.0,106.149,Must be the party room. How to get a
106.159,109.35,"snack at 4:00 a.m. Oh, look. Robux."
109.36,111.67,I'mma pick all this money up. And that's
111.68,113.749,how you get free Robux. Another plant.
113.759,115.749,"So, this one has not been knocked over"
115.759,118.469,yet. More money. Let's just grab as much
118.479,122.069,"money as we can. We have 24, 25, 26"
122.079,125.03,monies. Carpet. There's a carpet on top
125.04,127.109,of the carpet. My dogs would see this
127.119,128.63,"and be like, ""This is the peeing"
128.64,131.99,"carpet."" More mysterious purple gas"
132.0,134.47,bubbling out of the gar bag. Thanks for
134.48,136.55,"playing. I didn't even play. Okay, you"
136.56,138.47,know what? The whole objective is to go
138.48,140.229,"to the kitchen. Oh, I think we're in the"
140.239,142.229,kitchen. There's a fridge. Open it. And
142.239,144.869,should we get a snack? Some Bloxy Cola.
144.879,147.589,Why does that rhyme with Ebola? Bloxy
147.599,150.15,Cola. Ebola. I have to pick up the Robux
150.16,151.91,in the fridge. What's this guy? He
151.92,153.19,doesn't look like food. Is this
153.2,155.91,somebody's head? Why is there a head in
155.92,158.47,the freezer and some cobwebs? I know for
158.48,160.71,a fact that spiders cannot live in the
160.72,162.71,freezer or the fridge. Let's close it.
162.72,165.03,"Anyway, should we turn the stove on?"
165.04,167.91,Perhaps cook a Bloxy Cola. How to make a
167.92,169.99,good breakfast. It's 4:00 a.m. Is it
170.0,172.15,"breakfast time already? I think so. One,"
172.16,174.39,"get egg. Two, cook egg on stove. Three,"
174.4,176.47,"place cooked egg on plate. Four, place"
176.48,179.03,"orange juice. Five, enjoy. Oh, okay."
179.04,181.43,Somehow I think we must acquire an egg
181.44,183.75,or some chips for noobs. What do you
183.76,185.35,mean I can't pick this up? I can only
185.36,187.03,have one thing at a time. I think we're
187.04,188.63,going to have to put down our Bloxy
188.64,190.55,"soda. Wait, was that candle there a"
190.56,192.149,second ago? I don't think that candle
192.159,195.43,"was there a second ago. Okay, chips. Can"
195.44,197.67,"we eat them? Wait, I just picked up some"
197.68,199.509,"chips, but it's it's a man in my"
199.519,201.67,inventory. Why is there a little man?
201.68,204.11,"Anyways, I think we should go acquire an"
204.12,206.869,egg. That's crazy. I turned on the stove
206.879,208.869,"and it turned on the lights. Oh, look."
208.879,210.55,More money. What do I need all this
210.56,212.47,money for? I'm in my house. Am I going
212.48,214.99,to go out and buy
215.0,217.19,groceries? Uh-oh. I threw the chips
217.2,219.589,"away. I can't get them anymore. Oh, but"
219.599,221.63,now I can pick up the orange that I Hey
221.64,225.35,y with another game of video. Looks like
225.36,227.589,we are going to play a game called Get a
227.599,229.75,Snack at 4 a.m. I can't move. You're
229.76,231.43,holding me hostage. Good thing it's not
231.44,233.11,at 3:00 a.m. That's when all the creepy
233.12,235.309,"stuff happens,"
235.319,239.27,"right? Okay. Welcome, Tutti Frutti 9000."
239.28,241.91,"Well, thank you. What happened? I got"
241.92,243.75,the uh-oh ending. The orange. I thought
243.76,245.589,we were going to milk him and make
245.599,247.75,orange juice out of him. Got that rumbly
247.76,249.429,"tumbly. Honestly, can't sleep in this"
249.439,251.91,"condition, so I I He just won't shut up."
251.92,253.27,That's why they call him the annoying
253.28,255.11,"orange, I guess. Okay, we're going to"
255.12,256.789,"try this again, except we're going to"
256.799,258.229,find an egg. I saw something move right
258.239,260.789,"here. Oh, these are just trees."
260.799,263.99,"Wow, that's me outside. Let's take a"
264.0,266.469,"walk at 4:00 a.m. Oh, how convenient."
266.479,268.95,There's a store right across the street
268.96,271.51,"from my house that me, a 12-year-old,"
271.52,274.31,can go to by myself. And it's open 24
274.32,275.99,hours. How convenient. And they also
276.0,278.39,have the mysterious purple gas leaking
278.4,280.87,out of the garbagi. Place an item here
280.88,283.03,and talk to me about it to purchase.
283.04,285.03,"Bro's asleep. Okay, what have they gone"
285.04,286.95,in the store? Do they got eggs? I think
286.96,288.95,we should get a egg. or this mysterious
288.96,290.909,floating and rotating
290.919,294.95,orb. Do you feel timelines shifting?
294.96,296.55,What does that even mean? There's free
296.56,298.95,"money at this grocery store. Cool. Ah,"
298.96,301.83,eggs. I can't pick up the eggs because I
301.84,304.39,have this mysterious orb. We no longer
304.4,306.31,sell toothpaste and orange juice
306.32,308.07,together due to the amount of people
308.08,310.469,buying and consuming them both. Don't do
310.479,312.07,this unless it is in a video game.
312.08,313.35,"Definitely not. H Yeah, you're not"
313.36,314.39,supposed to. It's supposed to be really
314.4,315.43,bad for your teeth. You're not supposed
315.44,317.029,to brush your teeth right after having
317.039,319.39,orange juice because orange juice is so
319.4,321.51,"acidic. God, I can't get anything"
321.52,323.749,because I have this orb. Out of order
323.759,325.749,due to being too cold. What? We can't
325.759,327.749,have ice cream sandwiches because it's
327.759,329.87,"too cold. Okay, let me throw away my"
329.88,333.35,orb. Wo! Did you really just throw away
333.36,336.87,a store item right in the trash? Sh. I
336.88,338.629,did no such thing. What's wrong with
338.639,340.71,you? I thought you weren't looking. How
340.72,342.79,was he able to see? You didn't place
342.8,344.469,"anything. Oh, okay. Sorry. Okay, hold"
345.4,348.629,Egg. Let's just ignore that I threw away
348.639,350.629,a magical orb and we're just going to
350.639,352.71,get the eggs. You sure you want to buy
352.72,355.83,this egg? It'll cost you $25. Talk to me
355.84,358.189,"again to purchase, bro."
358.199,360.95,$25. Eggs in real life aren't even that
360.96,363.11,"expensive, man. Inflation has gone"
363.12,364.79,through the roof. I'm going have to
364.8,367.35,sacrifice my rent money to get this egg.
367.36,369.35,Your inventory is full. Get rid of that
369.36,371.59,"item. You can pick this up. Okay, hold"
371.6,373.67,"on. I have to take the orange juice. Oh,"
373.68,375.79,did I just steal it? Uh-oh.
375.8,378.469,Uh-oh. Who are you? And why is the world
378.479,380.23,red? Did you really think I wouldn't see
380.24,382.469,"a stealing? Uh, I don't have anything."
382.479,385.99,"It's time for you to pay the price. Bro,"
386.0,387.95,I thought we were in my
387.96,391.35,dreamland. Did he just un alive me for
391.36,393.99,taking some orange juice? You should buy
394.0,396.55,"the item first. Ah, okay. Thank you. I"
396.56,398.15,guess we learned a very valuable life
398.16,399.83,lesson today. Don't steal the orange
399.84,401.59,juice. I think what I have to do next
401.6,404.629,"time is buy the egg, go home, drop it"
404.639,406.469,"off, and then buy the orange juice, and"
406.479,408.55,go home and drop it off. Why is it so
408.56,410.79,difficult to have a snack these days?
410.8,413.909,I'm so hungry. I could eat a blue Roblox
413.919,415.35,"head. Okay, we're going to take our"
416.919,419.83,soda. This is our snack. Chips for noobs
419.84,422.43,and some Bloxy soda.
422.44,426.71,Nom. That was delicious. Epic breakfast.
426.72,428.23,This is something you'd eat while
428.24,430.87,gaming. Nice. I want to eat the head in
430.88,433.27,"the freezer. Is that possible? Okay,"
433.28,434.95,"that might have been an epic breakfast,"
434.96,436.87,but it's definitely not an ideal
436.88,439.51,breakfast. Not for a growing young lad
439.52,442.15,like myself. I need to get all the money
442.16,444.15,in this house. Anything that mother and
444.16,446.469,"father leave around, I'm going to use it"
446.479,449.11,to buy some eggs and some orange juice.
449.12,450.71,I'm going to have the ultimate
450.72,453.43,"breakfast. There's me. Oh, it's so dark"
453.44,455.909,"out. Oh, the moon is still out now."
455.919,458.07,"Okay, guys. No shoplifting. Oh, why does"
458.08,459.909,this car look like a sticker? This is my
461.16,463.67,Cashier. It's not even a real car. It's
463.68,466.39,"a piece of paper. Oh, what is this? What"
466.4,468.95,is this guy? Maybe we should not talk to
468.96,470.629,strangers on the way to the grocery
470.639,473.11,store at 4 in the morning. Purple man
473.12,475.35,"gives you a bad feeling. It's me, purple"
475.36,477.43,guy. I think he's very friendly. He
477.44,479.43,ain't doing nothing but being purple. Is
479.44,481.589,being purple a crime? There's so many
481.599,483.99,monies on the floor. Don't mind if I do.
484.0,485.43,"I'm going to take all of these. Okay,"
485.44,487.67,shut up. I'm going to put it witch brew.
487.68,490.15,"That wasn't regular Bloxy soda. Look,"
490.16,491.67,put this in the trash. Why can't I put
491.68,494.79,"it in the trash? Okay, that was trash."
494.8,497.749,"Oh, look. Money. Okay, a single egg. All"
497.759,500.15,"right, Mr. Cashier Man, shut up and take"
500.16,502.27,my money. One
502.28,506.309,"egg. Yes, I put the item here. I do want"
506.319,508.869,"to buy. Okay, will you let me leave now?"
508.879,510.71,"I hope so. No distractions. Good night,"
510.72,513.029,"purple guy. Good night, cashier's car."
513.039,515.909,I'm on my way to go home and make a
515.919,518.63,delightful breakfast. Turn on the stove.
518.64,520.87,I'm going to place my egg directly on
520.88,523.43,the stove. No pan. Be raw dog in it.
523.44,525.11,Cooking my egg. This is taking a long
525.12,526.23,time. I'm going to go get my orange
526.24,528.23,juice while it cooks. And hopefully the
528.24,529.99,house doesn't burn down by the time I
530.0,532.47,"get back. Oh, money. I got free money"
532.48,534.509,"everywhere here. Hello, purple guy. I'm"
534.519,537.75,"back. All right, here comes the orange"
537.76,540.23,juice. Sway to more money just in case
540.24,541.829,this sippy cup of orange juice cost
541.839,544.23,something ridiculous like $37. Why can't
544.24,546.63,"I pick it up, bro? Why can't I get the"
547.48,550.99,juice? Why is there an
551.0,553.23,alarm? What did I
553.24,556.55,"do? House fire. Oh, I didn't think the"
556.56,558.949,egg would cook that fast. You left the
558.959,562.55,stove on for too long. Crazy how that
562.56,564.31,can happen. I didn't know how long the
564.32,565.91,egg was going to take to cook. I thought
565.92,567.59,I was going to go back to the house and
567.6,568.87,it was going to be perfectly scrambled
568.88,570.15,right in front of me. I just wanted a
570.16,572.63,snack at 4:00 a.m. House casually burns
572.64,574.71,"down. Okay, we're going to do this right"
574.72,577.67,this time. Turn on egg and cook it. I'm
577.68,579.19,watching the house. I'm making sure it
579.2,582.23,"doesn't burn down. Oh, that's it. Oh,"
582.24,584.71,wow. I turned around for 2 seconds and
584.72,589.509,it's a giant egg. Oh no. Oh no. I tried
589.519,592.31,to turn off the dial. The house is on
592.32,594.55,fire. What do you want me to do? I might
594.56,596.949,as well jump in it. The house burns
596.959,599.43,down. I burned down with it. Goodbye
599.44,601.269,"world. Okay, we're going to make the"
601.279,603.75,perfect breakfast. We have exactly 3
603.76,606.87,seconds to turn off the stove once the
606.88,609.75,egg is done. No waiting. No admiring its
609.76,613.11,"yokiness once it's done cooking. Okay,"
613.12,615.19,it's off. Pick up the egg. Hurry up. The
615.2,617.269,"egg is on the table. I repeat, the egg"
617.279,619.11,is on the table. Nobody eat it. I'm
619.12,620.949,going to the store to get my orange
620.959,623.43,juice. I'll be right back. Nobody better
623.44,626.23,interrupt my snack time. I hope $20 is
626.24,628.389,enough for some orange juice. No
628.399,630.87,distractions. I'm getting my juice. I
630.88,633.269,"got the orange juice. Wake up, cashier."
633.279,635.19,"Man, give it to me before I steal it."
635.2,638.389,"$30. $30 for orange juice, bro. Where am"
638.399,641.389,I going to get $30 from? We got money in
641.399,644.389,"here. Ah, $28. Oh, there's money in the"
644.399,645.99,"back. Okay, I'm stealing from the store"
646.0,647.59,to pay the store. Prices here are
647.6,650.15,ridiculous. Got my orange juice. Nobody
650.16,651.829,can stop me. What is that in the trash
651.839,653.509,can? Let me throw away a puppy. Why
653.519,655.11,"would you throw away a puppy? Anyways,"
655.12,656.949,no distractions. I'm still tired and
656.959,659.19,hangry. If I go home and my egg has
659.2,660.949,"disappeared off the dining table, I'mma"
660.959,663.59,"freak out. Ah, yes. It's still here."
663.6,665.829,"Okay, are you guys ready? Get egg cook"
665.839,667.829,on stove top. Place cooked egg on plate.
667.839,669.71,We have already done that. Place orange
669.72,672.54,juice and enjoy.
675.44,678.87,"Wow, the perfect ideal breakfast. That"
678.88,681.35,was delicious. Well done. That's a good
681.36,683.11,"breakfast right there. Yes, I know."
683.12,685.509,"Thank you. Oh, my statue collection. I"
685.519,688.47,"got a statue for shoplifting, fire,"
688.48,691.35,"breakfast, and orange. Oh, purple guy."
691.36,693.11,"Wow, I told you he was a nice guy. He"
693.12,696.31,gave me a whole statue. There's a 1 in75
696.32,699.19,chance to meet the purple man. What is
699.2,701.35,under my bed? What is that? Hi. If
701.36,702.71,"you're seeing this, you've successfully"
702.72,704.389,managed to generate my thoughts into
704.399,706.15,objects you could see since I can't
706.16,708.069,actually speak directly. Each timeline
708.079,709.829,has one of these notes in it. Can you
709.839,711.91,find them? I'll try. I thought the
711.92,714.31,"objective was to get breakfast, not find"
714.32,717.19,notes. Whoa. What is that? Who put that
717.2,720.63,there? E jump scare. I don't think
720.64,722.79,Flamingo is mentally capable of owning a
722.8,725.35,"gun. Oh, there's a whole other room. How"
725.36,727.11,"did I not see this, bro? My father"
727.12,728.949,figure. Is he dead? I thought it was a
728.959,730.71,bathtub. I thought he pulled a Hannah
730.72,732.23,"Baker. Oh, okay. I'm just going to steal"
732.24,733.35,his money. I don't know if I should wake
733.36,737.269,him up. Uh-oh. I got the Colgate. I have
737.279,740.11,a very naughty
740.12,743.19,"idea. Oh, just as I thought. You could"
743.2,745.509,"pick the gold gate up, put it on the"
745.519,748.949,plate as food. I know what I would like
748.959,752.15,as a midnight snack. $30 orange juice.
752.16,754.55,Let's go. I'm writing this before my
754.56,756.55,inevitable downfall. This world is
756.56,759.03,strange. I'm the one who has to keep it
759.04,761.509,"safe. I will break soon. Okay. Well, we"
761.519,763.829,have to go eat our toothpaste and drink
763.839,766.31,our orange juice at the same time before
766.32,769.19,"the downfall happens. Okay, I can"
769.2,772.389,finally enjoy a nice cold glass of
772.399,774.47,orange juice with some Colgate
777.24,780.55,Nom delicious. That was delicious. You
780.56,782.23,probably shouldn't drink the orange
782.24,784.79,juice and then the Colgate. Wink wink.
784.8,786.55,"Yeah, don't do it. Your teeth will"
786.56,789.35,"actually fall out. Oh, apparently I saw"
789.36,791.23,a solar
791.24,794.15,"eclipse. Wow, I didn't get a statue for"
794.16,796.389,having orange juice in Colgate. I feel
796.399,798.47,"ripped off. But anyways, that's all for"
