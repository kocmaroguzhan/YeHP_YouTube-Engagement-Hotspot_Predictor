430,435,"eat the head in the freezer . Is that possible ? Okay , that might have been an epic breakfast ,"
435,440,but it 's definitely not an ideal breakfast . Not for a growing young lad like
440,445,myself . I need to get all the money in this house . Anything that mother and father leave
445,450,"around , I 'm going to use it to buy some eggs and some orange juice . I 'm going to"

460,465,Cashier . It 's not even a real car . It 's a piece of paper .
465,470,"Oh , what is this ? What is this guy ? Maybe we should not talk to strangers on the way"
470,475,"to the grocery store at 4 in the morning . Purple man gives you a bad feeling . It 's me ,"
475,480,purple guy . I think he 's very friendly . He ai n't doing nothing but being purple . Is being
480,485,purple a crime ? There 's so many monies on the floor . Do n't mind if I do . I 'm going to take all of
485,490,"these . Okay , shut up . I 'm going to put it witch brew . That was n't regular Bloxy soda ."
490,495,"Look , put this in the trash . Why ca n't I put it in the trash ? Okay , that was trash ."
495,500,"Oh , look . Money . Okay , a single egg . All right , Mr. Cashier Man , shut up and"

505,510,"here . I do want to buy . Okay , will you let me leave now ? I hope so . No"
510,515,"distractions . Good night , purple guy . Good night , cashier 's car . I 'm on my way to go"
515,520,home and make a delightful breakfast . Turn on the stove . I 'm going to place my
520,525,egg directly on the stove . No pan . Be raw dog in it . Cooking my egg . This is taking a
525,530,long time . I 'm going to go get my orange juice while it cooks . And hopefully the house does n't burn down by the time I
530,535,"get back . Oh , money . I got free money get back . Oh , money . I got free money everywhere here . Hello , purple guy . I 'm back ."
535,540,"All right , here comes the orange juice . Sway to more money just in"
540,545,case this sippy cup of orange juice cost something ridiculous like $ 37 . Why ca n't I pick it
545,550,"up , bro ? Why ca n't I get the juice ? Why is"
550,555,"there an alarm ? What did I do ? House fire . Oh , I"
555,560,did n't think the egg would cook that fast . You left the stove on
560,565,for too long . Crazy how that can happen . I did n't know how long the egg was going to
565,570,take to cook . I thought I was going to go back to the house and it was going to be perfectly scrambled right in front of me . I just
570,575,"wanted a snack at 4:00 a.m. House casually burns down . Okay , we 're going to do this right"
575,580,this time . Turn on egg and cook it . I 'm watching the house . I 'm making sure it does n't
580,585,"burn down . Oh , that 's it . Oh , wow . I turned around for 2 seconds and"
585,590,it 's a giant egg . Oh no . Oh no . I tried to
590,595,turn off the dial . The house is on fire . What do you want me to do ? I might as
595,600,well jump in it . The house burns down . I burned down with it . Goodbye world .
600,605,"Okay , we 're going to make the perfect breakfast . We have exactly 3 seconds to"
605,610,turn off the stove once the egg is done . No waiting . No admiring its
610,615,"yokiness once it 's done cooking . Okay , it 's off . Pick up the egg . Hurry up ."
615,620,"The egg is on the table . I repeat , the egg is on the table . Nobody eat it . I 'm going to the"
620,625,store to get my orange juice . I 'll be right back . Nobody better interrupt my snack
625,630,time . I hope $ 20 is enough for some orange juice . No distractions . I 'm
630,635,"getting my juice . I got the orange juice . Wake up , cashier . Man , give it to me before I"
635,640,"steal it . $ 30 . $ 30 for orange juice , bro . Where am I going to get $ 30"
640,645,"from ? We got money in here . Ah , $ 28 . Oh , there 's money in the back . Okay , I 'm"
645,650,stealing from the store to pay the store . Prices here are ridiculous . Got my orange juice .
650,655,Nobody can stop me . What is that in the trash can ? Let me throw away a puppy . Why would you throw away a puppy ?
655,660,"Anyways , no distractions . I 'm still tired and hangry . If I go home and my egg has disappeared off"
660,665,"the dining table , I'mma freak out . Ah , yes . It 's still here . Okay , are you guys"
665,670,ready ? Get egg cook on stove top . Place cooked egg on plate . We have already done that . Place orange
670,675,juice and enjoy .
675,680,"Wow , the perfect ideal breakfast . That was delicious ."
680,685,"Well done . That 's a good breakfast right there . Yes , I know . Thank you . Oh , my statue"
685,690,"collection . I got a statue for shoplifting , fire , breakfast , and"
690,695,"orange . Oh , purple guy . Wow , I told you he was a nice guy . He gave me a whole statue ."
695,700,There 's a 1 in75 chance to meet the purple man . What is under my
700,705,"bed ? What is that ? Hi . If you 're seeing this , you 've successfully managed to generate my thoughts into objects"
705,710,you could see since I ca n't actually speak directly . Each timeline has one of these notes in it . Can you
710,715,"find them ? I 'll try . I thought the objective was to get breakfast , not find notes ."
715,720,Whoa . What is that ? Who put that there ? E jump scare . I do n't
720,725,"think Flamingo is mentally capable of owning a gun . Oh , there 's a whole other"
725,730,"room . How did I not see this , bro ? My father figure . Is he dead ? I thought it was a bathtub . I thought he"
730,735,"pulled a Hannah Baker . Oh , okay . I 'm just going to steal his money . I do n't know if I should wake him up . Uh - oh . I"
735,740,got the Colgate . I have a very
740,745,"naughty idea . Oh , just as I thought . You could pick the gold gate up , put"
745,750,it on the plate as food . I know what I would like as a
750,755,midnight snack . $ 30 orange juice . Let 's go . I 'm writing this before my
755,760,inevitable downfall . This world is strange . I 'm the one who has to keep it safe . I will
760,765,"break soon . Okay . Well , we have to go eat our toothpaste and drink our orange juice"
765,770,"at the same time before the downfall happens . Okay , I can finally"
770,775,enjoy a nice cold glass of orange juice with some Colgate
775,780,Nom delicious . That was
780,785,delicious . You probably should n't drink the orange juice and then the Colgate . Wink wink .
785,790,"Yeah , do n't do it . Your teeth will actually fall out . Oh , apparently I saw a"
790,795,"solar eclipse . Wow , I did n't get a statue for having"
