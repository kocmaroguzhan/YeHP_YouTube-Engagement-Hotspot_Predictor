20,25,"For the past 20 years , I 've been"
25,30,helping Malaysian and other Southeast Asians to speak better
30,35,"English . And through training thousands of Southeast Asians ,"
35,40,I 've discovered a very surprising truth . I 've discovered that how
40,45,well somebody communicates in English actually has very little to do
45,50,with their English level . It has a lot to do with their attitude
50,55,towards English . There are people out there who have a
55,60,"very low level of English , and they can communicate very , very well . One of them that I"
60,65,"remember was a student , a participant of mine named Faizal . He was a factory"
65,70,"supervisor - English level very , very low - but this guy could just sit and"
70,75,"listen to anybody , very calmly , clearly , and then he could respond ,"
75,80,"absolutely express his thoughts beautifully , at a very low"
80,85,"level of English . So , today I want to share with you what is so"
85,90,different about people like Faizal ? How do they do it ? And
90,95,"second of all , why is this so important not only to you , but to your children , to your"
95,100,"community , and to the future of Malaysia ? And third of all , what 's one thing you"
100,105,"can do , starting today , if you want to speak with that calm , clear"
105,110,"confidence that people like Faizal have . First of all , what is so"
110,115,"different ? How do people like Faizal do it ? To answer that question , I 'm"
115,120,"going to take you back about 10 years , okay ? I was training staff at that time , and my"
120,125,"daughter , at that time , was taking piano lessons . And I started"
125,130,to notice two really strong similarities between my
130,135,daughter 's attitude or thinking towards playing the piano and a
135,140,lot of Malaysians ' thinking or attitude towards English .
140,145,"First of all , I should tell you my daughter absolutely hated piano ,"
145,150,"hated the lessons , hated practicing . This is my daughter practicing piano ,"
150,155,okay ? This is as good as it got . This is the real thing .
155,160,"And she dreaded going to piano lessons because to my daughter ,"
160,165,"going to piano lessons , she was filled with this sort of dread . Because"
165,170,"it was all about not screwing up , right ? Because like a"
170,175,"lot of piano students , to both my daughter and her teacher , her success"
175,180,in piano was measured by how few mistakes she made . At
180,185,"the same time , I noticed that a lot of Malaysians went into English conversations with the"
185,190,same sort of feeling of dread . This sort of feeling that they were going to be
190,195,"judged by how many mistakes they were going to make , and whether or not they were going"
195,200,"to screw up . Now , the second similarity that I noticed was to"
200,205,"do with self- image . My daughter , she knew what good piano sounded like , right ? Because"
205,210,"we 've all heard good piano . And she knew what her level was , and she"
210,215,knew how long she 'd have to play for to play like that . And
215,220,"a lot of Malaysians , I noticed , had this idea of what good proper"
220,225,"English is supposed to sound like , and what their I see a lot of you nod -"
225,230,"and what their English sounded like , and how far they would have to go to get there ."
230,235,And they also felt like they were like my daughter just
235,240,"bad , bad piano player , bad English speaker , right ? My English not"
240,245,"so good , lah . Can not . Sorry , yah . Can not . Ah - So I could see these"
245,250,"similarities , but I still could n't figure out , okay , what is it about these people like Faizal ,"
250,255,"that are so different , that can just do it smoothly , calmly , with"
255,260,"confidence ? One day , I discovered that answer , and I discovered it"
260,265,"quite by chance . It was a day when my computer broke down , and I had to go to a"
265,270,"cybercafe . Okay , it was my first time , and I discovered cybercafes are disgusting"
270,275,"places , okay ? They 're really gross . They 're smelly , and they 're filled with"
275,280,"boys . And they 're all playing noisy , violent games . They 're just"
280,285,"disgusting places . But I had to go there . So I sat down , and I started"
285,290,noticing this guy beside me . And I became very interested in this guy next to me .
290,295,"Now , this guy is playing this game that is basically , it 's like"
295,300,shooting people until they die . And that 's it . That
300,305,"'s the game , right ? And I 'm noticing that this guy is not very good ."
305,310,"In fact , he 's terrible , right ? Because I 'm looking , and I 'm seeing , like , a lot of"
310,315,"shooting and ... not much dying , right ?"
315,320,What really interested me was behind this lousy player were
320,325,"three of his friends , sort of standing there watching him play . What I"
325,330,"really noticed was even though this guy was terrible , even though his friends were"
330,335,"watching him , there was no embarrassment . There was no feeling of being judged . There was no"
335,340,"shyness . In fact , quite the opposite . This guy 's totally focused on"
340,345,"the bad guys , smile on his face . All he can think"
345,350,"about is killing these guys , right ? And I 'm watching him . And I"
350,355,suddenly realize : this is it . This is the same
355,360,"attitude that people like Faizal have when they speak English ,"
360,365,"just like this guy . When Faizal goes into an English conversation ,"
365,370,he does n't feel judged . He is entirely focused on the person that he 's
370,375,speaking to and the result he wants to get . He 's got no self -
375,380,"awareness , no thoughts about his own mistakes . I want to"
380,385,"share with you a real , true example , to paint a picture , of somebody who speaks"
385,390,English like they are playing piano and someone who speaks English like they are
390,395,playing a computer game . And this is a true story . It happened to me . A
395,400,"while ago , I was in a pharmacy . I had to buy omega ; my"
400,405,"doctor said I should get omega . And I go to the shelf , there 's tons of omega ,"
405,410,"there 's omega that 's high in DHA , omega that 's high in EPA ,"
410,415,"and I do n't know which one to buy . Now , the sales rep happened to be there . And"
415,420,"I saw she 's like this well - dressed , professional woman . I walk over to her , and I"
420,425,"see this look as she sees me , this sort of it 's a look I recognize very well ."
425,430,Her eyes go all wide . It 's sort of that panic : Oh my God ! I 've got to speak to a native
430,435,"speaker ; she 's going to judge me and notice my mistakes . I go up to her , and I"
435,440,explain my situation : which omega do I get ? And she starts
440,445,explaining to me everything about DHA and EPA you could
445,450,"possibly imagine . She speaks very quickly , goes all around in circles ."
450,455,"And when she finishes , no idea what to buy ."
455,460,"So I turn to the girl behind the counter . Now , the girl behind the"
460,465,"counter , I heard her before , her English level is very low . But when I walk over to her ,"
465,470,"this girl , there 's no fear . In fact , she 's just looking at"
470,475,"me . You know that look ? Like ... Yeah ? Okay ... So , how ? Yeah , I"
475,480,"'ve been in Malaysia a long time . So , I go up to her"
480,485,"and I explain the problem , EPA and DHA . She looks at me , she says , """
485,490,"Okay , yeah . "" "" Ah , EPA for"
490,495,"heart . "" "" DHA for brain . """
495,500,""" Your heart okay or not ? """
500,505,"So I said , "" Yeah , yeah , "" I said , "" my heart is really ,"
505,510,"I think it 's pretty good . "" She says , """
510,515,"Your brain okay or not ? "" I said , "" No . No ,"
515,520,"my brain is not as good as it used to be . "" She looks and says ,"
520,525,""" Okay lah , you take Omega DHA ! """
525,530,"Problem solved , right ? So we 've got two different kinds of communicators . We 've got the one"
530,535,"who 's got a high level , but totally focused on herself and getting it right ,"
535,540,"and therefore , very ineffective . We 've got another one ,"
540,545,"low - level , totally focused on the person she 's talking to and getting a"
545,550,result . Effective . And therein lies the difference .
550,555,"Now , why is this distinction so important not just to you , to your"
555,560,"children , but to the future of Malaysia and countries like Malaysia ? And to"
560,565,"answer that , let 's take a look at who actually is speaking English in the"
565,570,"world today , okay ? So , if we looked at all of the English conversations"
570,575,"in the whole world , taking place right now on planet Earth , we"
575,580,"would see that for every native speaker , like me , there"
580,585,are five non - native speakers . And if we 'd
585,590,"listen to every conversation in English on planet Earth right now ,"
590,595,we would notice that 96 % of those conversations
595,600,involved non - native English speakers - only 4 % of those
600,605,conversations are native speaker to native speaker . This is not my language
605,610,"anymore , this language belongs to you . It 's not an art to be"
610,615,mastered ; it 's just a tool to use to get a result . And I want
615,620,"to give you a real - life example of what English is today in the world , real"
620,625,English today . This is another true story . I was at a
625,630,"barbecue a little while ago - this was a barbecue for engineers , engineers from"
630,635,all over the world . And they were making hot dogs . Some of the hot dogs
635,640,"were regular hot dogs , and some were these cheese hot dogs , you know , with the cheese in"
640,645,"the middle . A French engineer is cooking the hot dogs , and he turns to this"
645,650,"Korean engineer , and he says , "" Would you like a hot"
650,655,"dog ? "" And the Korean guy says , "" Yes , please ! "" He says , "" Do"
655,660,"you want the cheese ? "" And the Korean guy looks around at the table , he"
660,665,"says , "" I no see cheese . "" The French guy"
665,670,"says , "" The hot dog is contains the cheese . """
670,675,"The Korean guy does n't understand him , right ? So the French engineer tries"
675,680,"again . "" The hot dog is ... making from ..."
680,685,"with the cheese . "" Korean guy still does n't understand . He"
685,690,"tries again , he says , "" The hotdog is coming"
690,695,"from - No , the cheese is coming from the hot dog . "" Korean guy can not"
695,700,"understand . Now there 's a Japanese engineer who 's been listening to this conversation , turns"
700,705,"to the Korean engineer and he says , "" Ah ! Cheese ..."
705,710,"integrator ! "" He understands , okay ."
710,715,"Everybody understands . So , this is what English is today . It 's just a tool"
715,720,"to play around with to get a result , like a computer game ."
720,725,"Now , the challenge is that we know in schools"
725,730,"all around the world , English is not really being taught like it 's a tool"
730,735,to play with . It 's still being taught like it 's an art to master . And
735,740,students are judged more on correctness than on clarity .
740,745,Some of you might remember the
745,750,old comprehension exam in school . Does everybody remember in school when you 'd
750,755,"get a question about a text that you read , you 'd have to read through some text ,"
755,760,right ? And then answer a question to show that you understood the text ?
760,765,And this may have happened to you that you showed you understood
765,770,"the text , but you got a big X because you made a little grammar mistake ."
770,775,Like this student . This student clearly understood paragraph
775,780,"four . But no , not correct ! Because he left the letter N off"
780,785,"the word "" environment . "" But in the real world , what would matter ?"
785,790,"In the real world , what would matter is did you understand the email , or did you understand"
790,795,your customer so that you can go ahead and take action ?
795,800,"Now , the problem that I see here , over and over , is that"
800,805,"people take the attitude they developed about English in school , and they"
805,810,bring it into their adult life and into their work .
810,815,"And if you 're in a stressful situation , and you 're having a conversation , and you 're"
815,820,"trying to give a result to someone and say it correctly , your brain"
820,825,"multi - tasks , it can not do two things at once . And what I see is the brain just"
825,830,shutting down . And you may recognize these three symptoms of the brain shutting
830,835,down . The first one is that your listening
835,840,"goes . Someone is talking to you , and you 're so busy thinking about how you 're"
840,845,"going to respond and express yourself correctly , you do n't actually hear what"
845,850,the other person said . And I can see a lot of nodding in the audience .
850,855,"The second thing to go is your speaking . Your mind sort of shuts down , and"
855,860,"that vocabulary you do know just disappears , and the words do n't come out ."
860,865,The third thing to go is your confidence . The worst
865,870,thing about this is you may only be confident because you can not
870,875,"express yourself clearly , but to the person talking to you , they may"
875,880,"misunderstand this as a lack of confidence in your ability to do the job ,"
880,885,to perform . So if you want to speak
885,890,"English like Faizal with that great confidence , here 's the one thing"
890,895,"that you can do . When you speak , do n't focus on yourself ."
895,900,Focus on the other person and the result you want to achieve .
900,905,"Imagine a next generation of Malaysians , all with that"
905,910,"wonderful confidence in communication that Faizal has , at"
910,915,any level of English . Because let 's remember that English
915,920,"today is not an art to be mastered , it 's just a tool to use to"
920,925,get a result . And that tool belongs to you .
925,930,Thank you .
