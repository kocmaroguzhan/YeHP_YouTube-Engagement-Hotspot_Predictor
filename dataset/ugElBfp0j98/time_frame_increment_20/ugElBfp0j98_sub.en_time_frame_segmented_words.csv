So the killer noodle challenge is really just eating a level six . So today we 're gon na work our way up to six . We 're gon na be in two teams of three . And at any point we have to drop out . That team loses that member . A lot of our customers come in
80,100,"and go "" Is it really spicy ? "" Because a lot of cases when they say it 's spicy , it 's really not . But here we 're spicy and we mean it . So we each have waters here . Water is the only thing you 'd really supposed to be drinking . Unless you 're gon na tap out . So for all of our different styles of soup there 's actually two ways you can get it . With soup and without soup . Today we 're gon na be eating the without soups . Just to give you a heads up , It is"
100,120,gon na be a lot more spicy than with the soup . So Alexandria is going up against Keith . Zack is going up against Ned . And I 'm going up against YB . So whatever happens try to beat your partner . Level zero . So this is mild . So we have the Tokyo style no soup level zero . Just to give you guys a visualization of our
120,140,"numbing pepper . This is gon na be our sansho pepper right here . It 's gon na be before you ground it up and this is what it 's gon na look like when it goes into the soup . Wow . You got this peanuts , you got some scallions , you got some minced onion it looks like or maybe it 's minced garlic . Alright , number one restaurant item is actually the Tokyo style . It 's more of a creamy nutty taste because of that peanut butter flavor ."
140,160,"Cheers . Little cheers . Cheers , cheers . Oh yeah . Oh my goodness . That peanut butter is really good . Oh it 's incredible I love the peanut butter taste . And it 's thick noodles . I 've never had any noodle that has such a like peanutty sweetness to it . Yeah . And the noodles"
160,180,"itself are just perfect ratio . Perfectly cooked . You guys it reminds me of a Jajangmyeon . That Korean dish . YB you 're gon na flip over this . Did you say Jojo meow ? Yes , Jojo meow . Jojo meow . Thick and creamy . And the peanut butter really shines through . Really reminds me a lot of Jojo meow . So Jajangmyeon is a Korean - Chinese dish that"
180,200,has like a Black bean Black bean paste . And that black bean is to this pork mixed with the peanut butter . Gives it a similar like umami umptious flavor . Thick Pad Thai mix with ramen . Yeah . I like this but I am seeing why you need that spice . It 's missing the chili oil . This reminds me that there 's just a world of cuisines between Asian cuisines . There 's
200,220,Korean - Chinese food . and this is like kind of somewhere between Japanese and Chinese . When cultures meet they make beautiful food babies . Level one . Beautiful . Different color . It 's getting orangey . I already taste the spice just on the No
220,240,"way . On the chopstick . Yeah . So good . That 's delicious . Oh incredible . Okay . It brings it up . I see you chili oil . And on our spiciness side we do use cayenne pepper and some of our own homemade chili oil . That 's gon na be only up to level three . We actually have up until level six . Now , how do we get that high . It 's gon na be ghost pepper . Oh no ."
240,260,"Eugene , I know that your spice tolerance is impenetrable . Well , ghost peppers are tough for anybody . It 's more just me being Stubborn . Stubborn , yeah . I do think it need more spice . I agree . Even as a little spice baby myself . I know that the flavor will only get better with more chili oil . I have been eating a lot of spicy Chinese noodles in the last couple"
260,280,"years . So I think I can at least get in to the ghost pepper round . Level four . Four . The thing is I love the spice flavor but I got this weak Jewish belly . My people did not eat spice for many , many years . That 's why we 're bringing the Food Babies , YB and Alexandria to come join us . Mainly YB . I believe in you Alexandria . Alex can not handle spice . I"
280,300,"do n't do well . I think hot Cheetos are really hot . Oh geez . But I enjoy 'em I like spice but I ca n't handle it . What is she doing here ? Lady Keith , you 're lady Keith I jut wanted me included I just wanted me included . This is n't about friendship . The flavor and the spice I good but there 's no heat . Lots of flavor . The tiniest bit of heat . Zero heat . I can feel it in my throat . I usually eat a lot of spicy Korean food in general . But I"
300,320,do n't think I 'm technically good at spice . I think I 'm just better at hiding it . So hopefully I can make it ' til six . I maybe bad at Mukbangs but I really like spicy food . Even when it hurts me . You may remember me dousing wasabi in the sushi video . Level one is perfect . Everyone can be able to handle it . There 's zero spice for me in this . This is my
320,340,"ideal spice level . I ca n't handle anymore . This is your ideal spice level ? We 'll see how the rest goes ? You 're nuts . You are , you are . Ideal is like if I do n't have to take a sip of water between every bite then the next one might get me there . Level two . This one looks spicier . Some dusting . I see the dust now . I think I 'm gon na start feeling it here . I 'm trying into"
340,360,level four . Yeah . I 'm just being honest . I think you can do it . Well I know I 'm supposed to beat Keith . But I really wanna beat YB . Good luck . You are delusional . That 's my one goal . I appreciate you shooting for the moon but you 're gon na land in like Toledo . Here we go . Cheers . Cheers . Alright .
360,380,"I feel the heat on this one . Yeah . It 's still really good . You can like taste it before it even reaches your tongue . The flavor is starting to equal out between peanut butter and chili oil . I agree . Oh yeah , the numb . Here 's comes the numb . We do have a numbness and the spiciness side . The numbness comes from our sansho peppers . Do n't get that confused with sichuan pepper . It does create a very numbing effect"
380,400,but the key difference is that when you drink water it 's gon na have a much more citrusy after taste . Rather than kind of metallic after taste . Yes . We get with some of this . That sounds nice . Yeah . You have like a tingling on your tongue . I kind of taste the peppercorness through my nose . It 's more of how it breathes than how I taste it itself . I do taste the citrus a little bit . Oh it is
400,420,citrusy . Yeah . I ' trying to compare it to something that people can relate to . Numbing Just tingles . It 's like an epidural for your mouth . Alexandria has never had an epidural . You do n't know that . I will say that the nose blowing has begun . Uh oh . Oh yes . I 'm feeling good . I 'm starting to feel like
420,440,like I 've got some energy . Kinda like I have fiver hour energy or a Red Bull . This is where I would want to eat my dinner . I 'm feeling a nice thin layer of perspiration . A lingering heat . Where I feel like if I breath I can light a candle . It 's honestly about at the same spice as the Keith 's chicken sauce . And now we are
440,460,"going to level three which is the most popular spice level that 's ordered at this restaurant . Hey guys , I 've got level three right here . This gon na be our house standard level . House standard . House standard . Meaning if you ca n't handle this you 're weak . Oh wow . It smells more intense . I 'm really smelling the floral notes of the peppercorn now . I feel like we 're like pre - gaming . And we 're taking more and more shots and we 're"
460,480,"getting drunker It does feel like we 're gon na go out to a party where we have noodles later . By the time we get to the party we 'll be pretty bust . We 'll be spicied out . Ah so good . That 's spicy . Alright , this is the last round before ghost peppers . Let 's enjoy . Let 's enjoy this final moment . Let 's try to enjoy it . Cheers . In the eye of"
480,500,the hurricane . It 's still delicious . A lot of times spice reaches a place where you no longer can taste or feel . This still has tremendous flavor . My nose is starting to run a little bit . Which is great . I 've been a little congested . I feel like I 'm in an Uber right now
500,520,"going to a party and you know when you are kinda like tipsy and you 're talking a lot . How long have you lived in LA ? What part of LA are you in ? Oh cool yeah , I do n't know where that is . Yeah this makes me excited to talk to strangers . Got ta tell you right now , It taste the most delicious . It taste really good .

Yeah , you know when you 're like ingesting really spicy food . The ghost behind him . So very warm . My body 's getting warm ."
540,560,"Yeah , we 're getting some water works over here . Can I get a water works checked ? That was n't as bad as I thought it was gon na be . Easy buckets . Maybe I 'll beat YB . But I think after this is when it really takes off . Right ? Yeah , we 're about to enter ghost pepper town . Yeah , we 're ready for the next one . Alright guys , we got level four right here . This is"
560,580,"gon na be where our spicy challenge starts to begin . It 's from here that we started adding our ghost peppers . So be very careful . Oh wow . It 's smells . Smell it . Can you smell it ? Oh yeah , I can smell it . Oh wow . It 's gon na be a linear progression from zero to three . But from four , five and six it 's gon na be an exponential growth . So be ready . So it does it like this and then like that . Yeah , It"
580,600,just goes straight up . They say this is a religious experience . I can feel it in my temples . Okay should we do this ? Did you guys get it ? Oh I get it . I just got it . Did you get it Ned ? Oh yeah I got it earlier But you did n't laugh . But I did n't like it . Thank you . Cheers . Cheers . I might only get one bite here so I 'm just gon na go for it .

620,640,"painful , spicy and delicious . Why painful ? Well that pain really does release those endorphins . And that creates that euphoric effect , Right ? Okay , so we might experience euphoria today . You are . Zendaya , that 's where we 're gon na be at . Is is Zendaya ? I thought it 's Zandaya ? Zendaya ? I thought it was Zendaya ? Zendaya ? Zendaya ,"

I 'm sweating but it feels good like I 'm kinda turned on . Well of course , I think it 's fair to say we 're all kind of turned on . It 's like an Asian proverb . I do n't think it 's fair to say that ."
680,700,"You guys know the old Asian proverb that says like "" The most fun you can have outside the bedroom is the spice challenge . "" . That 's probably where I would stop . Yeah , this would be optimum spice level if I 'm like looking to have a good time . I feel like a pop star . You look crazy right now . What 's happening ?
