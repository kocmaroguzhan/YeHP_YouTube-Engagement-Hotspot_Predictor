21.345,23.952,Try Guys and Food Babies are here at Tsujita Killer Noodle.
23.952,25.922,On Sawtelle in Los Angeles.
25.922,27.788000000000004,To try the killer noodle challenge.
27.788,31.113000000000003,These are some of the spiciest noodles in LA.
31.113,32.73,Nay the country.
32.73,35.29899999999999,"We're gonna start out with level zero, quite not killer."
35.299,38.107,"And move our way all the way up to six, very killer."
38.107,40.412000000000006,So killer in fact it has ghost in it.
40.412,45.94500000000001,"So like every spice video on this channel, I can't wait for you to see YB and me eat all of it."
45.945,48.501999999999995,While the rest of them cry and fail.
48.502,50.123,Like cowards.
53.754,54.586999999999996,Hi my name is Peter.
54.587,56.25,And we're here at Killer Noodle Tsujita.
56.25,58.451999999999984,Are you guys excited to try a killer noodle challenge today?
58.452,59.719,Yeah.
59.719,60.552,So excited.
60.552,60.9685,Hell
60.9685,61.385,yeah.
61.385,68.43000000000002,The killer noodle was originally founded by Mr. Tsujita back in 2011 and from that success he wanted to bring some more concepts into the LA areas.
68.43,71.277,So the killer noodle challenge is really just eating a level six.
71.277,73.586,So today we're gonna work our way up to six.
73.586,75.56399999999996,We're gonna be in two teams of three.
75.564,77.03200000000001,And at any point we have to drop out.
77.032,78.60500000000002,That team loses that member.
78.605,81.417,"A lot of our customers come in and go ""Is it really spicy?"""
81.417,84.336,"Because a lot of cases when they say it's spicy, it's really not."
84.336,86.52899999999998,But here we're spicy and we mean it.
86.529,87.84899999999999,So we each have waters here.
87.849,90.499,Water is the only thing you'd really supposed to be drinking.
90.499,91.79900000000004,Unless you're gonna tap out.
91.799,95.32799999999997,So for all of our different styles of soup there's actually two ways you can get it.
95.328,96.62299999999999,With soup and without soup.
96.623,98.4669090909091,Today we're gonna be eating the without soups.
98.4669090909091,102.22299999999998,"Just to give you a heads up, It is gonna be a lot more spicy than with the soup."
104.699,106.891,So Alexandria is going up against Keith.
106.891,108.062,Zack is going up against Ned.
108.062,109.73200000000001,And I'm going up against YB.
109.732,112.475,So whatever happens try to beat your partner.
112.475,114.636,Level zero.
114.636,115.726,So this is mild.
115.726,118.14800000000001,So we have the Tokyo style no soup level zero.
118.148,120.727,Just to give you guys a visualization of our numbing pepper.
120.727,123.024,This is gonna be our sansho pepper right here.
123.024,127.51299999999998,It's gonna be before you ground it up and this is what it's gonna look like when it goes into the soup.
127.513,128.346,Wow.
128.346,133.043,"You got this peanuts, you got some scallions, you got some minced onion it looks like or maybe it's minced garlic."
133.043,136.005,"Alright, number one restaurant item is actually the Tokyo style."
136.005,139.47199999999998,It's more of a creamy nutty taste because of that peanut butter flavor.
139.472,140.357,Cheers.
140.357,141.19,Little cheers.
141.19,142.60700000000003,"Cheers, cheers."
147.929,148.812,Oh yeah.
148.812,149.645,Oh my goodness.
149.645,150.77200000000002,That peanut butter is really good.
150.772,151.64899999999997,Oh it's incredible
151.649,152.88899999999995,I love the peanut butter taste.
152.889,153.899,And it's thick noodles.
153.899,157.97699999999998,I've never had any noodle that has such a like peanutty sweetness to it.
157.977,158.81,Yeah.
158.81,161.974,And the noodles itself are just perfect ratio.
161.974,162.949,Perfectly cooked.
162.949,164.80499999999998,You guys it reminds me of a Jajangmyeon.
164.805,165.72699999999998,That Korean dish.
165.727,166.97799999999998,YB you're gonna flip over this.
166.978,169.05300000000005,Did you say Jojo meow?
169.053,170.82800000000003,"Yes, Jojo meow."
170.828,171.878,Jojo meow.
171.878,172.711,Thick and creamy.
172.711,174.06700000000006,And the peanut butter really shines through.
174.067,177.15,Really reminds me a lot of Jojo meow.
177.995,182.37900000000002,So Jajangmyeon is a Korean-Chinese dish that has like a Black bean Black bean paste.
182.379,184.878,And that black bean is to this pork mixed with the peanut butter.
184.878,187.804,Gives it a similar like umami umptious flavor.
187.804,189.944,Thick Pad Thai mix with ramen.
189.944,190.777,Yeah.
190.777,191.4322857142857,I like this
191.4322857142857,193.66799999999998,but I am seeing why you need that spice.
193.668,194.774,It's missing the chili oil.
194.774,199.345,This reminds me that there's just a world of cuisines between Asian cuisines.
199.345,201.52299999999997,There's Korean-Chinese food.
201.523,203.81200000000004,and this is like kind of somewhere between Japanese and Chinese.
203.812,206.632,When cultures meet they make beautiful food babies.
212.1,213.767,Level one.
214.99,215.823,Beautiful.
215.823,216.656,Different color.
216.656,217.98200000000003,It's getting orangey.
217.982,220.481,I already taste the spice just on the No way.
220.481,222.2698888888889,On the chopstick.
222.2698888888889,222.781,Yeah.
222.781,223.614,So good.
223.614,224.447,That's delicious.
224.447,225.28,Oh incredible.
225.28,226.113,Okay.
226.113,226.94600000000003,It brings it up.
226.946,228.21900000000002,I see you chili oil.
228.219,232.802,And on our spiciness side we do use cayenne pepper and some of our own homemade chili oil.
232.802,234.45800000000003,That's gonna be only up to level three.
234.458,236.16999999999996,We actually have up until level six.
236.17,237.397,"Now, how do we get that high."
237.397,238.71700000000004,It's gonna be ghost pepper.
238.717,239.55,Oh no.
240.771,243.41,"Eugene, I know that your spice tolerance is impenetrable."
243.41,245.902,"Well, ghost peppers are tough for anybody."
245.902,248.198,It's more just me being Stubborn.
248.198,249.205,"Stubborn, yeah."
249.205,250.69899999999998,I do think it need more spice.
250.699,251.532,I agree.
251.532,253.01100000000002,Even as a little spice baby myself.
253.011,256.684,I know that the flavor will only get better with more chili oil.
256.684,260.261,I have been eating a lot of spicy Chinese noodles in the last couple years.
260.261,263.35600000000005,So I think I can at least get in to the ghost pepper round.
263.356,264.189,Level four.
264.189,265.022,Four.
265.022,268.231,The thing is I love the spice flavor but I got this weak Jewish belly.
268.231,270.7629999999999,"My people did not eat spice for many, many years."
270.763,274.716,"That's why we're bringing the Food Babies, YB and Alexandria to come join us."
274.716,275.828,Mainly YB.
275.828,278.35600000000005,I believe in you Alexandria.
278.356,279.86000000000007,Alex can not handle spice.
279.86,280.6929999999999,I don't do well.
280.693,282.103,I think hot Cheetos are really hot.
282.103,282.936,Oh geez.
282.936,283.769,But I enjoy 'em
283.769,284.1186296296296,I like spice
284.1186296296296,284.7129999999999,but I can't handle it.
284.713,285.688,What is she doing here?
285.688,290.00399999999996,"Lady Keith, you're lady Keith I jut wanted me included I just wanted me included."
290.004,291.541,This isn't about friendship.
291.541,292.650756097561,The flavor and the spice I good
292.650756097561,293.361,but there's no heat.
293.361,294.1940000000001,Lots of flavor.
294.194,295.373,The tiniest bit of heat.
295.373,295.849,Zero heat.
295.849,297.039,I can feel it in my throat.
297.039,299.63999999999993,I usually eat a lot of spicy Korean food in general.
299.64,302.444,But I don't think I'm technically good at spice.
302.444,304.24300000000017,I think I'm just better at hiding it.
304.243,306.34899999999993,So hopefully I can make it 'til six.
306.349,307.75154545454546,I maybe bad at Mukbangs
307.75154545454546,309.81299999999993,but I really like spicy food.
309.813,311.723,Even when it hurts me.
311.723,315.7149999999999,You may remember me dousing wasabi in the sushi video.
315.715,316.4119999999999,Level one is perfect.
316.4119999999999,317.5189999999999,Everyone can be able to handle it.
317.519,319.3299999999999,There's zero spice for me in this.
319.33,320.54499999999996,This is my ideal spice level.
320.545,321.554,I can't handle anymore.
321.554,322.44399999999996,This is your ideal spice level?
322.444,323.589375,We'll see how the rest goes?
323.589375,324.11,You're nuts.
324.11,325.32799999999986,"You are, you are."
325.328,330.6499999999999,Ideal is like if I don't have to take a sip of water between every bite then the next one might get me there.
330.65,332.233,Level two.
334.184,335.134,This one looks spicier.
335.134,335.967,Some dusting.
335.967,337.304,I see the dust now.
337.304,338.96200000000005,I think I'm gonna start feeling it here.
338.962,340.3879999999999,I'm trying into level four.
340.388,341.221,Yeah.
341.221,342.05400000000003,I'm just being honest.
342.054,342.914,I think you can do it.
342.914,343.74700000000007,Well I know I'm supposed to beat Keith.
343.747,344.77299999999997,But I really wanna beat YB.
344.773,346.39199999999994,Good luck.
346.392,347.321,You are delusional.
347.321,348.56399999999996,That's my one goal.
348.564,352.9920000000001,I appreciate you shooting for the moon but you're gonna land in like Toledo.
352.992,353.88,Here we go.
353.88,354.713,Cheers.
354.713,355.546,Cheers.
355.546,356.379,Alright.
360.516,361.83900000000006,I feel the heat on this one.
361.839,362.672,Yeah.
362.672,363.50500000000005,It's still really good.
363.505,366.19499999999994,You can like taste it before it even reaches your tongue.
366.195,369.78199999999987,The flavor is starting to equal out between peanut butter and chili oil.
369.782,370.615,I agree.
370.615,371.44800000000004,"Oh yeah, the numb."
371.448,372.281,Here's comes the numb.
372.281,374.85900000000004,We do have a numbness and the spiciness side.
374.859,376.548,The numbness comes from our sansho peppers.
376.548,377.77700000000004,Don't get that confused with sichuan pepper.
377.777,385.033,It does create a very numbing effect but the key difference is that when you drink water it's gonna have a much more citrusy after taste.
385.033,387.408,Rather than kind of metallic after taste.
387.408,387.6351818181818,Yes.
387.6351818181818,389.07400000000007,We get with some of this.
389.074,389.907,That sounds nice.
389.907,390.74,Yeah.
390.74,391.71299999999997,You have like a tingling on your tongue.
391.713,394.5840000000001,I kind of taste the peppercorness through my nose.
394.584,397.577,It's more of how it breathes than how I taste it itself.
397.577,399.22600000000006,I do taste the citrus a little bit.
399.226,400.386,Oh it is citrusy.
400.386,401.219,Yeah.
401.219,402.885,I' trying to compare it to something that people can relate to.
402.885,404.551,Numbing Just tingles.
404.551,405.675,It's like an epidural for your mouth.
405.675,408.18199999999996,Alexandria has never had an epidural.
408.182,409.3689999999999,You don't know that.
412.396,415.723,I will say that the nose blowing has begun.
415.723,416.556,Uh oh.
416.556,417.389,Oh yes.
417.389,418.701,I'm feeling good.
418.701,421.559,I'm starting to feel like like I've got some energy.
421.559,424.684,Kinda like I have fiver hour energy or a Red Bull.
424.684,427.90800000000013,This is where I would want to eat my dinner.
427.908,431.382,I'm feeling a nice thin layer of perspiration.
431.382,433.187,A lingering heat.
433.187,435.942,Where I feel like if I breath I can light a candle.
435.942,439.468,It's honestly about at the same spice as the Keith's chicken sauce.
439.468,444.83099999999996,And now we are going to level three which is the most popular spice level that's ordered at this restaurant.
444.831,446.389,"Hey guys, I've got level three right here."
446.389,448.21199999999993,This gonna be our house standard level.
448.212,449.161,House standard.
449.161,449.994,House standard.
449.994,451.66,Meaning if you can't handle this you're weak.
451.66,451.841875,Oh wow.
451.841875,452.53299999999996,It smells more intense.
452.533,456.062,I'm really smelling the floral notes of the peppercorn now.
456.062,457.331,I feel like we're like pre-gaming.
457.331,462.739,And we're taking more and more shots and we're getting drunker It does feel like we're gonna go out to a party where we have noodles later.
462.739,466.12300000000016,By the time we get to the party we'll be pretty bust.
466.123,468.97900000000004,We'll be spicied out.
468.979,470.084,Ah so good.
470.084,471.475,That's spicy.
471.475,474.136,"Alright, this is the last round before ghost peppers."
474.136,475.1,Let's enjoy.
475.1,476.249,Let's enjoy this final moment.
476.249,478.00699999999995,Let's try to enjoy it.
478.007,478.84,Cheers.
478.84,481.3399999999999,In the eye of the hurricane.
486.511,487.562,It's still delicious.
487.562,493.284,A lot of times spice reaches a place where you no longer can taste or feel.
493.284,494.957,This still has tremendous flavor.
494.957,496.37799999999993,My nose is starting to run a little bit.
496.378,497.211,Which is great.
497.211,498.20900000000006,I've been a little congested.
498.209,502.956,I feel like I'm in an Uber right now going to a party and you know when you are kinda like tipsy
502.956,503.78900000000004,and you're talking a lot.
503.789,504.62200000000007,How long have you lived in LA?
504.622,505.556,What part of LA are you in?
505.556,505.9278064516129,Oh cool
505.9278064516129,507.4770000000001,"yeah, I don't know where that is."
507.477,511.156,Yeah this makes me excited to talk to strangers.
511.156,513.556,"Gotta tell you right now, It taste the most delicious."
513.556,514.722,It taste really good.
514.722,517.5399999999997,"I'm starting to feel a little bit of the a little bit of the ""Hey."""
517.54,520.337,"I'm starting to be ""Woo"" over here."
520.337,521.8099999999998,Starting to sweat a little bit.
521.81,523.209,"Starting to sweat, feeling good."
523.209,526.026,I feel a bit of heat building in my body.
526.026,527.1004,Behind my skin
527.1004,528.202,but I don't feel my mouth.
528.202,529.1750000000001,Behind your skin?
529.175,532.3720000000001,"Yeah, you know when you're like ingesting really spicy food."
532.372,533.561,The ghost behind him.
536.534,537.4739999999999,So very warm.
537.474,539.391,My body's getting warm.
540.338,542.769,"Yeah, we're getting some water works over here."
542.769,545.9819999999999,Can I get a water works checked?
545.982,547.814,That wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be.
547.814,548.647,Easy buckets.
548.647,550.557,Maybe I'll beat YB.
550.557,552.3299999999999,But I think after this is when it really takes off.
552.33,553.163,Right?
553.163,554.3620000000001,"Yeah, we're about to enter ghost pepper town."
556.293,557.2820000000002,"Yeah, we're ready for the next one."
557.282,559.4700000000003,"Alright guys, we got level four right here."
559.47,562.5270000000002,This is gonna be where our spicy challenge starts to begin.
562.527,565.0269999999999,It's from here that we started adding our ghost peppers.
565.027,565.926,So be very careful.
565.926,566.2256666666667,Oh wow.
566.2256666666667,566.825,It's smells.
566.825,567.658,Smell it.
567.658,568.3799333333334,Can you smell it?
568.3799333333334,569.3240000000001,"Oh yeah, I can smell it."
569.324,570.157,Oh wow.
570.157,572.813,It's gonna be a linear progression from zero to three.
572.813,575.3069999999999,"But from four, five and six it's gonna be an exponential growth."
575.307,577.088,So be ready.
577.088,578.3714545454546,So it does it like this
578.3714545454546,579.441,and then like that.
579.441,580.87,"Yeah, It just goes straight up."
580.87,582.537,They say this is a religious experience.
582.537,584.1519999999999,I can feel it in my temples.
584.152,585.434,Okay should we do this?
585.434,586.9840000000002,Did you guys get it?
586.984,587.9440000000001,Oh I get it.
587.944,589.111,I just got it.
589.948,590.6163333333332,Did you get it
590.6163333333332,590.7986060606058,Ned?
590.7986060606058,591.1631515151513,Oh yeah
591.1631515151513,591.9529999999996,I got it earlier
591.953,592.8769999999997,But you didn't laugh.
592.877,593.812,But I didn't like it.
593.812,595.075,Thank you.
595.075,595.908,Cheers.
595.908,596.741,Cheers.
596.741,598.6369999999997,I might only get one bite here so I'm just gonna go for it.
603.414,604.381,Whoa.
604.381,605.776,Oh yeah.
605.776,606.616,Oh yeah.
606.616,607.6660000000002,There she is.
607.666,609.249,"Okay, I taste it."
613.71,614.543,Oh wow.
614.543,615.376,Oh.
617.953,618.8719999999998,This got shivers.
618.872,621.909,"You described your food as painful, spicy and delicious."
621.909,623.229,Why painful?
623.229,626.32,Well that pain really does release those endorphins.
626.32,628.96,"And that creates that euphoric effect, Right?"
628.96,631.508,"Okay, so we might experience euphoria today."
631.508,632.3410000000001,You are.
632.341,634.2489999999998,"Zendaya, that's where we're gonna be at."
634.249,634.8939666666666,Is is Zendaya?
634.8939666666666,636.0079999999999,I thought it's Zandaya?
636.008,636.439925925926,Zendaya?
636.439925925926,637.6740000000002,I thought it was Zendaya?
637.674,638.54,Zendaya?
638.54,640.129,"Zendaya, right?"
640.129,641.0720000000001,"It's Zendaya, right?"
641.072,642.249,From the big foot movie?
642.249,645.969,I see like I see like the end of Zendaya's dress.
645.969,647.5409999999999,Like I see her turning a corner.
647.541,650.5449999999997,This is when it's hard to breath out.
650.545,652.0620000000001,"It's not like just ""Oh that's hot.""."
652.062,653.162,"It's like ""Oh it hurts.""."
653.162,654.168,But I do want more.
654.168,655.433,It's really good.
655.433,657.5090000000001,Oh my god this is sending me places.
657.509,658.946,Wow this is a trip.
658.946,660.2659999999998,And it lingers a lot.
660.266,661.099,It's not going away.
661.099,662.1469999999999,It's like in my gums.
662.147,663.8570000000001,Oh the water taste crazy.
663.8570000000001,668.3070000000001,My tongue is like vibrating from the water.
668.307,669.1400000000001,I'm sweaty.
669.14,670.279,You're sweaty.
670.279,670.8217931034483,I'm sweating
670.8217931034483,673.377,but it feels good like I'm kinda turned on.
675.09,676.867,"Well of course, I think it's fair to say we're all kind of turned on."
676.867,677.6999999999999,It's like an Asian proverb.
677.7,679.917,I don't think it's fair to say that.
679.917,684.9380000000001,"You guys know the old Asian proverb that says like "" The most fun you can have outside the bedroom is the spice challenge."
684.938,686.844,That's probably where I would stop.
686.844,689.8979999999999,"Yeah, this would be optimum spice level if I'm like looking to have a good time."
689.898,690.8789999999999,I feel like a pop star.
690.879,691.8309999999998,You look crazy right now.
691.8309999999998,692.5449999999997,What's happening?
692.545,694.882,I feel like a pop star who's taking her solo.
694.882,699.7469999999998,I wanna feel like what You're starting to cry.
699.747,701.669,I wanna feel what five feels like
701.669,704.115,but I don't think I can go past five.
704.115,705.8410000000001,Even now my mouth is hot.
705.841,707.494,I feel like very euphoric.
707.494,709.3830000000002,"I feel like Hey, let's go to a party."
709.383,710.503,Which party should we go to?
710.503,711.3360000000001,I don't know.
711.336,712.1689999999999,Let's talk about it.
712.169,713.002,Let's think about.
713.002,713.5943555555556,Let's talk about it.
713.5943555555556,715.6719999999999,What's really cute for me right now is I have simultaneous tears.
715.672,717.9440000000001,And they're like at the same place in each eye.
717.944,719.337,"They're like ""Yes.""."
719.337,720.46,Let's move up.
720.46,721.293,Really?
721.293,722.1259999999999,Let's go.
722.126,722.959,Ready?
722.959,724.367,Let's go for it.
724.367,725.625,Level five.
725.625,726.945,Level five.
726.945,729.011,So I got level five right here for you guys.
729.011,732.879,"As you can see, It's gonna be a lot more of a dense red color."
732.879,734.1039999999999,All that peppering is the sansho.
734.104,735.1980000000001,It's the sansho and the ghost pepper.
735.198,736.031,Wow.
737.36,738.299,Fantastic.
738.299,741.6209999999999,I gotta say I'm starting to get a little nervous about this one.
741.621,744.403,If that one's a four and this one's a five.
744.403,747.3630000000002,And they said it gets exponentially crazier.
747.363,748.673,Oh that's true.
748.673,752.097,This one you can actually smell the spice wafting off of this dish.
752.097,753.4269999999999,Which is incredible.
753.427,754.26,Cheers.
754.26,755.093,Cheers.
755.093,755.926,Clingky-clingk.
755.926,756.759,Cheers.
757.984,759.0319999999999,Here we go.
771.605,772.4379999999999,Oh my god.
775.984,776.9589999999998,Oh my god.
778.313,779.685,Oh yeah.
779.685,783.102,There's a deep under current in this one.
784.558,786.1030000000001,We got a round house kick.
786.103,790.2740000000001,A tongue slap and then You're getting a little moist on the face.
790.274,791.172,Yeah.
791.172,792.8809999999999,I'm feeling it.
792.881,793.724,It's good.
793.724,794.9670000000001,It's tasty.
794.967,796.3269999999998,Oh that's real good spice.
796.327,797.5929999999998,Oh my god.
797.593,799.53,Freaking good.
799.53,801.1090000000002,The taste is still very good.
801.109,803.0169999999999,Yeah it's a different experience now.
803.017,804.4339999999999,It's painful now.
805.958,807.796,Swirling around.
807.796,810.8340000000002,You know those spinners that you put the salad in and you press the button.
810.834,812.6699999999997,Feels like someone is doing that to my brain.
812.67,813.503,Salad spinner.
813.503,814.336,Salad spinner?
814.336,815.1690000000001,That's what they call it?
815.169,816.002,How 'bout that?
816.002,817.2169999999999,What a straight forward name.
819.594,821.381,I'm ascending.
821.381,823.0069999999998,I'm a ghost.
823.007,824.074,"Oh wow, oh wow."
824.074,825.324,Are you okay?
835.329,837.7759999999998,His face is so close to me.
837.776,839.5610000000001,"That's like the right type of painful, you know?"
839.561,840.394,No.
841.448,842.533,You're wet.
843.53,846.962,"There's an old Asian proverb that says ""You're food isn't good if you're not sweating buckets."
846.962,849.577,"There's an old Jewish proverb that goes ""Oy.""."
853.38,853.674,That's
853.674,855.046,"yeah, I'm gonna have to tap out here."
857.505,858.4219999999999,Proud of you Keith.
858.422,859.71,I want a popsicle please.
862.965,863.7980000000002,Cool down that brain fire.
863.798,864.764,Yeah.
864.764,867.1620000000001,It's so good though wish I could eat more.
867.162,868.3030000000001,It is really good.
868.303,870.163,I want to keep going.
870.163,874.529,I fear that it is personally irresponsible and reckless for me to even attempt another bite.
875.362,876.6260000000001,I can't believe I made it this far.
876.626,878.9039999999999,This is spectacular but this is all I can handle.
878.904,879.757,Wow.
879.757,882.47,The heats starting to travel to the outside of my mouth.
882.47,883.3029999999999,Like on my face.
883.303,884.1360000000001,Are you okay?
884.136,885.3800000000002,I think I got the noodles on my face.
885.38,885.5949677419354,Oh no.
885.5949677419354,887.0459999999999,I'm very proud of you Alexandria.
887.046,892.1069999999999,"I'm like truly wildly impress with how well you are doing Thank you, just gotta beat YB."
893.361,894.833,Oh yeah.
894.833,895.666,Are you guys gonna go to six?
895.666,896.4990000000003,You gonna go for it?
896.499,897.332,"Oh yeah, let's go."
897.332,898.973,Let's do this.
898.973,899.806,Aw.
900.775,901.6079999999997,"Alright guys, got the level six right here."
901.608,905.2999999999996,As you can see it's gonna be a much more black color.
905.3,907.7179999999998,The hottest level they have on the menu.
907.718,913.3590000000003,"And we are going to try to finish our full bowl of level six, otherwise you tap out."
913.359,916.153,And I brought some ghost peppers just in case you wanna do it.
916.153,917.028,Wow.
917.028,917.861,Wow.
917.861,919.085,Yes.
919.085,920.708,'Bout to off-road it.
920.708,921.8370000000001,My scalp is sweating.
921.837,924.8709111111112,You know when you work out and just your head is really wet.
924.8709111111112,926.0330000000001,That's where I am right now.
926.033,927.131724137931,"Wow, look at that."
927.131724137931,928.4839999999999,That looks so scary.
928.484,931.8220000000002,"Alexandria, someone who has failed almost exclusively for the past six years."
931.822,933.7529999999998,You can still get really far in life.
933.753,939.117,"I own a company, I make videos, I'm arguably equally as popular as the other guys."
939.117,939.95,You know?
939.95,941.6169999999998,You could fail all the way to the top.
941.617,942.45,I do agree.
942.45,943.528,This is the one thing I needed to do.
943.528,944.5290000000001,And then I'm quitting my job.
947.177,948.01,Cheers.
948.01,948.843,Cheers.
948.843,949.676,Cheers.
953.635,955.6350000000001,Keep going Don't give up.
961.396,962.229,Whoa.
966.004,966.9709999999999,Oh my god.
966.971,967.804,Oh yeah.
970.886,972.1080000000001,Do not get this on a date.
977.603,980.6947872340427,This is the first one I actually feel the spice go down my esophagus.
980.6947872340427,983.7640000000001,The way I'm gonna beat YB is I'm only having water.
985.416,987.4179999999999,"It's got a kick to it, you know?"
987.418,990.312,I feel like I just went to a dentist they numbed my tongue.
990.312,992.5029999999999,"Oh yeah, my mouth is just drooling."
992.503,992.7806666666667,Same.
992.7806666666667,993.2665833333333,Let's go.

994.169,995.0169999999999,You got this girl.
995.017,996.326,Don't give up now.
996.326,999.9699999999999,I will say you aren't the waterfall that Eugene is right now.
999.97,1000.934,That is so
1000.934,1001.7670000000002,Oh my god.
1001.767,1002.684,So spicy.
1003.898,1006.736,"It's like that ""Key and Peele"" episode we're his just sweating balls."
1006.736,1009.6499999999999,So spicy but it makes me feel so good.
1009.65,1012.636,You should open up early on Sunday and call it Sunday service.
1012.636,1014.0209999999998,And let people see God.
1014.021,1015.677,Oh boy.
1015.677,1017.5169999999999,My tongue is made up of metal.
1017.517,1018.6000000000001,"Clang, clang."
1020.604,1023.009,This like swallowing fire and hell.
1023.009,1026.83,It's literally like lava is going down my belly.
1027.982,1032.283,I feel like I'm seeing a whole another level of spirituality
1032.283,1034.5990000000004,"Oh no , don't wipe your eyes."
1034.599,1035.851,Well.
1035.851,1037.112,Starting to get full.
1037.112,1037.9450000000002,I'm full too.
1037.945,1038.794,I'm really full.
1038.794,1039.6270000000002,I'm not full.
1039.627,1041.2930000000001,"See, I wish I wish you had my stomach"
1041.293,1042.1259999999997,and I have your mouth.
1042.126,1042.3639999999998,Oh no.
1042.3639999999998,1045.542,"now we would just be both be it, it would be mixed up."
1046.985,1049.7300000000005,"I'm really, really, not doing good."
1049.73,1052.251,I'm debating whether to finish or not.
1052.251,1054.0519999999997,I don't know if I can.
1054.052,1054.9699999999998,I'm officially tapping out.
1057.992,1059.436,As Zack advised I'm gonna quit.
1059.436,1060.5839999999998,I think I did pretty good.
1060.584,1061.4170000000001,You did well.
1061.417,1062.547,You've been amazing.
1062.547,1063.6829999999998,I can't anymore.
1063.683,1064.516,"Wow, way to go."
1064.516,1065.349,Way to go Alexandria.
1065.349,1069.8770000000002,I will say what is limiting me right now is my stomach volume.
1069.877,1074.02,So I am going to take a pinch of the ghost pepper.
1074.02,1074.899,What?
1074.899,1075.732,And count...
1076.565,1077.81,"No, Ned."
1077.81,1080.736,I'm making my own challenge YB.
1080.736,1081.7840000000003,Ned loves bad ideas.
1081.784,1083.953,Don't use your fingers.
1083.953,1085.6740000000002,Oh my god.
1085.674,1086.2293333333332,"Yes, yes"
1086.2293333333332,1086.5069999999998,Ned.
1086.507,1087.7230000000004,Don't back down now.
1090.249,1091.216,Oh my god.
1097.669,1099.169,What do you see?
1103.641,1105.2639999999997,I wanna get further away.
1106.574,1107.878,Euphoria!
1110.616,1114.804,I feel like I'm looking through a kaleidoscope right now.
1114.804,1118.284,My entire vision is just doing this.
1118.284,1119.601,"Click, click."
1121.226,1123.559,I'll have what I'm having.
1124.44,1125.362,Are you gonna finish it?
1125.362,1126.0968611111111,I have to beat YB.
1126.0968611111111,1128.4420000000002,Don't know if she's gonna be at the same place as me.
1128.442,1129.0026341463417,I just died.
1129.0026341463417,1132.042,But if I finish this that means YB has to finish the whole bowl.
1132.042,1133.5730000000003,You can do it YB.
1133.573,1135.141,We believe in you.
1135.141,1136.205,"Wow, wow."
1136.205,1138.1370000000002,"You're a hero, you're a hero."
1138.137,1139.5010000000002,Show us what you got.
1139.501,1141.809,"YB, this is for you."
1141.809,1144.091,"Go Eugene, go."
1147.391,1148.224,I'm done.
1148.224,1149.057,Okay.
1149.057,1149.8899999999999,There's no more noodles.
1149.89,1150.723,Alright.
1151.923,1153.582,"Look at him, look at him."
1153.582,1157.042,"Eugene, YB and Ned all surpassed all expectations."
1157.042,1160.912,Ned did exactly what we thought he'd do though with making a terrible decision.
1161.89,1167.367,I don't like I just run a marathon and made love at the same time.
1167.367,1168.8199375000002,Like I need cigarette
1168.8199375000002,1169.9500000000003,and I don't smoke.
1169.95,1171.3159999999998,"Well, I'm proud of us."
1171.316,1174.1030000000003,All of us got passed level five.
1174.103,1175.016,Yeah.
1175.016,1176.7480000000003,Zendaya is me.
1176.748,1179.1509999999998,And you have reached chi.

1184.434,1188.06,"It truly is painful, delicious, and spicy."
1195.55,1196.913,That is equilibrium.
1196.913,1198.2659999999998,Everything is Math.
1198.266,1200.0229999999997,A perfect amount of both spices.
1200.023,1202.0820000000003,"The stinging spice, the numbing spice."
1202.082,1202.915,Ah.
