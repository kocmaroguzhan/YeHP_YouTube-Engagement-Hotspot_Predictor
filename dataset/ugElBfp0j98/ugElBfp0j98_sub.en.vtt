00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.799
- [Eugene] The hottest
level they have on the menu

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:04.319
(intense music playing)

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.152
- [Alexandria] Oh my God

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:05.985
- Oh Yeah.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:06.818
(Zack screams)

00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:07.651
- Yes.

00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:08.984
(Ned laughing)

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:11.024
(Keith laughing)

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:13.012
- [Peter] Pain really does
release those endorphins

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.317
- Euphoria!

00:00:14.317 --> 00:00:17.567
(upbeat music playing)

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:22.680
- Try Guys and Food Babies are here at

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.952
Tsujita Killer Noodle.

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:25.922
On Sawtelle in Los Angeles.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.788
To try the killer noodle challenge.

00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:31.113
- [Eugene] These are some of
the spiciest noodles in LA.

00:00:31.113 --> 00:00:32.730
Nay the country.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.563
- [Keith] We're gonna start out with

00:00:33.563 --> 00:00:35.299
level zero, quite not killer.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:36.221
And move our way all the

00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:38.107
way up to six, very killer.

00:00:38.107 --> 00:00:40.412
So killer in fact it has ghost in it.

00:00:40.412 --> 00:00:42.441
- So like every spice
video on this channel,

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:45.003
I can't wait for you to see YB and me eat

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:45.945
all of it.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.502
While the rest of them cry and fail.

00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:50.123
Like cowards.

00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:53.754
(pop music playing)

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:54.587
- [Peter] Hi my name is Peter.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.250
And we're here at Killer Noodle Tsujita.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.452
Are you guys excited to try a
killer noodle challenge today?

00:00:58.452 --> 00:00:59.719
- [Try Guys] Yeah.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.552
- So excited.

00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:01.385
- Hell yeah.

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:02.218
- [Peter] The killer noodle was originally

00:01:02.218 --> 00:01:03.610
founded by Mr. Tsujita back in

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.127
2011 and from that success he wanted to

00:01:06.127 --> 00:01:08.430
bring some more concepts
into the LA areas.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.181
So the killer noodle
challenge is really just

00:01:10.181 --> 00:01:11.277
eating a level six.

00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:12.634
- [Keith] So today we're gonna work our

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:13.586
way up to six.

00:01:13.586 --> 00:01:15.564
We're gonna be in two teams of three.

00:01:15.564 --> 00:01:17.032
And at any point we have to drop out.

00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:18.605
That team loses that member.

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:19.966
- A lot of our customers come in

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.417
and go "Is it really spicy?"

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:22.420
Because a lot of cases

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.298
when they say it's spicy,

00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:24.336
it's really not.

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:26.529
But here we're spicy and we mean it.

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:27.849
- So we each have waters here.

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:29.213
Water is the only thing you'd really

00:01:29.213 --> 00:01:30.499
supposed to be drinking.

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:31.799
Unless you're gonna tap out.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.096
- [Peter] So for all of
our different styles of

00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:35.328
soup there's actually
two ways you can get it.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:36.623
With soup and without soup.

00:01:36.623 --> 00:01:37.808
Today we're gonna be eating the

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:39.620
without soups. Just to
give you a heads up,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.708
It is gonna be a lot more

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:42.223
spicy than with the soup.

00:01:42.223 --> 00:01:43.240
(guys groaning)

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.699
(Eugene and Keith laughing)

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:46.058
- So Alexandria is going up

00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:46.891
against Keith.

00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.062
Zack is going up against Ned.

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:49.732
And I'm going up against YB.

00:01:49.732 --> 00:01:51.465
So whatever happens try to beat

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:52.475
your partner.

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:54.636
- [Zack] Level zero.

00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:55.726
- [Eugene] So this is mild.

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:58.148
- [Peter] So we have the Tokyo
style no soup level zero.

00:01:58.148 --> 00:01:59.442
Just to give you guys a visualization of

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:00.727
our numbing pepper.

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:02.187
This is gonna be our sansho pepper

00:02:02.187 --> 00:02:03.024
right here.

00:02:03.024 --> 00:02:05.032
It's gonna be before you ground it up

00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:05.972
and this is what it's gonna look like

00:02:05.972 --> 00:02:07.513
when it goes into the soup.

00:02:07.513 --> 00:02:08.346
- Wow.

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:10.387
- You got this peanuts, you got
some scallions, you got some

00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:12.025
minced onion it looks like or

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:13.043
maybe it's minced garlic.

00:02:13.043 --> 00:02:14.850
- [Peter] Alright, number
one restaurant item is

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.005
actually the Tokyo style.

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.019
It's more of a creamy nutty taste

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.472
because of that peanut butter flavor.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.357
- Cheers.

00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:21.190
- Little cheers.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.607
- Cheers, cheers.

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:28.812
- Oh yeah.

00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:29.645
Oh my goodness.

00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:30.772
- That peanut butter is really good.

00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:31.649
- Oh it's incredible

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:32.889
I love the peanut butter taste.

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:33.899
- And it's thick noodles.

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.490
- I've never had any noodle that

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.977
has such a like peanutty sweetness to it.

00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:38.810
- [YB] Yeah.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.974
- And the noodles itself
are just perfect ratio.

00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:42.949
- Perfectly cooked.

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.805
- You guys it reminds me of a Jajangmyeon.

00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:45.727
That Korean dish.

00:02:45.727 --> 00:02:46.978
YB you're gonna (word
bleeped out) flip over this.

00:02:46.978 --> 00:02:49.053
- Did you say Jojo meow?

00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:50.828
- Yes, Jojo meow.

00:02:50.828 --> 00:02:51.878
- Jojo meow.

00:02:51.878 --> 00:02:52.711
Thick and creamy.

00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:54.067
And the peanut butter
really shines through.

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:57.150
Really reminds me a lot of Jojo meow.

00:02:57.995 --> 00:02:59.830
- So Jajangmyeon is a
Korean-Chinese dish that

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.663
has like a

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:01.546
- [Alexandria] Black bean

00:03:01.546 --> 00:03:02.379
- [Eugene] Black bean paste.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.045
And that black bean is
[Inaudible] to this pork mixed

00:03:04.045 --> 00:03:04.878
with the peanut butter.

00:03:04.878 --> 00:03:05.764
Gives it a similar like

00:03:05.764 --> 00:03:07.804
umami umptious flavor.

00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:09.944
- Thick Pad Thai mix with ramen.

00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:10.777
- Yeah.

00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:12.306
I like this but I am seeing

00:03:12.306 --> 00:03:13.668
why you need that spice.

00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:14.774
It's missing the chili oil.

00:03:14.774 --> 00:03:16.163
- This reminds me that there's just

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:18.293
a world of cuisines between

00:03:18.293 --> 00:03:19.345
Asian cuisines.

00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:21.523
There's Korean-Chinese food.

00:03:21.523 --> 00:03:22.370
and this is like kind of somewhere

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.812
between Japanese and Chinese.

00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:24.937
- When cultures meet they make

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.632
beautiful food babies.

00:03:26.632 --> 00:03:29.965
(angelic noise playing)

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.767
- [Keith] Level one.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.823
Beautiful.

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:36.656
- [YB] Different color.

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:37.982
- [Ned] It's getting orangey.

00:03:37.982 --> 00:03:39.648
- [Eugene] I already taste
the spice just on the

00:03:39.648 --> 00:03:40.481
- [Zack] No way.

00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.781
- On the chopstick. Yeah.

00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:43.614
- So good.

00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:44.447
- That's delicious.

00:03:44.447 --> 00:03:45.280
- Oh incredible.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.113
- Okay.

00:03:46.113 --> 00:03:46.946
- It brings it up.

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:48.219
- I see you chili oil.

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:49.221
- And on our spiciness side

00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:50.770
we do use cayenne pepper and some of

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.802
our own homemade chili oil.

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:54.458
That's gonna be only up to level three.

00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:56.170
We actually have up until level six.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.397
Now, how do we get that high.

00:03:57.397 --> 00:03:58.717
It's gonna be ghost pepper.

00:03:58.717 --> 00:03:59.550
- Oh no.

00:04:00.771 --> 00:04:01.717
- [Zack] Eugene, I know that your spice

00:04:01.717 --> 00:04:03.410
tolerance is impenetrable.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.902
- Well, ghost peppers
are tough for anybody.

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:07.206
It's more just me being

00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:08.198
- Stubborn.

00:04:08.198 --> 00:04:09.205
- Stubborn, yeah.

00:04:09.205 --> 00:04:10.699
- [Keith] I do think it need more spice.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:11.532
- [YB] I agree.

00:04:11.532 --> 00:04:13.011
- [Keith] Even as a
little spice baby myself.

00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:14.064
I know that the flavor

00:04:14.064 --> 00:04:15.714
will only get better

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:16.684
with more chili oil.

00:04:16.684 --> 00:04:17.782
- [Keith] I have been eating a lot

00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:19.428
of spicy Chinese noodles in the last

00:04:19.428 --> 00:04:20.261
couple years.

00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:21.894
So I think I can at least get in

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.356
to the ghost pepper round.

00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:24.189
Level four.

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.022
- [YB] Four.

00:04:25.022 --> 00:04:26.810
- The thing is I love the spice flavor but

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.231
I got this weak Jewish belly.

00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:29.557
My people did not eat spice for

00:04:29.557 --> 00:04:30.763
many, many years.

00:04:30.763 --> 00:04:31.996
- [Eugene] That's why we're bringing the

00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:33.760
Food Babies, YB and Alexandria to

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.716
come join us.

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:35.828
Mainly YB.

00:04:35.828 --> 00:04:38.356
(guys laughing)
- I believe in you Alexandria.

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:39.860
- Alex can not handle spice.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.693
- I don't do well.

00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:42.103
I think hot Cheetos are really hot.

00:04:42.103 --> 00:04:42.936
- Oh geez.

00:04:42.936 --> 00:04:43.769
- But I enjoy 'em

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:44.713
I like spice but I can't handle it.

00:04:44.713 --> 00:04:45.688
- What is she doing here?

00:04:45.688 --> 00:04:47.165
- Lady Keith, you're lady Keith

00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:48.178
- I jut wanted me included

00:04:48.178 --> 00:04:50.004
- I just wanted me included.

00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:51.541
- This isn't about friendship.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.361
- The flavor and the spice
I good but there's no heat.

00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:54.194
Lots of flavor.

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:55.373
- The tiniest bit of heat.

00:04:55.373 --> 00:04:57.039
- Zero heat.
- I can feel it in my throat.

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.319
- I usually eat a lot of spicy

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.640
Korean food in general.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.611
But I don't think I'm technically

00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:02.444
good at spice.

00:05:02.444 --> 00:05:04.243
I think I'm just better at hiding it.

00:05:04.243 --> 00:05:06.349
So hopefully I can make it 'til six.

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:07.973
- I maybe bad at Mukbangs but

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:09.813
I really like spicy food.

00:05:09.813 --> 00:05:11.723
Even when it hurts me.

00:05:11.723 --> 00:05:14.177
- [Ned] You may remember me dousing wasabi

00:05:14.177 --> 00:05:15.715
in the sushi video.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.519
- Level one is perfect. Everyone
can be able to handle it.

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.330
There's zero spice for me in this.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.545
- This is my ideal spice level.

00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:21.554
I can't handle anymore.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:22.444
- This is your ideal spice level?

00:05:22.444 --> 00:05:24.110
- We'll see how the rest goes?
- You're nuts.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.328
- You are, you are.

00:05:25.328 --> 00:05:26.230
- Ideal is like if I don't have to

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.500
take a sip of water between every bite

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.650
then the next one might get me there.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.233
- [Zack] Level two.

00:05:34.184 --> 00:05:35.134
- [Alexandria] This one looks spicier.

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:35.967
- [Zack] Some dusting.

00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:37.304
- [Keith] I see the dust now.

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:38.962
I think I'm gonna start feeling it here.

00:05:38.962 --> 00:05:40.388
I'm trying into level four.

00:05:40.388 --> 00:05:41.221
- Yeah.

00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:42.054
- I'm just being honest.

00:05:42.054 --> 00:05:42.914
- I think you can do it.

00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:43.747
- [Alexandria] Well I know
I'm supposed to beat Keith.

00:05:43.747 --> 00:05:44.773
But I really wanna beat YB.

00:05:44.773 --> 00:05:46.392
- Good luck.

00:05:46.392 --> 00:05:47.321
- You are delusional.

00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:48.564
- That's my one goal.

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:50.078
- I appreciate you shooting for the moon

00:05:50.078 --> 00:05:52.992
but you're gonna land in like Toledo.

00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:53.880
- Here we go.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.713
- Cheers.

00:05:54.713 --> 00:05:55.546
- Cheers.

00:05:55.546 --> 00:05:56.379
- Alright.

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.516
(intense music playing)

00:06:00.516 --> 00:06:01.839
- [Alexandria] I feel
the heat on this one.

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:02.672
- Yeah.

00:06:02.672 --> 00:06:03.505
- It's still really good.

00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:05.009
- You can like taste it before

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.195
it even reaches your tongue.

00:06:06.195 --> 00:06:08.040
- The flavor is starting to equal out

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.782
between peanut butter and chili oil.

00:06:09.782 --> 00:06:10.615
- I agree.

00:06:10.615 --> 00:06:11.448
- Oh yeah, the numb.

00:06:11.448 --> 00:06:12.281
Here's comes the numb.

00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:13.542
- [Peter] We do have a numbness

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:14.859
and the spiciness side.

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:15.692
The numbness comes from our

00:06:15.692 --> 00:06:16.548
sansho peppers.

00:06:16.548 --> 00:06:17.777
Don't get that confused
with sichuan pepper.

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:19.912
It does create a very numbing effect

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.618
but the key difference is
that when you drink water

00:06:21.618 --> 00:06:23.363
it's gonna have a much more

00:06:23.363 --> 00:06:25.033
citrusy after taste.

00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:27.408
- Rather than kind of
metallic after taste.

00:06:27.408 --> 00:06:29.074
- Yes.
- We get with some of this.

00:06:29.074 --> 00:06:29.907
- That sounds nice.

00:06:29.907 --> 00:06:30.740
- Yeah.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.713
- You have like a tingling on your tongue.

00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:34.584
- I kind of taste the
peppercorness through my nose.

00:06:34.584 --> 00:06:36.377
It's more of how it breathes than

00:06:36.377 --> 00:06:37.577
how I taste it itself.

00:06:37.577 --> 00:06:39.226
- I do taste the citrus a little bit.

00:06:39.226 --> 00:06:40.386
- Oh it is citrusy.

00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:41.219
- Yeah.

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:42.052
- I' trying to compare it to something

00:06:42.052 --> 00:06:42.885
that people can relate to.

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:43.718
Numbing

00:06:43.718 --> 00:06:44.551
- [Camera guy] Just tingles.

00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:45.675
- It's like an epidural for your mouth.

00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:48.182
- [Camera woman] Alexandria
has never had an epidural.

00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:49.369
- You don't know that.

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:52.396
(everyone laughing)

00:06:52.396 --> 00:06:54.890
- I will say that the nose blowing

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.723
has begun.

00:06:55.723 --> 00:06:56.556
- Uh oh.

00:06:56.556 --> 00:06:57.389
- [Ned] Oh yes.

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:58.701
- I'm feeling good.

00:06:58.701 --> 00:06:59.715
I'm starting to feel like

00:06:59.715 --> 00:07:01.559
like I've got some energy.

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:03.484
Kinda like I have fiver hour energy

00:07:03.484 --> 00:07:04.684
or a Red Bull.

00:07:04.684 --> 00:07:07.908
- This is where I would
want to eat my dinner.

00:07:07.908 --> 00:07:10.179
I'm feeling a nice thin layer of

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:11.382
perspiration.

00:07:11.382 --> 00:07:13.187
A lingering heat.

00:07:13.187 --> 00:07:14.755
Where I feel like if I breath

00:07:14.755 --> 00:07:15.942
I can light a candle.

00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:17.258
- It's honestly about at the same spice

00:07:17.258 --> 00:07:19.468
as the Keith's chicken sauce.

00:07:19.468 --> 00:07:20.574
- And now we are going to level three

00:07:20.574 --> 00:07:22.896
which is the most popular spice level

00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:24.831
that's ordered at this restaurant.

00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:26.389
- [Peter] Hey guys, I've
got level three right here.

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.212
This gonna be our house standard level.

00:07:28.212 --> 00:07:29.161
- House standard.

00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:29.994
- House standard.

00:07:29.994 --> 00:07:31.660
- Meaning if you can't
handle this you're weak.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.533
- [Keith] Oh wow. It smells more intense.

00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:34.469
I'm really smelling
the floral notes of the

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:36.062
peppercorn now.

00:07:36.062 --> 00:07:37.331
- [YB] I feel like we're like pre-gaming.

00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:39.333
And we're taking more and more shots

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:40.684
and we're getting drunker

00:07:40.684 --> 00:07:41.517
- It does feel like we're
gonna go out to a party

00:07:41.517 --> 00:07:42.739
where we have noodles later.

00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:46.123
- By the time we get to the
party we'll be pretty bust.

00:07:46.123 --> 00:07:48.979
- [Keith] We'll be spicied out.

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.084
- [Eugene] Ah so good.

00:07:50.084 --> 00:07:51.475
- That's spicy.

00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:52.935
- Alright, this is the last round

00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:54.136
before ghost peppers.

00:07:54.136 --> 00:07:55.100
- Let's enjoy.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.249
- Let's enjoy this final moment.

00:07:56.249 --> 00:07:58.007
- Let's try to enjoy it.

00:07:58.007 --> 00:07:58.840
- Cheers.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.340
- In the eye of the hurricane.

00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:07.562
- It's still delicious.

00:08:07.562 --> 00:08:08.813
A lot of times spice

00:08:08.813 --> 00:08:10.485
reaches a place where

00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:13.284
you no longer can taste or feel.

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.957
This still has tremendous flavor.

00:08:14.957 --> 00:08:16.378
- My nose is starting to run a little bit.

00:08:16.378 --> 00:08:17.211
- Which is great.

00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:18.209
I've been a little congested.

00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:20.457
- I feel like I'm in an Uber
right now going to a party

00:08:20.457 --> 00:08:21.290
(techno music playing)

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.123
and you know when you

00:08:22.123 --> 00:08:22.956
are kinda like tipsy

00:08:22.956 --> 00:08:23.789
and you're talking a lot.

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:24.622
- How long have you lived in LA?

00:08:24.622 --> 00:08:25.556
What part of LA are you in?

00:08:25.556 --> 00:08:27.477
Oh cool yeah, I don't know where that is.

00:08:27.477 --> 00:08:29.916
- Yeah this makes me excited to talk

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:31.156
to strangers.

00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:32.387
- Gotta tell you right now,

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:33.556
It taste the most delicious.

00:08:33.556 --> 00:08:34.722
It taste really good.

00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:35.660
I'm starting to feel a little bit of the

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.540
a little bit of the "Hey."

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.337
I'm starting to be "Woo" over here.

00:08:40.337 --> 00:08:41.810
Starting to sweat a little bit.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.209
Starting to sweat, feeling good.

00:08:43.209 --> 00:08:46.026
- I feel a bit of heat
building in my body.

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.369
Behind my skin but

00:08:47.369 --> 00:08:48.202
I don't feel my mouth.

00:08:48.202 --> 00:08:49.175
- Behind your skin?

00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:50.842
- Yeah, you know when you're like

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:52.372
ingesting really spicy food.

00:08:52.372 --> 00:08:53.561
- The ghost behind him.

00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:56.534
(Keith laughing)

00:08:56.534 --> 00:08:57.474
- So very warm.

00:08:57.474 --> 00:08:59.391
My body's getting warm.

00:09:00.338 --> 00:09:01.936
- Yeah, we're getting some water works

00:09:01.936 --> 00:09:02.769
over here.

00:09:02.769 --> 00:09:05.982
Can I get a water works checked?

00:09:05.982 --> 00:09:07.814
- That wasn't as bad as I
thought it was gonna be.

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:08.647
- Easy buckets.

00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:10.557
- Maybe I'll beat YB.

00:09:10.557 --> 00:09:12.330
But I think after this is
when it really takes off.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.163
Right?

00:09:13.163 --> 00:09:14.362
- Yeah, we're about to
enter ghost pepper town.

00:09:14.362 --> 00:09:16.293
(guys burping)

00:09:16.293 --> 00:09:17.282
- Yeah, we're ready for the next one.

00:09:17.282 --> 00:09:19.470
- [Peter] Alright guys, we
got level four right here.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.527
This is gonna be where our
spicy challenge starts to begin.

00:09:22.527 --> 00:09:24.080
It's from here that we started adding

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.027
our ghost peppers.

00:09:25.027 --> 00:09:26.825
So be very careful.
- [Keith] Oh wow. It's smells.

00:09:26.825 --> 00:09:27.658
Smell it.

00:09:27.658 --> 00:09:29.324
Can you smell it?
- Oh yeah, I can smell it.

00:09:29.324 --> 00:09:30.157
- Oh wow.

00:09:30.157 --> 00:09:31.384
- It's gonna be a linear progression

00:09:31.384 --> 00:09:32.813
from zero to three.

00:09:32.813 --> 00:09:34.235
But from four, five and six it's

00:09:34.235 --> 00:09:35.307
gonna be an exponential growth.

00:09:35.307 --> 00:09:37.088
So be ready.

00:09:37.088 --> 00:09:39.441
- So it does it like
this and then like that.

00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:40.870
- Yeah, It just goes straight up.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.537
- They say this is a religious experience.

00:09:42.537 --> 00:09:44.152
I can feel it in my temples.

00:09:44.152 --> 00:09:45.434
- Okay should we do this?

00:09:45.434 --> 00:09:46.984
- Did you guys get it?

00:09:46.984 --> 00:09:47.944
- Oh I get it.

00:09:47.944 --> 00:09:49.111
I just got it.

00:09:49.948 --> 00:09:51.953
- Did you get it Ned?
- Oh yeah I got it earlier

00:09:51.953 --> 00:09:52.877
- But you didn't laugh.

00:09:52.877 --> 00:09:53.812
- But I didn't like it.

00:09:53.812 --> 00:09:55.075
- Thank you.

00:09:55.075 --> 00:09:55.908
- Cheers.

00:09:55.908 --> 00:09:56.741
- Cheers.

00:09:56.741 --> 00:09:57.574
- I might only get one bite here

00:09:57.574 --> 00:09:58.637
so I'm just gonna go for it.

00:09:58.637 --> 00:10:01.970
(intense music playing)

00:10:03.414 --> 00:10:04.381
- Whoa.

00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:05.776
- Oh yeah.

00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:06.616
Oh yeah.

00:10:06.616 --> 00:10:07.666
- There she is.

00:10:07.666 --> 00:10:09.249
- Okay, I taste it.

00:10:11.965 --> 00:10:13.710
(Keith coughing)

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.543
- Oh wow.

00:10:14.543 --> 00:10:15.376
Oh.

00:10:17.953 --> 00:10:18.872
This got shivers.

00:10:18.872 --> 00:10:20.186
- You described your food as painful,

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:21.909
spicy and delicious.

00:10:21.909 --> 00:10:23.229
Why painful?

00:10:23.229 --> 00:10:25.126
- Well that pain really does release

00:10:25.126 --> 00:10:26.320
those endorphins.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.960
And that creates that
euphoric effect, Right?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.508
- Okay, so we might
experience euphoria today.

00:10:31.508 --> 00:10:32.341
- You are.

00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:34.249
- Zendaya, that's where we're gonna be at.

00:10:34.249 --> 00:10:36.008
- Is is Zendaya? I thought it's Zandaya?

00:10:36.008 --> 00:10:37.674
Zendaya?
- I thought it was Zendaya?

00:10:37.674 --> 00:10:38.540
- Zendaya?

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.129
- Zendaya, right?

00:10:40.129 --> 00:10:41.072
It's Zendaya, right?

00:10:41.072 --> 00:10:42.249
- From the big foot movie?

00:10:42.249 --> 00:10:43.202
- I see like

00:10:43.202 --> 00:10:45.969
I see like the end of Zendaya's dress.

00:10:45.969 --> 00:10:47.541
Like I see her turning a corner.

00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:50.545
- This is when it's hard to breath out.

00:10:50.545 --> 00:10:52.062
- It's not like just "Oh that's hot.".

00:10:52.062 --> 00:10:53.162
It's like "Oh it hurts.".

00:10:53.162 --> 00:10:54.168
But I do want more.

00:10:54.168 --> 00:10:55.433
- [YB] It's really good.

00:10:55.433 --> 00:10:57.509
- Oh my god this is sending me places.

00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:58.946
Wow this is a trip.

00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:00.266
- And it lingers a lot.

00:11:00.266 --> 00:11:01.099
It's not going away.

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:02.147
It's like in my gums.

00:11:02.147 --> 00:11:05.054
- Oh the water taste crazy.
- [YB] My tongue is like

00:11:05.054 --> 00:11:06.264
vibrating

00:11:06.264 --> 00:11:08.307
from the water.

00:11:08.307 --> 00:11:09.140
- I'm sweaty.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.279
You're sweaty.

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:11.710
- I'm sweating but it feels good like

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.377
I'm kinda turned on.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.034
- Well of course, I think it's fair to say

00:11:16.034 --> 00:11:16.867
we're all kind of turned on.

00:11:16.867 --> 00:11:17.700
- It's like an Asian proverb.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.917
I don't think it's fair to say that.

00:11:19.917 --> 00:11:22.025
- You guys know the old Asian proverb

00:11:22.025 --> 00:11:23.270
- that says like " The
most fun you can have

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.938
outside the bedroom is
the spice challenge.".

00:11:24.938 --> 00:11:26.844
- That's probably where I would stop.

00:11:26.844 --> 00:11:28.230
- Yeah, this would be
optimum spice level if

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.898
I'm like looking to have a good time.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:30.879
- I feel like a pop star.

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:32.545
- You look crazy right
now. What's happening?

00:11:32.545 --> 00:11:34.882
- I feel like a pop star
who's taking her solo.

00:11:34.882 --> 00:11:38.349
(Keith singing)
- I wanna feel like what

00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:39.747
- You're starting to cry.

00:11:39.747 --> 00:11:41.669
- I wanna feel what five feels like

00:11:41.669 --> 00:11:44.115
but I don't think I can go past five.

00:11:44.115 --> 00:11:45.841
Even now my mouth is hot.

00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:47.494
I feel like very euphoric.

00:11:47.494 --> 00:11:48.327
I feel like

00:11:48.327 --> 00:11:49.383
Hey, let's go to a party.

00:11:49.383 --> 00:11:50.503
Which party should we go to?

00:11:50.503 --> 00:11:51.336
I don't know.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:52.169
Let's talk about it.

00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:53.002
Let's think about.

00:11:53.002 --> 00:11:54.668
Let's talk about it. What's
really cute for me right now

00:11:54.668 --> 00:11:55.672
is I have simultaneous tears.

00:11:55.672 --> 00:11:56.827
And they're like at the same place

00:11:56.827 --> 00:11:57.944
in each eye.

00:11:57.944 --> 00:11:59.337
They're like "Yes.".

00:11:59.337 --> 00:12:00.460
Let's move up.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.293
- Really?

00:12:01.293 --> 00:12:02.126
- Let's go.

00:12:02.126 --> 00:12:02.959
- [YB] Ready?

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:04.367
- Let's (bleeped word) go for it.

00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:05.625
- Level five.

00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:06.945
- [Zack] Level five.

00:12:06.945 --> 00:12:09.011
- [Peter] So I got level
five right here for you guys.

00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:09.844
As you can see,

00:12:09.844 --> 00:12:12.879
It's gonna be a lot more
of a dense red color.

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:14.104
- [Zack] All that peppering is the sansho.

00:12:14.104 --> 00:12:15.198
- [Peter] It's the sansho
and the ghost pepper.

00:12:15.198 --> 00:12:16.031
- [Zack] Wow.

00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:17.360
(Eugene laughing)

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.299
- Fantastic.

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:19.303
- [Ned] I gotta say

00:12:19.303 --> 00:12:20.738
I'm starting to get a little nervous

00:12:20.738 --> 00:12:21.621
about this one.

00:12:21.621 --> 00:12:23.091
If that one's a four and this

00:12:23.091 --> 00:12:24.403
one's a five.

00:12:24.403 --> 00:12:27.363
- And they said it gets
exponentially crazier.

00:12:27.363 --> 00:12:28.673
- Oh that's true.

00:12:28.673 --> 00:12:30.198
- [Eugene] This one you can actually smell

00:12:30.198 --> 00:12:32.097
the spice wafting off of this dish.

00:12:32.097 --> 00:12:33.427
Which is incredible.

00:12:33.427 --> 00:12:34.260
- Cheers.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.093
- Cheers.

00:12:35.093 --> 00:12:35.926
- Clingky-clingk.

00:12:35.926 --> 00:12:36.759
- Cheers.

00:12:37.984 --> 00:12:39.032
- Here we go.

00:12:39.032 --> 00:12:42.365
(intense music playing)

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:51.605
(Zack screaming)

00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:52.438
- Oh my god.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:55.984
(heavy metal music playing)

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:56.959
- Oh my god.

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:58.313
(Zack laughing)

00:12:58.313 --> 00:12:59.685
- Oh yeah.

00:12:59.685 --> 00:13:03.102
There's a deep under current in this one.

00:13:04.558 --> 00:13:06.103
We got a round house kick.

00:13:06.103 --> 00:13:08.691
A tongue slap and then

00:13:08.691 --> 00:13:10.274
- You're getting a
little moist on the face.

00:13:10.274 --> 00:13:11.172
- Yeah.

00:13:11.172 --> 00:13:12.881
- [Ned] I'm feeling it.

00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:13.724
- It's good.

00:13:13.724 --> 00:13:14.967
It's tasty.

00:13:14.967 --> 00:13:16.327
- Oh that's real good spice.

00:13:16.327 --> 00:13:17.593
- [Zack] Oh my god.

00:13:17.593 --> 00:13:19.530
- Freaking good.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.109
- The taste is still very good.

00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:23.017
Yeah it's a different experience now.

00:13:23.017 --> 00:13:24.434
It's painful now.

00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.796
- [Zack] Swirling around.

00:13:27.796 --> 00:13:28.724
- You know those spinners that you put

00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:30.834
the salad in and you press the button.

00:13:30.834 --> 00:13:32.670
Feels like someone is
doing that to my brain.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.503
- [Camera guy] Salad spinner.

00:13:33.503 --> 00:13:34.336
- Salad spinner?

00:13:34.336 --> 00:13:35.169
That's what they call it?

00:13:35.169 --> 00:13:36.002
How 'bout that?

00:13:36.002 --> 00:13:37.217
What a straight forward name.

00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:39.594
(xylophone music playing)

00:13:39.594 --> 00:13:41.381
- I'm ascending.

00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:43.007
I'm a ghost.

00:13:43.007 --> 00:13:44.074
Oh wow, oh wow.

00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:45.324
- Are you okay?

00:13:48.998 --> 00:13:50.573
(YB laughing)

00:13:50.573 --> 00:13:53.073
(slow motion)

00:13:55.329 --> 00:13:57.776
- His face is so close to me.

00:13:57.776 --> 00:13:59.561
- That's like the right
type of painful, you know?

00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:00.394
- No.

00:14:00.394 --> 00:14:01.448
(everyone laughing)

00:14:01.448 --> 00:14:02.533
- [Zack] You're wet.

00:14:02.533 --> 00:14:03.530
(everyone laughing)

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.925
- There's an old Asian proverb that says

00:14:04.925 --> 00:14:05.758
"You're food isn't good if

00:14:05.758 --> 00:14:06.962
you're not sweating buckets.".

00:14:06.962 --> 00:14:08.720
- There's an old Jewish proverb that goes

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.577
"Oy.".

00:14:09.577 --> 00:14:12.248
(everyone laughing)

00:14:12.248 --> 00:14:13.380
(Alexandria coughing)

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.046
- That's yeah, I'm gonna
have to tap out here.

00:14:15.046 --> 00:14:17.505
(bell dings)

00:14:17.505 --> 00:14:18.422
- Proud of you Keith.

00:14:18.422 --> 00:14:19.710
- I want a popsicle please.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.965
(YB laughing)

00:14:22.965 --> 00:14:23.798
- [Ned] Cool down that brain fire.

00:14:23.798 --> 00:14:24.764
- Yeah.

00:14:24.764 --> 00:14:27.162
- It's so good though
wish I could eat more.

00:14:27.162 --> 00:14:28.303
- It is really good.

00:14:28.303 --> 00:14:30.163
- I want to keep going.

00:14:30.163 --> 00:14:31.446
I fear that it is personally

00:14:31.446 --> 00:14:33.209
irresponsible and reckless for me to

00:14:33.209 --> 00:14:34.529
even attempt another bite.

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:35.362
(bell dings)

00:14:35.362 --> 00:14:36.626
I can't believe I made it this far.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:37.724
This is spectacular

00:14:37.724 --> 00:14:38.904
but this is all I can handle.

00:14:38.904 --> 00:14:39.757
Wow.

00:14:39.757 --> 00:14:41.637
- The heats starting to
travel to the outside

00:14:41.637 --> 00:14:42.470
of my mouth.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:43.303
Like on my face.

00:14:43.303 --> 00:14:44.136
- Are you okay?

00:14:44.136 --> 00:14:45.380
- I think I got the noodles on my face.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.046
- [Zack] Oh no. I'm very
proud of you Alexandria.

00:14:47.046 --> 00:14:50.025
I'm like truly wildly impress with how

00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:50.858
well you are doing

00:14:50.858 --> 00:14:52.107
- Thank you, just gotta beat YB.

00:14:52.107 --> 00:14:53.361
(Alexandria coughing)

00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:54.833
- Oh yeah.

00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:55.666
- Are you guys gonna go to six?

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:56.499
You gonna go for it?

00:14:56.499 --> 00:14:57.332
- Oh yeah, let's go.

00:14:57.332 --> 00:14:58.973
- Let's do this.

00:14:58.973 --> 00:14:59.806
Aw.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:01.608
- [Peter] Alright guys, got
the level six right here.

00:15:01.608 --> 00:15:05.300
As you can see it's gonna
be a much more black color.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.718
- [Eugene] The hottest
level they have on the menu.

00:15:07.718 --> 00:15:11.339
And we are going to try
to finish our full bowl of

00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:13.359
level six, otherwise you tap out.

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:14.698
- And I brought some ghost peppers just

00:15:14.698 --> 00:15:16.153
in case you wanna [Inaudible] do it.

00:15:16.153 --> 00:15:17.028
- Wow.

00:15:17.028 --> 00:15:17.861
- Wow.

00:15:17.861 --> 00:15:19.085
- Yes.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.708
'Bout to off-road it.

00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:21.837
- My scalp is sweating.

00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:23.656
You know when you work out and

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:26.033
just your head is really wet.
That's where I am right now.

00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:28.484
- [Keith] Wow, look at
that. That looks so scary.

00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:29.667
- Alexandria, someone who has failed

00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:31.822
almost exclusively for the past six years.

00:15:31.822 --> 00:15:33.753
You can still get really far in life.

00:15:33.753 --> 00:15:35.622
I own a company, I make videos,

00:15:35.622 --> 00:15:37.807
I'm arguably equally as popular as

00:15:37.807 --> 00:15:39.117
the other guys.

00:15:39.117 --> 00:15:39.950
You know?

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.617
You could fail all the way to the top.

00:15:41.617 --> 00:15:42.450
- I do agree.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.528
This is the one thing I needed to do.

00:15:43.528 --> 00:15:44.529
And then I'm quitting my job.

00:15:44.529 --> 00:15:47.177
(everyone laughing)

00:15:47.177 --> 00:15:48.010
- Cheers.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:48.843
- Cheers.

00:15:48.843 --> 00:15:49.676
- Cheers.

00:15:49.676 --> 00:15:53.635
(intense music playing)

00:15:53.635 --> 00:15:54.468
- [Keith] Keep going

00:15:54.468 --> 00:15:55.635
Don't give up.

00:15:56.961 --> 00:16:00.294
(intense music playing)

00:16:01.396 --> 00:16:02.229
- Whoa.

00:16:06.004 --> 00:16:06.971
- Oh my god.

00:16:06.971 --> 00:16:07.804
- Oh yeah.

00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:12.108
- Do not get this on a date.

00:16:12.108 --> 00:16:12.941
(Ned laughing)

00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:15.691
(Keith laughing)

00:16:17.603 --> 00:16:19.290
- [Eugene] This is the
first one I actually feel

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.931
the spice go down my esophagus.
The way I'm gonna beat YB is

00:16:21.931 --> 00:16:23.764
I'm only having water.

00:16:25.416 --> 00:16:27.418
- It's got a kick to it, you know?

00:16:27.418 --> 00:16:28.733
- I feel like I just went to a dentist

00:16:28.733 --> 00:16:30.312
they numbed my tongue.

00:16:30.312 --> 00:16:32.503
- Oh yeah, my mouth is just drooling.

00:16:32.503 --> 00:16:34.169
- Same.
- Let's go. Let's go back in.

00:16:34.169 --> 00:16:35.017
- You got this girl.

00:16:35.017 --> 00:16:36.326
Don't give up now.

00:16:36.326 --> 00:16:38.610
I will say you aren't the waterfall that

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:39.970
Eugene is right now.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:40.934
- That is so

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:41.767
- [Zack] Oh my god.

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:42.684
- So spicy.

00:16:43.898 --> 00:16:45.733
- It's like that "Key and Peele" episode

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:46.736
we're his just sweating balls.

00:16:46.736 --> 00:16:49.650
- So spicy but it makes me feel so good.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.198
- You should open up early on Sunday

00:16:51.198 --> 00:16:52.636
and call it Sunday service.

00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:54.021
And let people see God.

00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:55.677
- Oh boy.

00:16:55.677 --> 00:16:57.517
My tongue is made up of metal.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.600
Clang, clang.

00:17:00.604 --> 00:17:03.009
- This like swallowing fire and hell.

00:17:03.009 --> 00:17:05.997
It's literally like lava is going down

00:17:05.997 --> 00:17:06.830
my belly.

00:17:07.982 --> 00:17:10.668
I feel like I'm seeing
a whole another level

00:17:10.668 --> 00:17:12.283
of spirituality

00:17:12.283 --> 00:17:14.599
- Oh no , don't wipe your eyes.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:15.851
- (bleeped word) Well.

00:17:15.851 --> 00:17:17.112
- Starting to get full.

00:17:17.112 --> 00:17:17.945
- I'm full too.

00:17:17.945 --> 00:17:18.794
I'm really full.

00:17:18.794 --> 00:17:19.627
- I'm not full.

00:17:19.627 --> 00:17:21.293
See, I wish I wish you had my stomach

00:17:21.293 --> 00:17:22.126
and I have your mouth.

00:17:22.126 --> 00:17:23.792
Oh no. now we would just be both be it,

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:25.542
it would be mixed up.

00:17:26.985 --> 00:17:29.730
- I'm really, really, not doing good.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.251
I'm debating whether to finish or not.

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:34.052
I don't know if I can.

00:17:34.052 --> 00:17:34.970
I'm officially tapping out.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.992
(bell dings)

00:17:37.992 --> 00:17:39.436
As Zack advised I'm gonna quit.

00:17:39.436 --> 00:17:40.584
I think I did pretty good.

00:17:40.584 --> 00:17:41.417
- You did well.

00:17:41.417 --> 00:17:42.547
- You've been amazing.

00:17:42.547 --> 00:17:43.683
- I can't anymore.

00:17:43.683 --> 00:17:44.516
- Wow, way to go.

00:17:44.516 --> 00:17:45.349
Way to go Alexandria.

00:17:45.349 --> 00:17:46.182
- [Ned] I will say

00:17:46.182 --> 00:17:47.596
what is limiting me right now

00:17:47.596 --> 00:17:49.877
is my stomach volume.

00:17:49.877 --> 00:17:54.020
So I am going to take a
pinch of the ghost pepper.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:54.899
- What?

00:17:54.899 --> 00:17:55.732
- And count...

00:17:55.732 --> 00:17:56.565
(Keith laughing)

00:17:56.565 --> 00:17:57.810
- No, Ned.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.736
- I'm making my own challenge YB.

00:18:00.736 --> 00:18:01.784
- Ned loves bad ideas.

00:18:01.784 --> 00:18:03.953
- Don't use your fingers.

00:18:03.953 --> 00:18:05.674
- Oh my god.

00:18:05.674 --> 00:18:06.507
- Yes, yes Ned.

00:18:06.507 --> 00:18:07.723
Don't back down now.

00:18:07.723 --> 00:18:10.249
(intense music playing)

00:18:10.249 --> 00:18:11.216
- Oh my god.

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:14.549
(intense music playing)

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:19.169
- What do you see?

00:18:23.641 --> 00:18:25.264
- I wanna get further away.

00:18:25.264 --> 00:18:26.574
[Inaudible]

00:18:26.574 --> 00:18:27.878
- Euphoria!

00:18:27.878 --> 00:18:30.616
(Ned Screaming)

00:18:30.616 --> 00:18:32.993
I feel like I'm looking through

00:18:32.993 --> 00:18:34.804
a kaleidoscope right now.

00:18:34.804 --> 00:18:38.284
My entire vision is just doing this.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.601
Click, click.

00:18:39.601 --> 00:18:41.226
(bell dings)

00:18:41.226 --> 00:18:43.559
- I'll have what I'm having.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.362
- Are you gonna finish it?

00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:47.397
- I have to beat YB. Don't
know if she's gonna be

00:18:47.397 --> 00:18:48.442
at the same place as me.

00:18:48.442 --> 00:18:50.996
I just died. But if I finish
this that means YB has to

00:18:50.996 --> 00:18:52.042
finish the whole bowl.

00:18:52.042 --> 00:18:53.573
- You can do it YB.

00:18:53.573 --> 00:18:55.141
We believe in you.

00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:56.205
- Wow, wow.

00:18:56.205 --> 00:18:58.137
You're a hero, you're a hero.

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.501
- [Keith] Show us what you got.

00:18:59.501 --> 00:19:01.809
- [Eugene] YB, this is for you.

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:04.091
- [Zack] Go Eugene, go.

00:19:04.091 --> 00:19:07.391
(intense music playing)

00:19:07.391 --> 00:19:08.224
- I'm done.

00:19:08.224 --> 00:19:09.057
- Okay.

00:19:09.057 --> 00:19:09.890
- There's no more noodles.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:10.723
Alright.

00:19:10.723 --> 00:19:11.923
(bell dings)

00:19:11.923 --> 00:19:13.582
- Look at him, look at him.

00:19:13.582 --> 00:19:15.619
- Eugene, YB and Ned all surpassed

00:19:15.619 --> 00:19:17.042
all expectations.

00:19:17.042 --> 00:19:19.112
Ned did exactly what we thought he'd do

00:19:19.112 --> 00:19:20.912
though with making a terrible decision.

00:19:20.912 --> 00:19:21.890
(Ned screaming)

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:22.723
- I don't like

00:19:22.723 --> 00:19:26.069
I just run a marathon and made love

00:19:26.069 --> 00:19:27.367
at the same time.

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:29.950
Like I need cigarette and I don't smoke.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.316
- Well, I'm proud of us.

00:19:31.316 --> 00:19:34.103
All of us got passed level five.

00:19:34.103 --> 00:19:35.016
- Yeah.

00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:36.748
Zendaya is me.

00:19:36.748 --> 00:19:39.151
- And you have reached chi.

00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:40.447
- Bravo to the team at Killer Noodle.

00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:43.115
You guys have made a spectacular product.

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:44.434
There's some in here for everybody.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:47.227
- It truly is painful, delicious,

00:19:47.227 --> 00:19:48.060
and spicy.

00:19:48.953 --> 00:19:52.036
(Rock music playing)

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:56.913
- That is equilibrium.

00:19:56.913 --> 00:19:58.266
Everything is Math.

00:19:58.266 --> 00:20:00.023
A perfect amount of both spices.

00:20:00.023 --> 00:20:02.082
The stinging spice, the numbing spice.

00:20:02.082 --> 00:20:02.915
Ah.
