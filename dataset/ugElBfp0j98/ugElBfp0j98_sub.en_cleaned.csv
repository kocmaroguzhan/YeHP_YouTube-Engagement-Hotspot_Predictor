0.0,2.799,The hottest level they have on the menu
4.319,5.152,Oh my God
5.152,5.985,Oh Yeah.
6.818,7.651,Yes.
11.024,13.012,Pain really does release those endorphins
13.012,14.317,Euphoria!
21.345,22.68,Try Guys and Food Babies are here at
22.68,23.951999999999998,Tsujita Killer Noodle.
23.951999999999998,25.922,On Sawtelle in Los Angeles.
25.922,27.788,To try the killer noodle challenge.
27.788,31.113,These are some of the spiciest noodles in LA.
31.113,32.73,Nay the country.
32.73,33.563,We're gonna start out with
33.563,35.299,"level zero, quite not killer."
35.299,36.221,And move our way all the
36.221,38.107,"way up to six, very killer."
38.107,40.412,So killer in fact it has ghost in it.
40.412,42.441,"So like every spice video on this channel,"
42.441,45.003,I can't wait for you to see YB and me eat
45.003,45.945,all of it.
45.945,48.502,While the rest of them cry and fail.
48.502,50.123,Like cowards.
53.754,54.587,Hi my name is Peter.
54.587,56.25,And we're here at Killer Noodle Tsujita.
56.25,58.452,Are you guys excited to try a killer noodle challenge today?
58.452,59.719,Yeah.
59.719,60.552,So excited.
60.552,61.385,Hell yeah.
61.385,62.218,The killer noodle was originally
62.218,63.61,founded by Mr. Tsujita back in
63.61,66.127,2011 and from that success he wanted to
66.127,68.43,bring some more concepts into the LA areas.
68.43,70.181,So the killer noodle challenge is really just
70.181,71.277,eating a level six.
71.277,72.634,So today we're gonna work our
72.634,73.586,way up to six.
73.586,75.564,We're gonna be in two teams of three.
75.564,77.032,And at any point we have to drop out.
77.032,78.605,That team loses that member.
78.605,79.966,A lot of our customers come in
79.966,81.417,"and go ""Is it really spicy?"""
81.417,82.42,Because a lot of cases
82.42,83.298,"when they say it's spicy,"
83.298,84.336,it's really not.
84.336,86.529,But here we're spicy and we mean it.
86.529,87.849,So we each have waters here.
87.849,89.213,Water is the only thing you'd really
89.213,90.499,supposed to be drinking.
90.499,91.799,Unless you're gonna tap out.
91.799,93.096,So for all of our different styles of
93.096,95.328,soup there's actually two ways you can get it.
95.328,96.623,With soup and without soup.
96.623,97.808,Today we're gonna be eating the
97.808,99.62,"without soups. Just to give you a heads up,"
99.62,100.708,It is gonna be a lot more
100.708,102.223,spicy than with the soup.
104.699,106.058,So Alexandria is going up
106.058,106.891,against Keith.
106.891,108.062,Zack is going up against Ned.
108.062,109.732,And I'm going up against YB.
109.732,111.465,So whatever happens try to beat
111.465,112.475,your partner.
112.475,114.636,Level zero.
114.636,115.726,So this is mild.
115.726,118.148,So we have the Tokyo style no soup level zero.
118.148,119.442,Just to give you guys a visualization of
119.442,120.727,our numbing pepper.
120.727,122.187,This is gonna be our sansho pepper
122.187,123.024,right here.
123.024,125.032,It's gonna be before you ground it up
125.032,125.972,and this is what it's gonna look like
125.972,127.513,when it goes into the soup.
127.513,128.346,Wow.
128.346,130.387,"You got this peanuts, you got some scallions, you got some"
130.387,132.025,minced onion it looks like or
132.025,133.043,maybe it's minced garlic.
133.043,134.85,"Alright, number one restaurant item is"
134.85,136.005,actually the Tokyo style.
136.005,138.019,It's more of a creamy nutty taste
138.019,139.472,because of that peanut butter flavor.
139.472,140.357,Cheers.
140.357,141.19,Little cheers.
141.19,142.607,"Cheers, cheers."
147.929,148.812,Oh yeah.
148.812,149.645,Oh my goodness.
149.645,150.772,That peanut butter is really good.
150.772,151.649,Oh it's incredible
151.649,152.889,I love the peanut butter taste.
152.889,153.899,And it's thick noodles.
153.899,155.49,I've never had any noodle that
155.49,157.977,has such a like peanutty sweetness to it.
157.977,158.81,Yeah.
158.81,161.974,And the noodles itself are just perfect ratio.
161.974,162.949,Perfectly cooked.
162.949,164.805,You guys it reminds me of a Jajangmyeon.
164.805,165.727,That Korean dish.
165.727,166.978,YB you're gonna flip over this.
166.978,169.053,Did you say Jojo meow?
169.053,170.828,"Yes, Jojo meow."
170.828,171.878,Jojo meow.
171.878,172.711,Thick and creamy.
172.711,174.067,And the peanut butter really shines through.
174.067,177.15,Really reminds me a lot of Jojo meow.
177.995,179.83,So Jajangmyeon is a Korean-Chinese dish that
179.83,180.663,has like a
180.663,181.546,Black bean
181.546,182.379,Black bean paste.
182.379,184.045,And that black bean is to this pork mixed
184.045,184.878,with the peanut butter.
184.878,185.764,Gives it a similar like
185.764,187.804,umami umptious flavor.
187.804,189.944,Thick Pad Thai mix with ramen.
189.944,190.777,Yeah.
190.777,192.306,I like this but I am seeing
192.306,193.668,why you need that spice.
193.668,194.774,It's missing the chili oil.
194.774,196.163,This reminds me that there's just
196.163,198.293,a world of cuisines between
198.293,199.345,Asian cuisines.
199.345,201.523,There's Korean-Chinese food.
201.523,202.37,and this is like kind of somewhere
202.37,203.812,between Japanese and Chinese.
203.812,204.937,When cultures meet they make
204.937,206.632,beautiful food babies.
212.1,213.767,Level one.
214.99,215.823,Beautiful.
215.823,216.656,Different color.
216.656,217.982,It's getting orangey.
217.982,219.648,I already taste the spice just on the
219.648,220.481,No way.
220.481,222.781,On the chopstick. Yeah.
222.781,223.614,So good.
223.614,224.447,That's delicious.
224.447,225.28,Oh incredible.
225.28,226.113,Okay.
226.113,226.946,It brings it up.
226.946,228.219,I see you chili oil.
228.219,229.221,And on our spiciness side
229.221,230.77,we do use cayenne pepper and some of
230.77,232.802,our own homemade chili oil.
232.802,234.458,That's gonna be only up to level three.
234.458,236.17,We actually have up until level six.
236.17,237.397,"Now, how do we get that high."
237.397,238.717,It's gonna be ghost pepper.
238.717,239.55,Oh no.
240.771,241.717,"Eugene, I know that your spice"
241.717,243.41,tolerance is impenetrable.
243.41,245.902,"Well, ghost peppers are tough for anybody."
245.902,247.206,It's more just me being
247.206,248.198,Stubborn.
248.198,249.205,"Stubborn, yeah."
249.205,250.699,I do think it need more spice.
250.699,251.532,I agree.
251.532,253.011,Even as a little spice baby myself.
253.011,254.064,I know that the flavor
254.064,255.714,will only get better
255.714,256.684,with more chili oil.
256.684,257.782,I have been eating a lot
257.782,259.428,of spicy Chinese noodles in the last
259.428,260.261,couple years.
260.261,261.894,So I think I can at least get in
261.894,263.356,to the ghost pepper round.
263.356,264.189,Level four.
264.189,265.022,Four.
265.022,266.81,The thing is I love the spice flavor but
266.81,268.231,I got this weak Jewish belly.
268.231,269.557,My people did not eat spice for
269.557,270.763,"many, many years."
270.763,271.996,That's why we're bringing the
271.996,273.76,"Food Babies, YB and Alexandria to"
273.76,274.716,come join us.
274.716,275.828,Mainly YB.
275.828,278.356,I believe in you Alexandria.
278.356,279.86,Alex can not handle spice.
279.86,280.693,I don't do well.
280.693,282.103,I think hot Cheetos are really hot.
282.103,282.936,Oh geez.
282.936,283.769,But I enjoy 'em
283.769,284.713,I like spice but I can't handle it.
284.713,285.688,What is she doing here?
285.688,287.165,"Lady Keith, you're lady Keith"
287.165,288.178,I jut wanted me included
288.178,290.004,I just wanted me included.
290.004,291.541,This isn't about friendship.
291.541,293.361,The flavor and the spice I good but there's no heat.
293.361,294.194,Lots of flavor.
294.194,295.373,The tiniest bit of heat.
295.373,297.039,Zero heat. I can feel it in my throat.
297.039,298.319,I usually eat a lot of spicy
298.319,299.64,Korean food in general.
299.64,301.611,But I don't think I'm technically
301.611,302.444,good at spice.
302.444,304.243,I think I'm just better at hiding it.
304.243,306.349,So hopefully I can make it 'til six.
306.349,307.973,I maybe bad at Mukbangs but
307.973,309.813,I really like spicy food.
309.813,311.723,Even when it hurts me.
311.723,314.177,You may remember me dousing wasabi
314.177,315.715,in the sushi video.
315.715,317.519,Level one is perfect. Everyone can be able to handle it.
317.519,319.33,There's zero spice for me in this.
319.33,320.545,This is my ideal spice level.
320.545,321.554,I can't handle anymore.
321.554,322.444,This is your ideal spice level?
322.444,324.11,We'll see how the rest goes? You're nuts.
324.11,325.328,"You are, you are."
325.328,326.23,Ideal is like if I don't have to
326.23,328.5,take a sip of water between every bite
328.5,330.65,then the next one might get me there.
330.65,332.233,Level two.
334.184,335.134,This one looks spicier.
335.134,335.967,Some dusting.
335.967,337.304,I see the dust now.
337.304,338.962,I think I'm gonna start feeling it here.
338.962,340.388,I'm trying into level four.
340.388,341.221,Yeah.
341.221,342.054,I'm just being honest.
342.054,342.914,I think you can do it.
342.914,343.747,Well I know I'm supposed to beat Keith.
343.747,344.773,But I really wanna beat YB.
344.773,346.392,Good luck.
346.392,347.321,You are delusional.
347.321,348.564,That's my one goal.
348.564,350.078,I appreciate you shooting for the moon
350.078,352.992,but you're gonna land in like Toledo.
352.992,353.88,Here we go.
353.88,354.713,Cheers.
354.713,355.546,Cheers.
355.546,356.379,Alright.
360.516,361.839,I feel the heat on this one.
361.839,362.672,Yeah.
362.672,363.505,It's still really good.
363.505,365.009,You can like taste it before
365.009,366.195,it even reaches your tongue.
366.195,368.04,The flavor is starting to equal out
368.04,369.782,between peanut butter and chili oil.
369.782,370.615,I agree.
370.615,371.448,"Oh yeah, the numb."
371.448,372.281,Here's comes the numb.
372.281,373.542,We do have a numbness
373.542,374.859,and the spiciness side.
374.859,375.692,The numbness comes from our
375.692,376.548,sansho peppers.
376.548,377.777,Don't get that confused with sichuan pepper.
377.777,379.912,It does create a very numbing effect
379.912,381.618,but the key difference is that when you drink water
381.618,383.363,it's gonna have a much more
383.363,385.033,citrusy after taste.
385.033,387.408,Rather than kind of metallic after taste.
387.408,389.074,Yes. We get with some of this.
389.074,389.907,That sounds nice.
389.907,390.74,Yeah.
390.74,391.713,You have like a tingling on your tongue.
391.713,394.584,I kind of taste the peppercorness through my nose.
394.584,396.377,It's more of how it breathes than
396.377,397.577,how I taste it itself.
397.577,399.226,I do taste the citrus a little bit.
399.226,400.386,Oh it is citrusy.
400.386,401.219,Yeah.
401.219,402.052,I' trying to compare it to something
402.052,402.885,that people can relate to.
402.885,403.718,Numbing
403.718,404.551,Just tingles.
404.551,405.675,It's like an epidural for your mouth.
405.675,408.182,Alexandria has never had an epidural.
408.182,409.369,You don't know that.
412.396,414.89,I will say that the nose blowing
414.89,415.723,has begun.
415.723,416.556,Uh oh.
416.556,417.389,Oh yes.
417.389,418.701,I'm feeling good.
418.701,419.715,I'm starting to feel like
419.715,421.559,like I've got some energy.
421.559,423.484,Kinda like I have fiver hour energy
423.484,424.684,or a Red Bull.
424.684,427.908,This is where I would want to eat my dinner.
427.908,430.179,I'm feeling a nice thin layer of
430.179,431.382,perspiration.
431.382,433.187,A lingering heat.
433.187,434.755,Where I feel like if I breath
434.755,435.942,I can light a candle.
435.942,437.258,It's honestly about at the same spice
437.258,439.468,as the Keith's chicken sauce.
439.468,440.574,And now we are going to level three
440.574,442.896,which is the most popular spice level
442.896,444.831,that's ordered at this restaurant.
444.831,446.389,"Hey guys, I've got level three right here."
446.389,448.212,This gonna be our house standard level.
448.212,449.161,House standard.
449.161,449.994,House standard.
449.994,451.66,Meaning if you can't handle this you're weak.
451.66,452.533,Oh wow. It smells more intense.
452.533,454.469,I'm really smelling the floral notes of the
454.469,456.062,peppercorn now.
456.062,457.331,I feel like we're like pre-gaming.
457.331,459.333,And we're taking more and more shots
459.333,460.684,and we're getting drunker
460.684,461.517,It does feel like we're gonna go out to a party
461.517,462.739,where we have noodles later.
462.739,466.123,By the time we get to the party we'll be pretty bust.
466.123,468.979,We'll be spicied out.
468.979,470.084,Ah so good.
470.084,471.475,That's spicy.
471.475,472.935,"Alright, this is the last round"
472.935,474.136,before ghost peppers.
474.136,475.1,Let's enjoy.
475.1,476.249,Let's enjoy this final moment.
476.249,478.007,Let's try to enjoy it.
478.007,478.84,Cheers.
478.84,481.34,In the eye of the hurricane.
486.511,487.562,It's still delicious.
487.562,488.813,A lot of times spice
488.813,490.485,reaches a place where
490.485,493.284,you no longer can taste or feel.
493.284,494.957,This still has tremendous flavor.
494.957,496.378,My nose is starting to run a little bit.
496.378,497.211,Which is great.
497.211,498.209,I've been a little congested.
498.209,500.457,I feel like I'm in an Uber right now going to a party
501.29,502.123,and you know when you
502.123,502.956,are kinda like tipsy
502.956,503.789,and you're talking a lot.
503.789,504.622,How long have you lived in LA?
504.622,505.556,What part of LA are you in?
505.556,507.477,"Oh cool yeah, I don't know where that is."
507.477,509.916,Yeah this makes me excited to talk
509.916,511.156,to strangers.
511.156,512.387,"Gotta tell you right now,"
512.387,513.556,It taste the most delicious.
513.556,514.722,It taste really good.
514.722,515.66,I'm starting to feel a little bit of the
515.66,517.54,"a little bit of the ""Hey."""
517.54,520.337,"I'm starting to be ""Woo"" over here."
520.337,521.81,Starting to sweat a little bit.
521.81,523.209,"Starting to sweat, feeling good."
523.209,526.026,I feel a bit of heat building in my body.
526.026,527.369,Behind my skin but
527.369,528.202,I don't feel my mouth.
528.202,529.175,Behind your skin?
529.175,530.842,"Yeah, you know when you're like"
530.842,532.372,ingesting really spicy food.
532.372,533.561,The ghost behind him.
536.534,537.474,So very warm.
537.474,539.391,My body's getting warm.
540.338,541.936,"Yeah, we're getting some water works"
541.936,542.769,over here.
542.769,545.982,Can I get a water works checked?
545.982,547.814,That wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be.
547.814,548.647,Easy buckets.
548.647,550.557,Maybe I'll beat YB.
550.557,552.33,But I think after this is when it really takes off.
552.33,553.163,Right?
553.163,554.362,"Yeah, we're about to enter ghost pepper town."
556.293,557.282,"Yeah, we're ready for the next one."
557.282,559.47,"Alright guys, we got level four right here."
559.47,562.527,This is gonna be where our spicy challenge starts to begin.
562.527,564.08,It's from here that we started adding
564.08,565.027,our ghost peppers.
565.027,566.825,So be very careful. Oh wow. It's smells.
566.825,567.658,Smell it.
567.658,569.324,"Can you smell it? Oh yeah, I can smell it."
569.324,570.157,Oh wow.
570.157,571.384,It's gonna be a linear progression
571.384,572.813,from zero to three.
572.813,574.235,"But from four, five and six it's"
574.235,575.307,gonna be an exponential growth.
575.307,577.088,So be ready.
577.088,579.441,So it does it like this and then like that.
579.441,580.87,"Yeah, It just goes straight up."
580.87,582.537,They say this is a religious experience.
582.537,584.152,I can feel it in my temples.
584.152,585.434,Okay should we do this?
585.434,586.984,Did you guys get it?
586.984,587.944,Oh I get it.
587.944,589.111,I just got it.
589.948,591.953,Did you get it Ned? Oh yeah I got it earlier
591.953,592.877,But you didn't laugh.
592.877,593.812,But I didn't like it.
593.812,595.075,Thank you.
595.075,595.908,Cheers.
595.908,596.741,Cheers.
596.741,597.574,I might only get one bite here
597.574,598.637,so I'm just gonna go for it.
603.414,604.381,Whoa.
604.381,605.776,Oh yeah.
605.776,606.616,Oh yeah.
606.616,607.666,There she is.
607.666,609.249,"Okay, I taste it."
613.71,614.543,Oh wow.
614.543,615.376,Oh.
617.953,618.872,This got shivers.
618.872,620.186,"You described your food as painful,"
620.186,621.909,spicy and delicious.
621.909,623.229,Why painful?
623.229,625.126,Well that pain really does release
625.126,626.32,those endorphins.
626.32,628.96,"And that creates that euphoric effect, Right?"
628.96,631.508,"Okay, so we might experience euphoria today."
631.508,632.341,You are.
632.341,634.249,"Zendaya, that's where we're gonna be at."
634.249,636.008,Is is Zendaya? I thought it's Zandaya?
636.008,637.674,Zendaya? I thought it was Zendaya?
637.674,638.54,Zendaya?
638.54,640.129,"Zendaya, right?"
640.129,641.072,"It's Zendaya, right?"
641.072,642.249,From the big foot movie?
642.249,643.202,I see like
643.202,645.969,I see like the end of Zendaya's dress.
645.969,647.541,Like I see her turning a corner.
647.541,650.545,This is when it's hard to breath out.
650.545,652.062,"It's not like just ""Oh that's hot.""."
652.062,653.162,"It's like ""Oh it hurts.""."
653.162,654.168,But I do want more.
654.168,655.433,It's really good.
655.433,657.509,Oh my god this is sending me places.
657.509,658.946,Wow this is a trip.
658.946,660.266,And it lingers a lot.
660.266,661.099,It's not going away.
661.099,662.147,It's like in my gums.
662.147,665.054,Oh the water taste crazy. My tongue is like
665.054,666.264,vibrating
666.264,668.307,from the water.
668.307,669.14,I'm sweaty.
669.14,670.279,You're sweaty.
670.279,671.71,I'm sweating but it feels good like
671.71,673.377,I'm kinda turned on.
675.09,676.034,"Well of course, I think it's fair to say"
676.034,676.867,we're all kind of turned on.
676.867,677.7,It's like an Asian proverb.
677.7,679.917,I don't think it's fair to say that.
679.917,682.025,You guys know the old Asian proverb
682.025,683.27,"that says like "" The most fun you can have"
683.27,684.938,"outside the bedroom is the spice challenge.""."
684.938,686.844,That's probably where I would stop.
686.844,688.23,"Yeah, this would be optimum spice level if"
688.23,689.898,I'm like looking to have a good time.
689.898,690.879,I feel like a pop star.
690.879,692.545,You look crazy right now. What's happening?
692.545,694.882,I feel like a pop star who's taking her solo.
694.882,698.349,I wanna feel like what
698.349,699.747,You're starting to cry.
699.747,701.669,I wanna feel what five feels like
701.669,704.115,but I don't think I can go past five.
704.115,705.841,Even now my mouth is hot.
705.841,707.494,I feel like very euphoric.
707.494,708.327,I feel like
708.327,709.383,"Hey, let's go to a party."
709.383,710.503,Which party should we go to?
710.503,711.336,I don't know.
711.336,712.169,Let's talk about it.
712.169,713.002,Let's think about.
713.002,714.668,Let's talk about it. What's really cute for me right now
714.668,715.672,is I have simultaneous tears.
715.672,716.827,And they're like at the same place
716.827,717.944,in each eye.
717.944,719.337,"They're like ""Yes.""."
719.337,720.46,Let's move up.
720.46,721.293,Really?
721.293,722.126,Let's go.
722.126,722.959,Ready?
722.959,724.367,Let's go for it.
724.367,725.625,Level five.
725.625,726.945,Level five.
726.945,729.011,So I got level five right here for you guys.
729.011,729.844,"As you can see,"
729.844,732.879,It's gonna be a lot more of a dense red color.
732.879,734.104,All that peppering is the sansho.
734.104,735.198,It's the sansho and the ghost pepper.
735.198,736.031,Wow.
737.36,738.299,Fantastic.
738.299,739.303,I gotta say
739.303,740.738,I'm starting to get a little nervous
740.738,741.621,about this one.
741.621,743.091,If that one's a four and this
743.091,744.403,one's a five.
744.403,747.363,And they said it gets exponentially crazier.
747.363,748.673,Oh that's true.
748.673,750.198,This one you can actually smell
750.198,752.097,the spice wafting off of this dish.
752.097,753.427,Which is incredible.
753.427,754.26,Cheers.
754.26,755.093,Cheers.
755.093,755.926,Clingky-clingk.
755.926,756.759,Cheers.
757.984,759.032,Here we go.
771.605,772.438,Oh my god.
775.984,776.959,Oh my god.
778.313,779.685,Oh yeah.
779.685,783.102,There's a deep under current in this one.
784.558,786.103,We got a round house kick.
786.103,788.691,A tongue slap and then
788.691,790.274,You're getting a little moist on the face.
790.274,791.172,Yeah.
791.172,792.881,I'm feeling it.
792.881,793.724,It's good.
793.724,794.967,It's tasty.
794.967,796.327,Oh that's real good spice.
796.327,797.593,Oh my god.
797.593,799.53,Freaking good.
799.53,801.109,The taste is still very good.
801.109,803.017,Yeah it's a different experience now.
803.017,804.434,It's painful now.
805.958,807.796,Swirling around.
807.796,808.724,You know those spinners that you put
808.724,810.834,the salad in and you press the button.
810.834,812.67,Feels like someone is doing that to my brain.
812.67,813.503,Salad spinner.
813.503,814.336,Salad spinner?
814.336,815.169,That's what they call it?
815.169,816.002,How 'bout that?
816.002,817.217,What a straight forward name.
819.594,821.381,I'm ascending.
821.381,823.007,I'm a ghost.
823.007,824.074,"Oh wow, oh wow."
824.074,825.324,Are you okay?
835.329,837.776,His face is so close to me.
837.776,839.561,"That's like the right type of painful, you know?"
839.561,840.394,No.
841.448,842.533,You're wet.
843.53,844.925,There's an old Asian proverb that says
844.925,845.758,"""You're food isn't good if"
845.758,846.962,"you're not sweating buckets.""."
846.962,848.72,There's an old Jewish proverb that goes
848.72,849.577,"""Oy.""."
853.38,855.046,"That's yeah, I'm gonna have to tap out here."
857.505,858.422,Proud of you Keith.
858.422,859.71,I want a popsicle please.
862.965,863.798,Cool down that brain fire.
863.798,864.764,Yeah.
864.764,867.162,It's so good though wish I could eat more.
867.162,868.303,It is really good.
868.303,870.163,I want to keep going.
870.163,871.446,I fear that it is personally
871.446,873.209,irresponsible and reckless for me to
873.209,874.529,even attempt another bite.
875.362,876.626,I can't believe I made it this far.
876.626,877.724,This is spectacular
877.724,878.904,but this is all I can handle.
878.904,879.757,Wow.
879.757,881.637,The heats starting to travel to the outside
881.637,882.47,of my mouth.
882.47,883.303,Like on my face.
883.303,884.136,Are you okay?
884.136,885.38,I think I got the noodles on my face.
885.38,887.046,Oh no. I'm very proud of you Alexandria.
887.046,890.025,I'm like truly wildly impress with how
890.025,890.858,well you are doing
890.858,892.107,"Thank you, just gotta beat YB."
893.361,894.833,Oh yeah.
894.833,895.666,Are you guys gonna go to six?
895.666,896.499,You gonna go for it?
896.499,897.332,"Oh yeah, let's go."
897.332,898.973,Let's do this.
898.973,899.806,Aw.
900.775,901.608,"Alright guys, got the level six right here."
901.608,905.3,As you can see it's gonna be a much more black color.
905.3,907.718,The hottest level they have on the menu.
907.718,911.339,And we are going to try to finish our full bowl of
911.339,913.359,"level six, otherwise you tap out."
913.359,914.698,And I brought some ghost peppers just
914.698,916.153,in case you wanna do it.
916.153,917.028,Wow.
917.028,917.861,Wow.
917.861,919.085,Yes.
919.085,920.708,'Bout to off-road it.
920.708,921.837,My scalp is sweating.
921.837,923.656,You know when you work out and
923.656,926.033,just your head is really wet. That's where I am right now.
926.033,928.484,"Wow, look at that. That looks so scary."
928.484,929.667,"Alexandria, someone who has failed"
929.667,931.822,almost exclusively for the past six years.
931.822,933.753,You can still get really far in life.
933.753,935.622,"I own a company, I make videos,"
935.622,937.807,I'm arguably equally as popular as
937.807,939.117,the other guys.
939.117,939.95,You know?
939.95,941.617,You could fail all the way to the top.
941.617,942.45,I do agree.
942.45,943.528,This is the one thing I needed to do.
943.528,944.529,And then I'm quitting my job.
947.177,948.01,Cheers.
948.01,948.843,Cheers.
948.843,949.676,Cheers.
953.635,954.468,Keep going
954.468,955.635,Don't give up.
961.396,962.229,Whoa.
966.004,966.971,Oh my god.
966.971,967.804,Oh yeah.
970.886,972.108,Do not get this on a date.
977.603,979.29,This is the first one I actually feel
979.29,981.931,the spice go down my esophagus. The way I'm gonna beat YB is
981.931,983.764,I'm only having water.
985.416,987.418,"It's got a kick to it, you know?"
987.418,988.733,I feel like I just went to a dentist
988.733,990.312,they numbed my tongue.
990.312,992.503,"Oh yeah, my mouth is just drooling."
992.503,994.169,Same. Let's go. Let's go back in.
994.169,995.017,You got this girl.
995.017,996.326,Don't give up now.
996.326,998.61,I will say you aren't the waterfall that
998.61,999.97,Eugene is right now.
999.97,1000.934,That is so
1000.934,1001.767,Oh my god.
1001.767,1002.684,So spicy.
1003.898,1005.733,"It's like that ""Key and Peele"" episode"
1005.733,1006.736,we're his just sweating balls.
1006.736,1009.65,So spicy but it makes me feel so good.
1009.65,1011.198,You should open up early on Sunday
1011.198,1012.636,and call it Sunday service.
1012.636,1014.021,And let people see God.
1014.021,1015.677,Oh boy.
1015.677,1017.517,My tongue is made up of metal.
1017.517,1018.6,"Clang, clang."
1020.604,1023.009,This like swallowing fire and hell.
1023.009,1025.997,It's literally like lava is going down
1025.997,1026.83,my belly.
1027.982,1030.668,I feel like I'm seeing a whole another level
1030.668,1032.283,of spirituality
1032.283,1034.599,"Oh no , don't wipe your eyes."
1034.599,1035.851,Well.
1035.851,1037.112,Starting to get full.
1037.112,1037.945,I'm full too.
1037.945,1038.794,I'm really full.
1038.794,1039.627,I'm not full.
1039.627,1041.293,"See, I wish I wish you had my stomach"
1041.293,1042.126,and I have your mouth.
1042.126,1043.792,"Oh no. now we would just be both be it,"
1043.792,1045.542,it would be mixed up.
1046.985,1049.73,"I'm really, really, not doing good."
1049.73,1052.251,I'm debating whether to finish or not.
1052.251,1054.052,I don't know if I can.
1054.052,1054.97,I'm officially tapping out.
1057.992,1059.436,As Zack advised I'm gonna quit.
1059.436,1060.584,I think I did pretty good.
1060.584,1061.417,You did well.
1061.417,1062.547,You've been amazing.
1062.547,1063.683,I can't anymore.
1063.683,1064.516,"Wow, way to go."
1064.516,1065.349,Way to go Alexandria.
1065.349,1066.182,I will say
1066.182,1067.596,what is limiting me right now
1067.596,1069.877,is my stomach volume.
1069.877,1074.02,So I am going to take a pinch of the ghost pepper.
1074.02,1074.899,What?
1074.899,1075.732,And count...
1076.565,1077.81,"No, Ned."
1077.81,1080.736,I'm making my own challenge YB.
1080.736,1081.784,Ned loves bad ideas.
1081.784,1083.953,Don't use your fingers.
1083.953,1085.674,Oh my god.
1085.674,1086.507,"Yes, yes Ned."
1086.507,1087.723,Don't back down now.
1090.249,1091.216,Oh my god.
1097.669,1099.169,What do you see?
1103.641,1105.264,I wanna get further away.
1106.574,1107.878,Euphoria!
1110.616,1112.993,I feel like I'm looking through
1112.993,1114.804,a kaleidoscope right now.
1114.804,1118.284,My entire vision is just doing this.
1118.284,1119.601,"Click, click."
1121.226,1123.559,I'll have what I'm having.
1124.44,1125.362,Are you gonna finish it?
1125.362,1127.397,I have to beat YB. Don't know if she's gonna be
1127.397,1128.442,at the same place as me.
1128.442,1130.996,I just died. But if I finish this that means YB has to
1130.996,1132.042,finish the whole bowl.
1132.042,1133.573,You can do it YB.
1133.573,1135.141,We believe in you.
1135.141,1136.205,"Wow, wow."
1136.205,1138.137,"You're a hero, you're a hero."
1138.137,1139.501,Show us what you got.
1139.501,1141.809,"YB, this is for you."
1141.809,1144.091,"Go Eugene, go."
1147.391,1148.224,I'm done.
1148.224,1149.057,Okay.
1149.057,1149.89,There's no more noodles.
1149.89,1150.723,Alright.
1151.923,1153.582,"Look at him, look at him."
1153.582,1155.619,"Eugene, YB and Ned all surpassed"
1155.619,1157.042,all expectations.
1157.042,1159.112,Ned did exactly what we thought he'd do
1159.112,1160.912,though with making a terrible decision.
1161.89,1162.723,I don't like
1162.723,1166.069,I just run a marathon and made love
1166.069,1167.367,at the same time.
1167.367,1169.95,Like I need cigarette and I don't smoke.
1169.95,1171.316,"Well, I'm proud of us."
1171.316,1174.103,All of us got passed level five.
1174.103,1175.016,Yeah.
1175.016,1176.748,Zendaya is me.
1176.748,1179.151,And you have reached chi.
1179.151,1180.447,Bravo to the team at Killer Noodle.
1180.447,1183.115,You guys have made a spectacular product.
1183.115,1184.434,There's some in here for everybody.
1184.434,1187.227,"It truly is painful, delicious,"
1187.227,1188.06,and spicy.
1195.55,1196.913,That is equilibrium.
1196.913,1198.266,Everything is Math.
1198.266,1200.023,A perfect amount of both spices.
1200.023,1202.082,"The stinging spice, the numbing spice."
1202.082,1202.915,Ah.
