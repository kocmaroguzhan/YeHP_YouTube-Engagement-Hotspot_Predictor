20,25,Good
25,30,morning . It has been quite a
30,35,privilege being able to grow up in two quite
35,40,different ways of life . I was born in
40,45,"Germany , and at the same time had the chance to learn more"
45,50,about an ancient art coming from the Shaolin Temple . When you
50,55,"grow up in an Asian family , it is quite common that firstly ,"
55,60,"you do n't argue with your father , and secondly ,"
60,65,"you either become medical doctor , engineer ,"
65,70,or lawyer . Elsewise your parents will be
70,75,very unhappy . So having that
75,80,"said , I finished my academic education with"
80,85,"two university degrees , an MBA , and"
85,90,quite a collection of different certificates and diplomas -
90,95,everything that my parents thought would be useful to have .
95,100,"But throughout this education ,"
100,105,I felt something was missing .
105,110,Because I was learning about many different aspects -
110,115,"how the plant is working , what an atom is"
115,120,"made out of , how a political system is functioning ,"
120,125,"but somehow , the subject was missing to"
125,130,learn something about myself .
130,135,"So with the age of four , for the first time I got introduced"
135,140,"into the monastic practices , and I was"
140,145,very happy to find out that the main part of these practices
145,150,were dealing with the exploration and the discovery
150,155,of yourself . There was mental
155,160,"training , development of behavior"
160,165,"combined with the physical training , all aspects of"
165,170,what nowadays is known as Shaolin Kung - Fu .
170,175,"Now , despite the wishes of my parents to somehow go out in"
175,180,"the market and try to manage the world ,"
180,185,I decided to continue this
185,190,monastic life and start learning more
190,195,"about myself first . Now , in the"
195,200,"preparation for this talk , I was asked to"
200,205,share a few words on what is
205,210,"important in this lifetime , and see ,"
210,215,it 's already challenging
215,220,to put three decades into a single talk .
220,225,But the picture I would like to
225,230,show you summarizes very much
230,235,what I consider as being valuable in this
235,240,lifetime . There is something
240,245,about sharing with others . There
245,250,is something about connection . There is the training and
250,255,"development of yourself . It is to enjoy your time , even doing"
255,260,nothing . And one main aspect is
260,265,to find a way to find a way and do the things you
265,270,"like to do . Now , when I received the"
270,275,"invitation to have a talk at today 's event , especially under the"
275,280,"slogan "" High , Higher , Highest , "" something very"
280,285,"particular came up on my mind , and a"
285,290,master from the Shaolin Temple once
290,295,told me a story that I would like to share with you .
300,305,"A man was living close to a mountain , and every"
305,310,day he was thinking : How would it be to climb
310,315,that mountain and what would I see on the peak ? So
315,320,"finally , the day came , and the man went on the journey ."
320,325,"Arriving at the foot of the mountain , he met the"
325,330,"first traveler . So he asked , "" How did"
330,335,"you get up the mountain , and what did you see from the top ? "" And so the"
335,340,"traveler shared his path , and also the view that he had ."
340,345,"But then the man was thinking , "" The way"
345,350,that this traveler described to me sounds very exhausting .
350,355,"I need to find another way to climb . "" So he continued to"
355,360,walk on the foot of the mountain until he met the next traveler . So
360,365,"once again he asked , "" How did you climb up that mountain ,"
365,370,"and what did you see from the top ? "" And so again the"
370,375,traveler shared his story . Still not being
375,380,"determined on which direction and which way to go ,"
380,385,"the man asked 30 more people , 30 more travelers ."
385,390,"When he finished talking to all of them , he finally made up"
390,395,"his mind . "" Now that so many people already shared with me their paths and"
395,400,"especially what they all saw from the top , I do n't need to"
400,405,"climb there anymore . "" It is very unfortunate this"
405,410,"man never went on the journey . Now , to"
410,415,"conclude this story , firstly ,"
415,420,each individual needs to find the
420,425,most suitable way to climb that mountain .
425,430,"But secondly , there is information"
430,435,"possible to be shared with words ,"
435,440,but it is impossible to share
440,445,the experience of clarity when you are standing
445,450,on that peak by yourself . To
450,455,invest the right effort in
455,460,"climbing that peak , it 's very much"
460,465,"what all the Buddhist practices , the"
465,470,"Shaolin training , or any spiritual"
470,475,practice is about . Clarity means
475,480,"you see more clear . When you see more clear ,"
480,485,interrelations become more apparent . When you see more
485,490,"clear , there is no need to believe anyone or"
490,495,believe anything . Seeing clear means
495,500,you can distinguish for yourself which is the proper
500,505,direction to take and which decisions do I have to
505,510,make in order to make my goals or
510,515,"aspirations start to shape ? Now , at today 's talk , you will have"
515,520,the chance to become inspired by quite a lot of
520,525,"different travelers . But in this particular talk , I ca"
525,530,"n't , and I wo n't tell you which way to go ."
530,535,It 's just that along your
535,540,"personal journey , you will"
540,545,encounter challenges . Those challenges
545,550,"will either prevent you , or some of them even stop you ,"
550,555,from moving on and climbing that mountain .
555,560,"In the Shaolin Temple , we refer to them as """
560,565,"the five hindrances . """
565,570,The five hindrances are describing different states of the mind .
570,575,"In those states of the mind , it"
575,580,becomes very hard to see clearly and therefore
580,585,engage in the right decisions . The first hindrance is
585,590,"called "" sensual desire . "" Sensual desire arises in"
590,595,the moment when you are paying attention to something that is
595,600,giving you a positive emotion . This
600,605,positive emotion can originate from five gates of your body :
605,610,"Seeing , hearing , smelling ,"
610,615,"tasting , or feeling . So in your mind ,"
615,620,you climb up that mountain .
620,625,"After one mile of walking , you discover a beautiful"
625,630,restaurant surrounded by beautiful
630,635,people . You smell delicious food and the great
635,640,"variety of beverages . When you follow that temptation ,"
640,645,you have already lost your track . When
645,650,this temptation becomes so strong that you do n't
650,655,"want to leave that place anymore , then the sensual"
655,660,desire has turned into an obsession .
660,665,"In both cases , remaining at that place means"
665,670,that you ca n't get clarity . The second
670,675,"hindrance , "" ill - will , "" describes the state of the mind"
675,680,that arises from negative emotions . In
680,685,"that state of the mind , you have an aversion , a"
685,690,"rejection , or simply a dislike against"
690,695,"either an object , a situation , or can be even a person ."
695,700,"To simplify , it means : You are"
700,705,"climbing the mountain , and it starts to rain , but you"
705,710,do n't like rain . You discover the roads are
710,715,"bumpy , but you do n't like bumpy roads . In order to"
715,720,"cross the river , you need to swim , but you do n’t like swimming ."
720,725,"Whatever it is that you dislike , it wo n’t make it a"
725,730,pleasant journey unless you learn to let go
730,735,of this ill - will . It ’s more likely even that you wo n't continue
735,740,"that journey . The third hindrance originally translated as """
740,745,"sloth and torpor . "" "" Sloth "" means it ’s the heaviness of the body . "" Torpor """
745,750,means it ’s the dullness of the mind . It is characterized
750,755,"by sleepiness , non - motivation , lack"
755,760,"of energy , and oftentimes can manifest"
760,765,itself in a state of depression .
765,770,"Now , a simile used in Buddhism describes it as "" imprisonment . """
770,775,You find yourself locked in a cell .
775,780,It becomes very hard to make any type of mental or
780,785,"physical effort . So in order to continue your path ,"
785,790,there is only one option left . You need to find a way to get
790,795,"out from that hole , from that cell . Now , the fourth"
795,800,"hindrance is called "" restlessness . "" It is the"
800,805,"state of an unsettled mind . "" Unsettle mind "" means"
805,810,your mind can not settle . Settle where ? Settle in
810,815,the present moment . An unsettled mind either is
815,820,worrying about the future or traveling into the past
820,825,"and rejecting , judging about an"
825,830,event that happened into your past . A simile used
830,835,"here is the monkey mind , constantly jumping from one"
835,840,"branch to another , unable to stay for too long time at the"
840,845,present moment . The problem is there is
845,850,"no time to see clearly anymore . Now , the"
850,855,"last of the five hindrances is called "" skeptical doubt , "" and it 's very"
855,860,closely related to a state of mind which is based on
860,865,indecisiveness . It is very easy in that state of mind
865,870,getting lost in thoughts . Can I do this ? Is
870,875,this the right path ? What will the others say ? What if
875,880,this ? What if that ? The mind can not synchronize with your own actions anymore .
880,885,And the result is that you are getting disconnected with the
885,890,goals and aspirations that once you have set to yourself . When the
890,895,"way is filled with too much doubts , more often you will stop"
895,900,instead of moving on . That
900,905,"we know the five hindrances now , what are we"
905,910,going to do about them ? You need
910,915,to align and structure your life in such a way
915,920,to prevent those hindrances from
920,925,"arising . If you are not successful ,"
925,930,you need to use techniques in order to remove
930,935,them . Each of these hindrances is placing
935,940,"the dark cloud on your mind , or on the way of"
940,945,your climb . Simply remember one thing :
945,950,Just let it rain .
950,955,This is a four step method
955,960,to help you removing those hindrances . The
960,965,first step is recognize in what state of the mind you are
965,970,finding yourself in .
970,975,"Afterwards , learn to accept , acknowledge , and"
975,980,allow the situation or a person to be the way how
980,985,"it is , to be the way how they are ."
985,990,"Investigate your emotional and mental state , and ask questions :"
990,995,Why did it come up ?
995,1000,What is going to be the consequence if I remain in that state ?
1000,1005,"And ultimately , non - identification means :"
1005,1010,It is the practice . I am
1010,1015,not the body . I
1015,1020,am not the mind . I am
1020,1025,not my emotion . It 's just
1025,1030,that I can see all these three aspects about me .
1035,1040,"All of our lifetimes ,"
1040,1045,all of our lives are too
1045,1050,unique to copy the path from
1050,1055,someone else .
1055,1060,"To bring meaning to your life ,"
1060,1065,"to bring value into your life , you"
1065,1070,"need to learn and master yourself , and do n't let the"
1070,1075,hindrances stop you . If any of you
1075,1080,chooses to climb that path to
1080,1085,"clarity , I would be very happy to meet you"
1085,1090,at the peak .
