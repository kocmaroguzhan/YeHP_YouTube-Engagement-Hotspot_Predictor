Transcriber: Yunhan Jiang
Reviewer: Rhonda Jacobs

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:25.622
Good morning.

00:00:25.622 --> 00:00:27.226
(Ethereal music)

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:30.154
It has been quite a privilege

00:00:30.154 --> 00:00:36.533
being able to grow up
in two quite different ways of life.

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:40.443
I was born in Germany,

00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:43.865
and at the same time had the chance

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:48.903
to learn more about an ancient art
coming from the Shaolin Temple.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.711
When you grow up in an Asian family,

00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:53.489
it is quite common

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.911
that firstly, you don't argue
with your father,

00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:03.312
and secondly, you either
become medical doctor,

00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:06.309
engineer, or lawyer.

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:11.530
Elsewise your parents
will be very unhappy.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.768
So having that said,

00:01:16.247 --> 00:01:21.830
I finished my academic education
with two university degrees,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.390
an MBA,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.388
and quite a collection
of different certificates and diplomas -

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:34.734
everything that my parents thought
would be useful to have.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:38.601
But throughout this education,

00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:42.687
I felt something was missing.

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:49.789
Because I was learning
about many different aspects -

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:52.682
how the plant is working,

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:55.628
what an atom is made out of,

00:01:56.211 --> 00:01:59.123
how a political system is functioning,

00:02:00.063 --> 00:02:03.657
but somehow, the subject was missing

00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:07.915
to learn something about myself.

00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:12.127
So with the age of four,

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:13.441
for the first time

00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:17.647
I got introduced
into the monastic practices,

00:02:18.927 --> 00:02:25.060
and I was very happy to find out
that the main part of these practices

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.009
were dealing with the exploration
and the discovery of yourself.

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:35.284
There was mental training,

00:02:36.926 --> 00:02:43.183
development of behavior
combined with the physical training,

00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:48.546
all aspects of what nowadays 
is known as Shaolin Kung-Fu.

00:02:50.716 --> 00:02:52.786
Now, despite the wishes of my parents

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:58.853
to somehow go out in the market
and try to manage the world,

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.699
I decided to continue this monastic life

00:03:06.768 --> 00:03:12.006
and start learning more
about myself first.

00:03:13.487 --> 00:03:17.237
Now, in the preparation for this talk,

00:03:17.237 --> 00:03:22.358
I was asked to share a few words on

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.424
what is important in this lifetime,

00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:29.387
and see,

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.719
it's already challenging

00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:39.691
to put three decades into a single talk.

00:03:41.544 --> 00:03:45.684
But the picture I would like to show you

00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:48.971
summarizes very much

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:55.254
what I consider
as being valuable in this lifetime.

00:03:57.408 --> 00:04:02.626
There is something
about sharing with others.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.922
There is something about connection.

00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:11.261
There is the training
and development of yourself.

00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:15.681
It is to enjoy your time,
even doing nothing.

00:04:16.093 --> 00:04:18.790
And one main aspect is

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.474
to find a way

00:04:22.177 --> 00:04:25.547
and do the things you like to do.

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:30.499
Now, when I received the invitation

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:33.045
to have a talk at today's event,

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:37.329
especially under the slogan
"High, Higher, Highest,"

00:04:38.087 --> 00:04:42.972
something very particular
came up on my mind,

00:04:43.352 --> 00:04:48.449
and a master from the Shaolin Temple

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:55.325
once told me a story
that I would like to share with you.

00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:58.716
(Flute music)

00:05:00.787 --> 00:05:03.196
A man was living close to a mountain,

00:05:03.766 --> 00:05:06.522
and every day he was thinking:

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:11.006
How would it be to climb that mountain

00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:13.526
and what would I see on the peak?

00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:20.464
So finally, the day came, 
and the man went on the journey.

00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:24.019
Arriving at the foot of the mountain,

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:26.037
he met the first traveler.

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.459
So he asked,

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.939
"How did you get up the mountain,
and what did you see from the top?"

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.299
And so the traveler shared his path,

00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:38.749
and also the view that he had.

00:05:40.053 --> 00:05:42.363
But then the man was thinking,

00:05:44.113 --> 00:05:49.178
"The way that this traveler described
to me sounds very exhausting.

00:05:50.158 --> 00:05:52.713
I need to find another way to climb."

00:05:53.751 --> 00:05:56.623
So he continued to walk
on the foot of the mountain

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:59.116
until he met the next traveler.

00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:01.504
So once again he asked,

00:06:02.244 --> 00:06:04.747
"How did you climb up that mountain,

00:06:05.087 --> 00:06:07.520
and what did you see from the top?"

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.550
And so again the traveler
shared his story.

00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:18.230
Still not being determined
on which direction and which way to go,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.910
the man asked 30 more people,
30 more travelers.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.200
When he finished talking to all of them,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.578
he finally made up his mind.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.650
"Now that so many people
already shared with me their paths

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.730
and especially what
they all saw from the top,

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.311
I don't need to climb there anymore."

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.990
It is very unfortunate

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.494
this man never went on the journey.

00:06:49.127 --> 00:06:51.705
Now, to conclude this story,

00:06:53.257 --> 00:06:54.492
firstly,

00:06:55.862 --> 00:07:01.500
each individual needs to find
the most suitable way

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.777
to climb that mountain.

00:07:05.754 --> 00:07:09.841
But secondly, there is information

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.537
possible to be shared with words,

00:07:14.884 --> 00:07:17.289
but it is impossible

00:07:18.993 --> 00:07:22.819
to share the experience of clarity

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:27.409
when you are standing
on that peak by yourself.

00:07:29.138 --> 00:07:33.872
To invest the right effort

00:07:34.562 --> 00:07:37.069
in climbing that peak,

00:07:38.037 --> 00:07:43.966
it's very much what
all the Buddhist practices,

00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:46.304
the Shaolin training,

00:07:47.784 --> 00:07:51.148
or any spiritual practice is about.

00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:57.357
Clarity means you see more clear.

00:07:57.687 --> 00:08:03.497
When you see more clear,
interrelations become more apparent.

00:08:03.757 --> 00:08:05.187
When you see more clear,

00:08:05.187 --> 00:08:12.117
there is no need to believe anyone
or believe anything.

00:08:13.165 --> 00:08:17.494
Seeing clear means 
you can distinguish for yourself

00:08:17.494 --> 00:08:20.720
which is the proper direction to take

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.362
and which decisions do I have to make

00:08:25.362 --> 00:08:31.923
in order to make my goals
or aspirations start to shape?

00:08:32.203 --> 00:08:35.653
Now, at today's talk,
you will have the chance

00:08:35.653 --> 00:08:41.039
to become inspired 
by quite a lot of different travelers.

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:43.844
But in this particular talk,

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:48.840
I can't, and I won't tell you
which way to go.

00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:56.768
It's just that along
your personal journey,

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:01.849
you will encounter challenges.

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:06.799
Those challenges will either prevent you,

00:09:07.139 --> 00:09:09.898
or some of them even stop you,

00:09:10.378 --> 00:09:13.632
from moving on and climbing that mountain.

00:09:15.004 --> 00:09:18.764
In the Shaolin Temple,
we refer to them

00:09:19.224 --> 00:09:23.630
as "the five hindrances."

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:31.220
The five hindrances are describing
different states of the mind.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.635
In those states of the mind,

00:09:34.635 --> 00:09:38.460
it becomes very hard to see clearly

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.488
and therefore engage
in the right decisions.

00:09:42.488 --> 00:09:46.998
The first hindrance
is called "sensual desire."

00:09:46.998 --> 00:09:51.170
Sensual desire arises in the moment

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.300
when you are paying
attention to something

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.840
that is giving you a positive emotion.

00:09:58.983 --> 00:10:04.633
This positive emotion can originate
from five gates of your body:

00:10:05.693 --> 00:10:11.750
Seeing, hearing, smelling,
tasting, or feeling.

00:10:13.117 --> 00:10:18.159
So in your mind,
you climb up that mountain.

00:10:19.631 --> 00:10:22.011
After one mile of walking,

00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:25.543
you discover a beautiful restaurant

00:10:26.913 --> 00:10:30.033
surrounded by beautiful people.

00:10:30.793 --> 00:10:36.423
You smell delicious food
and the great variety of beverages.

00:10:36.423 --> 00:10:39.103
When you follow that temptation,

00:10:40.283 --> 00:10:43.463
you have already lost your track.

00:10:44.153 --> 00:10:48.379
When this temptation becomes so strong

00:10:48.659 --> 00:10:52.170
that you don't want
to leave that place anymore,

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.820
then the sensual desire
has turned into an obsession.

00:10:59.738 --> 00:11:01.466
In both cases,

00:11:01.776 --> 00:11:07.721
remaining at that place means
that you can't get clarity.

00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:12.021
The second hindrance, "ill-will,"

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:14.835
describes the state of the mind

00:11:15.215 --> 00:11:18.645
that arises from negative emotions.

00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:21.775
In that state of the mind,

00:11:21.775 --> 00:11:28.270
you have an aversion,
a rejection, or simply a dislike

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:34.954
against either an object, a situation,
or can be even a person.

00:11:36.608 --> 00:11:38.741
To simplify, it means:

00:11:39.371 --> 00:11:41.761
You are climbing the mountain,

00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:44.051
and it starts to rain,

00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:46.307
but you don't like rain.

00:11:47.067 --> 00:11:50.268
You discover the roads are bumpy,

00:11:50.268 --> 00:11:52.816
but you don't like bumpy roads.

00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:57.266
In order to cross the river,
you need to swim,

00:11:57.266 --> 00:11:59.670
but you don’t like swimming.

00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:03.420
Whatever it is that you dislike,

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.188
it won’t make it a pleasant journey

00:12:07.671 --> 00:12:11.301
unless you learn
to let go of this ill-will.

00:12:11.301 --> 00:12:15.938
It’s more likely even
that you won't continue that journey.

00:12:16.468 --> 00:12:20.908
The third hindrance originally
translated as "sloth and torpor."

00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:23.908
"Sloth" means it’s
the heaviness of the body.

00:12:23.908 --> 00:12:27.719
"Torpor" means it’s
the dullness of the mind.

00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:31.158
It is characterized by sleepiness,

00:12:31.748 --> 00:12:33.678
non-motivation,

00:12:34.158 --> 00:12:35.980
lack of energy,

00:12:36.168 --> 00:12:40.014
and oftentimes can manifest itself

00:12:40.014 --> 00:12:44.448
in a state of depression.

00:12:44.738 --> 00:12:51.323
Now, a simile used in Buddhism
describes it as "imprisonment."

00:12:51.323 --> 00:12:54.573
You find yourself locked in a cell.

00:12:55.223 --> 00:12:56.998
It becomes very hard

00:12:56.998 --> 00:13:01.774
to make any type
of mental or physical effort.

00:13:01.774 --> 00:13:04.884
So in order to continue your path,

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:07.504
there is only one option left.

00:13:07.504 --> 00:13:12.634
You need to find a way to get out
from that hole, from that cell.

00:13:12.894 --> 00:13:18.674
Now, the fourth hindrance
is called "restlessness."

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:22.939
It is the state of an unsettled mind.

00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:26.629
"Unsettle mind" means
your mind cannot settle.

00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:28.819
(Laughter)
Settle where?

00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:31.239
Settle in the present moment.

00:13:31.469 --> 00:13:36.950
An unsettled mind
either is worrying about the future

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:39.769
or traveling into the past

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:42.295
and rejecting,

00:13:43.345 --> 00:13:47.985
judging about an event
that happened into your past.

00:13:48.255 --> 00:13:52.072
A simile used here is the monkey mind,

00:13:52.482 --> 00:13:55.805
constantly jumping
from one branch to another,

00:13:55.805 --> 00:14:00.768
unable to stay for too long time
at the present moment.

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:08.130
The problem is there is no time
to see clearly anymore.

00:14:09.374 --> 00:14:13.374
Now, the last of the five hindrances
is called "skeptical doubt,"

00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:18.128
and it's very closely related
to a state of mind

00:14:18.128 --> 00:14:21.490
which is based on indecisiveness.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.816
It is very easy in that state of mind
getting lost in thoughts.

00:14:27.036 --> 00:14:28.823
Can I do this?

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.034
Is this the right path?

00:14:32.034 --> 00:14:34.009
What will the others say?

00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:36.171
What if this? What if that?

00:14:36.171 --> 00:14:39.951
The mind cannot synchronize
with your own actions anymore.

00:14:39.951 --> 00:14:41.877
And the result is

00:14:41.877 --> 00:14:44.277
that you are getting disconnected

00:14:44.277 --> 00:14:49.062
with the goals and aspirations 
that once you have set to yourself.

00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:52.318
When the way is filled
with too much doubts,

00:14:52.318 --> 00:14:56.510
more often you will stop
instead of moving on.

00:14:59.551 --> 00:15:02.585
That we know the five hindrances now,

00:15:04.032 --> 00:15:06.451
what are we going to do about them?

00:15:08.853 --> 00:15:15.153
You need to align and structure
your life in such a way

00:15:16.227 --> 00:15:20.676
to prevent those hindrances from arising.

00:15:21.485 --> 00:15:23.925
If you are not successful,

00:15:25.946 --> 00:15:30.328
you need to use techniques
in order to remove them.

00:15:30.968 --> 00:15:37.883
Each of these hindrances is placing
the dark cloud on your mind,

00:15:38.008 --> 00:15:40.958
or on the way of your climb.

00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:44.438
Simply remember one thing:

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:48.401
Just let it rain.

00:15:48.401 --> 00:15:50.281
(Sound of rain)

00:15:50.281 --> 00:15:54.623
This is a four step method

00:15:55.283 --> 00:15:59.280
to help you removing those hindrances.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.300
The first step is recognize

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.606
in what state of the mind
you are finding yourself in.

00:16:06.606 --> 00:16:09.116
[Recognize, Accept,
Investigate, Non-Identity]

00:16:09.116 --> 00:16:13.946
Afterwards, learn to accept, acknowledge,

00:16:13.946 --> 00:16:17.936
and allow the situation or a person

00:16:18.096 --> 00:16:20.404
to be the way how it is,

00:16:20.404 --> 00:16:23.003
to be the way how they are.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.290
Investigate your
emotional and mental state,

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.890
and ask questions:

00:16:31.785 --> 00:16:33.677
Why did it come up?

00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:39.349
What is going to be the consequence
if I remain in that state?

00:16:41.023 --> 00:16:44.493
And ultimately, non-identification means:

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:47.426
It is the practice.

00:16:49.022 --> 00:16:51.636
I am not the body.

00:16:54.714 --> 00:16:57.519
I am not the mind.

00:16:59.328 --> 00:17:02.255
I am not my emotion.

00:17:03.586 --> 00:17:09.777
It's just that I can see
all these three aspects about me.

00:17:17.732 --> 00:17:19.795
All of our lifetimes,

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:25.219
all of our lives are too unique

00:17:26.943 --> 00:17:31.516
to copy the path from someone else.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.420
To bring meaning to your life,

00:17:40.223 --> 00:17:43.370
to bring value into your life,

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.950
you need to learn and master yourself,

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.870
and don't let the hindrances stop you.

00:17:53.116 --> 00:17:55.774
If any of you chooses

00:17:56.938 --> 00:18:00.363
to climb that path to clarity,

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:05.908
I would be very happy
to meet you at the peak.

00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:08.103
