00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:09.121
Picture this,

00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:11.579
you’re going on a boat trip,

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:15.996
and you get on board with your family, 
and you got your bags,

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:19.204
and the captain comes out
 to greet you and says,

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:24.413
“Hi, Um... My name is
Montana... Von Fliss.

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:27.704
Uh, so... I’ll be your captain
for this journey...

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:28.746
(Exhales)

00:00:28.788 --> 00:00:30.038
So, uh...

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.204
(Laughter)

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:34.662
Oh, boy... Let’s just have
a great trip. Sorry.”

00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:36.579
(Laughter)

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:39.162
Nope. Get me off of this boat.

00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:40.204
(Laughter)

00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:44.662
What we want in that moment
is for the captain to walk out and say,

00:00:44.787 --> 00:00:49.662
“Hi, my name is Montana Von Fleiss,
I’ll be your captain for this journey.

00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:51.287
Let’s have a great trip.”

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:57.162
The point is, when you are the speaker,
you are the captain for that journey,

00:00:57.246 --> 00:01:00.246
and how you show up really matters.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.412
For the last 17 years,

00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:05.621
I’ve coached thousands
of speakers all over the world,

00:01:05.663 --> 00:01:08.663
from big tech companies to small startups,

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:14.204
and everyone, from new hires
to CEOs of Fortune 500 companies,

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:18.246
want to know,
how do you show up and look confident?

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:22.371
So I’d like to share my top five tips
for how to be confident,

00:01:22.538 --> 00:01:23.913
even if you’re not.

00:01:24.413 --> 00:01:25.829
So let's break it down.

00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:28.913
What was the difference
between those two captains?

00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:30.829
What did you see? What did you hear?

00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:34.913
And not just, “One seemed nervous,
one seemed confident.”

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.371
But what was I doing differently
to make you think that?

00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:45.246
Different volume, different words,
certainly different body language.

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:50.079
But the truth is,
I wasn’t feeling particularly confident.

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:55.371
I was just making certain physical
and vocal choices to make you think that.

00:01:56.038 --> 00:01:57.413
You can do that too.

00:01:57.913 --> 00:01:59.663
Anyone can do this.

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:02.704
So, what are those
confident-looking choices?

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.413
Number one.

00:02:04.663 --> 00:02:07.454
Turn up the energy and speak up.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.413
When you speak up,
even just a little bit,

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:13.788
it reads as confident,
and you don’t have to shout.

00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:18.913
Think about it this way.
On a scale of 1 to 10, aim for a 5.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.204
Yes, it goes to 11,

00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:23.371
(Laughter)

00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:27.663
but you can just aim for a five.
I’m here at a five right now.

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.913
I can bring it back down to a three here.
Nervous captain was here.

00:02:30.954 --> 00:02:32.829
And we bring it back up to a five,

00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:36.163
and it sounds prepared,
positive, and confident.

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.704
So turn up the energy and speak up.

00:02:39.663 --> 00:02:40.913
Number two. 

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:45.246
Pause... like a boss.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.454
(Laughter)

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.246
Nervous speakers
tend to talk really fast, right?

00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:50.829
And when they do have a pause,

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.413
they fill it in
with verbal filler, likes and ums.

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:59.788
However, if you try to speak more slowly,
it just sounds like this, right?

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:00.954
And that's not better.

00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:04.413
So instead, make strategic pauses.

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.996
Pause in transition.

00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:07.871
Pause for emphasis.

00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:11.246
Pause... like a boss.

00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:12.329
(Laughter)

00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:13.788
Number three.

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:16.704
Superhero stance.

00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:21.288
Imagine you are a superhero.
You can do it from your chair.

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.079
How would a superhero sit?

00:03:23.288 --> 00:03:27.663
Yes. Let that change
your posture. I see you. Yes.

00:03:27.746 --> 00:03:31.829
Let that bring a smile to your face
and have some better eye contact.

00:03:31.913 --> 00:03:35.163
All of that reads as confident,

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.246
and pretending to be a superhero
is just a super quick way

00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:41.746
to have confident-looking body language.

00:03:42.496 --> 00:03:44.704
Now, this one also goes to 11.

00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.038
(Laughter)

00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:52.038
But you can just aim for a five,
and that will be great.

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.246
Tuck in that cape and go save the day.

00:03:56.246 --> 00:04:00.079
And you can stand in superhero backstage
to boost your confidence,

00:04:00.163 --> 00:04:04.329
but I’m saying
bring that superhero stance on stage

00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:07.621
so that your audience
sees you as confident.

00:04:08.246 --> 00:04:11.663
And if you need an easy shortcut,
just make the shape.

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.913
Just make the shape of a confident person.

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:17.829
The audience cannot read your mind.

00:04:17.913 --> 00:04:19.621
They don’t know how you’re feeling,

00:04:19.663 --> 00:04:22.913
so just make the shape
and they will go with it.

00:04:23.038 --> 00:04:25.246
Like, if you came over
to my house for dinner

00:04:25.329 --> 00:04:27.538
and I opened up the door
and I was like,

00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:30.954
“Hi, come on in, we’re having chicken.”

00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:32.038
(Laughter)

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:34.621
You’d be like, “Oh, is this a bad time?”

00:04:34.663 --> 00:04:35.954
(Laughter)

00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:38.788
You know, you’ve got to make
the shape of a good host.

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:41.829
Make the smile shape, right?

00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:44.288
Instead of crossed arm shape, open up.

00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:47.121
“Hi, welcome. Come on in.”

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:51.454
If you’re not sure if you’re making
confident-looking choices,

00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:56.204
you can just video yourself
 and watch it back.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:00.204
I feel like I just saw you say,
“Um, not doing that one.”

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:01.329
(Laughter)

00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:05.121
I know most people don’t like
to watch themselves, I get it.

00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:06.913
But wouldn’t you rather...

00:05:07.496 --> 00:05:11.704
make that adjustment
before you’re in front of your audience?

00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:13.246
Yes.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.246
Videoing yourself is
a great way to check in

00:05:16.288 --> 00:05:18.413
to see that you’re doing the techniques,

00:05:18.538 --> 00:05:21.413
but also to see
that it’s still authentically you,

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:24.371
your version of confident captain.

00:05:25.413 --> 00:05:29.996
Now, how can you do
all of these things on performance day?

00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:31.871
Number four.

00:05:32.454 --> 00:05:34.329
Practice with purpose.

00:05:34.913 --> 00:05:37.038
So, make yourself a rehearsal schedule.

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:38.704
Put it in your calendar.

00:05:38.954 --> 00:05:42.121
You can give yourself a little treat
when you do a run through.

00:05:42.704 --> 00:05:47.121
And make it practice with purpose
by giving yourself a specific goal

00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:51.871
or layering in one new
confident captain technique each day.

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:54.204
If it’s a week before your event,

00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:58.913
aim to run it all the way through
at least once a day.

00:05:59.288 --> 00:06:02.788
If you have no time for a run through,
just take the opening and closing,

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:05.288
and run that three times
in a row from anywhere.

00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:08.371
When you’re in the shower,
when you’re walking your dog,

00:06:08.413 --> 00:06:10.413
when you’re making a meal for your kids.

00:06:10.496 --> 00:06:14.996
I know my kids are very used to me walking
around the house talking to myself.

00:06:15.788 --> 00:06:19.663
Whatever you need to do
to get in those repetitions.

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:23.538
And don’t be afraid of over practice.

00:06:24.204 --> 00:06:25.704
Don't let that stop you.

00:06:26.454 --> 00:06:31.038
You can just let go of your verbatim
script if it’s starting to sound robotic.

00:06:31.246 --> 00:06:35.913
And you can still use
bullet point speaker notes

00:06:35.954 --> 00:06:38.329
to remind yourself
of what you would like to say

00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:44.121
and to invite you to say it a little bit
differently each time to keep it fresh.

00:06:44.663 --> 00:06:45.871
And let me be clear,

00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:51.413
by practice, I mean
standing up, saying it out loud,

00:06:51.454 --> 00:06:54.996
imagining your audience
and inviting them in,

00:06:55.413 --> 00:06:56.829
clicking through your slides,

00:06:56.829 --> 00:06:59.663
doing it as much
like it will be on the day,

00:06:59.663 --> 00:07:01.538
 whether it’s virtual or in person.

00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:07.996
And I know it might feel a little funny
saying it out loud to yourself,

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:12.204
but think about
when you learn a new sport,

00:07:12.288 --> 00:07:14.579
or when you practice
a musical instrument.

00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:20.121
If you had a piano concert on Friday,
and you got new music on Monday,

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:23.079
would you only read your music every day

00:07:23.204 --> 00:07:27.204
and then play it for the very first time
at the concert on Friday?

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:28.746
No way. 

00:07:28.954 --> 00:07:32.371
And yet,
I see speakers do this all the time.

00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:34.496
Give yourself a chance.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.579
Practice helps everything.

00:07:37.746 --> 00:07:42.538
And it can really boost your confidence
to practice with purpose

00:07:42.788 --> 00:07:47.163
by layering in
one new technique each day.

00:07:48.288 --> 00:07:53.579
Okay, those first four techniques,
they’re all about how to appear confident,

00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:55.621
regardless of how you’re feeling.

00:07:56.163 --> 00:08:00.413
I’ve got one more technique for you,
 and it’s a big one.

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:02.704
But this is the real gem.

00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:05.204
It's the one that makes
all the others shine.

00:08:06.163 --> 00:08:10.538
This is number five, the silent sentence.

00:08:11.496 --> 00:08:15.246
This is about
what you choose to tell yourself.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.663
I’ve been a professional actor
since I was a kid,

00:08:18.704 --> 00:08:22.788
and I have always loved
going on stage as an actor,

00:08:22.913 --> 00:08:25.329
as a speaker, as an emcee.

00:08:25.663 --> 00:08:30.454
And, at the same time,
I have often been not just nervous,

00:08:30.496 --> 00:08:36.037
sometimes downright terrified
to step on a stage.

00:08:36.746 --> 00:08:38.829
I’m shaking, I’m sweating, and I’m like,

00:08:38.912 --> 00:08:42.329
“What was I thinking?
Why do I do this to myself?”

00:08:42.454 --> 00:08:44.579
And all these unhelpful voices flood in.

00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:47.996
And I just tried to make it stop,
push it away.

00:08:48.037 --> 00:08:49.996
 And of course that never worked.

00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:54.079
And I kept going on stage
because I love it.

00:08:55.162 --> 00:08:58.287
And years later,
when I became a speaker coach,

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:01.246
I got asked to do
all these professional presentations,

00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:02.746
and they went well,

00:09:03.579 --> 00:09:08.371
but I still had no way to deal
with that massive anxiety.

00:09:08.787 --> 00:09:11.496
And I was like, “What can I do?”

00:09:11.996 --> 00:09:15.537
And I thought, “Well,
what am I telling myself?”

00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:19.371
“What if you mess up?
You better be perfect.”

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:26.996
I realized I was giving myself
an impossible instruction to be perfect.

00:09:27.787 --> 00:09:29.746
And that really was not working.

00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:33.621
But what would work?
What would be a better message?

00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:36.662
And to figure that out,
I had to go back to square one.

00:09:36.704 --> 00:09:39.121
Like, what do I want?

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:42.121
Why did I say yes to this speaking gig?

00:09:42.287 --> 00:09:44.579
What is my deeper purpose here?

00:09:45.704 --> 00:09:47.954
And I realized at the heart of it,

00:09:49.412 --> 00:09:53.746
I just want to help my audience
to the best of my ability.

00:09:55.412 --> 00:09:58.787
And when I said that,
I noticed everything change.

00:09:59.871 --> 00:10:02.996
And that's where I found
my first silent sentence.

00:10:03.204 --> 00:10:07.121
I want to help my audience
to the best of my ability.

00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:12.579
When I said it, even silently to myself,
it acted like this override switch.

00:10:12.662 --> 00:10:14.704
Like I might still be
shaking and sweating,

00:10:14.746 --> 00:10:18.371
but now I have this higher goal,
this deeper purpose,

00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:20.079
and everything aligned to that.

00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:22.329
And that became my highest priority.

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:24.454
I want to help you. 

00:10:24.662 --> 00:10:27.579
And now, that thought
replaced those unhelpful thoughts

00:10:27.621 --> 00:10:30.954
and everything went better
in my performance.

00:10:31.454 --> 00:10:37.037
And I was like, “Yes, it worked. Yay!”

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:41.871
And then I was like, “Wait,
how do I do this every time?

00:10:42.246 --> 00:10:44.412
Especially when the stakes are high.”

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:47.121
And it dawned on me,

00:10:47.204 --> 00:10:51.371
if I’m writing and crafting
the words I say out loud,

00:10:51.787 --> 00:10:55.912
why not write and craft
the words I say silently to myself?

00:10:56.079 --> 00:11:01.496
Put it in the script.
It’s the silent part of the script.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.579
So now, every time I rehearse,

00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:08.662
every time I walk onto a stage,

00:11:08.912 --> 00:11:11.496
every time I join a virtual meeting,

00:11:11.662 --> 00:11:16.162
I say the following,
new and evolved silent sentence,

00:11:17.996 --> 00:11:23.954
“I invite you to be here with me
while I am here with you

00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:29.121
so that I can make this easier for you.”

00:11:31.246 --> 00:11:35.621
Now, that invitation
to myself to be present,

00:11:36.204 --> 00:11:38.579
that’s my definition of stage presence,

00:11:38.871 --> 00:11:40.246
being present.

00:11:41.246 --> 00:11:44.829
And that invitation to the audience
to be my partner,

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:48.162
that reminds me,
these are friends, not foes.

00:11:48.204 --> 00:11:50.454
And I am choosing to be here.

00:11:50.912 --> 00:11:53.579
And now I’m not just making
the shape of a good host.

00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:59.246
I really am a good host because
I am genuinely welcoming you to my world.

00:12:01.162 --> 00:12:04.996
Now, how do you go about
finding your silent sentence?

00:12:06.412 --> 00:12:07.621
What do you want?

00:12:08.787 --> 00:12:10.621
What's your deeper purpose?

00:12:11.412 --> 00:12:15.246
You could be like me,
and you might just want to help people.

00:12:15.412 --> 00:12:17.579
Or it could be something more specific.

00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:21.662
For example, you might want
at least one person in your audience

00:12:21.704 --> 00:12:24.496
to walk out and take a CPR class.

00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:28.829
Or maybe you’re just super excited
to have this experience

00:12:28.912 --> 00:12:33.371
or share with them some cool solution
you have for their problem.

00:12:33.704 --> 00:12:38.412
You get to fill in the blank
and decide what you want to accomplish.

00:12:39.621 --> 00:12:44.079
And this is not about graduating
to some higher level of being

00:12:44.121 --> 00:12:46.454
where you never again feel nervous.

00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:49.287
Yeah, I know I haven't.

00:12:49.412 --> 00:12:52.954
I was feeling it pretty big
about 15 minutes ago

00:12:52.996 --> 00:12:54.037
(Laughter)

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:56.496
while getting ready
to walk on this stage.

00:12:56.871 --> 00:13:03.579
And I am, and probably always will be
a recovering perfectionist.

00:13:05.037 --> 00:13:08.037
That is a well-worn pathway in my brain.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.037
It is there, it exists,
it cannot be erased.

00:13:12.579 --> 00:13:15.329
But now I have this other pathway.

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:19.871
And when big moments
like this come up, I get to choose.

00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:23.579
And that's what I was doing
back there in the wings.

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:29.787
I was choosing to gently insist
on repeating my silent sentence

00:13:29.871 --> 00:13:32.412
to set myself up for success.

00:13:34.204 --> 00:13:36.912
What we tell ourselves really matters.

00:13:37.996 --> 00:13:40.329
We follow
our own instructions all day long.

00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:43.162
Our whole selves are always listening.

00:13:44.662 --> 00:13:46.912
So when you notice
something isn’t going well,

00:13:46.954 --> 00:13:50.162
or you’re fearing something
might not go well in the future,

00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:51.871
use this checklist.

00:13:53.787 --> 00:13:55.704
What am I telling myself?

00:13:56.662 --> 00:13:58.329
What's being broadcast?

00:14:00.121 --> 00:14:04.079
Then replace that with a better sentence

00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:07.371
to help set you up
for where you’d like to go.

00:14:08.204 --> 00:14:12.162
And most importantly,
put it in the script and practice it.

00:14:12.246 --> 00:14:15.287
Practice it just as much
as the words you say out loud.

00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:19.537
So if you’re running your intro
in the shower three times in a row,

00:14:19.579 --> 00:14:23.954
it would go silent bit, out loud bit,
silent, out loud, silent, out loud,

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:26.787
until it is inextricably linked

00:14:27.287 --> 00:14:30.246
and it is just a part of your process,

00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:33.621
and it is repeatable and reliable.

00:14:34.287 --> 00:14:36.787
And then it’s just there
for you when you need it.

00:14:38.704 --> 00:14:41.704
Now, I want to leave you
with this final thought.

00:14:42.496 --> 00:14:43.787
When you’re at home

00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:46.371
and you’re practicing
some of these techniques,

00:14:46.454 --> 00:14:48.496
like turn up the energy and speak up,

00:14:48.787 --> 00:14:51.329
pause like a boss,

00:14:52.621 --> 00:14:54.496
superhero stance,

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:59.704
practice with purpose,
and your silent sentence,

00:15:00.787 --> 00:15:04.246
please know that it might feel
uncomfortable at first because it’s new

00:15:04.246 --> 00:15:05.704
and that is normal.

00:15:06.162 --> 00:15:09.871
But think back to when I was demonstrating
the nervous captain at the top.

00:15:09.912 --> 00:15:11.662
How did that make you feel?

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:16.121
And then when the confident captain
came out, “Oh, what a relief.

00:15:16.246 --> 00:15:18.954
Now I can just sit back
and enjoy the ride.”

00:15:19.329 --> 00:15:23.079
Remember that feeling of safety
you had as an audience member

00:15:23.162 --> 00:15:25.579
and bring that into
your next rehearsal.

00:15:25.912 --> 00:15:29.037
You can give that gift to your audience.

00:15:29.371 --> 00:15:34.454
Reach outside your comfort zone
to make your audience feel safe

00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:38.579
by making the choices
of a confident captain.

00:15:39.079 --> 00:15:40.454
And who knows?

00:15:41.537 --> 00:15:43.162
You might even have fun.

00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:46.162
Have a great trip.

00:15:47.537 --> 00:15:50.537
(Cheers and applause)
