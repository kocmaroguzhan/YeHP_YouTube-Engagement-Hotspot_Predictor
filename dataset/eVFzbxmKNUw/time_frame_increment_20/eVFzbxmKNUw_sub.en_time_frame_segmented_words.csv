0,20,"Picture this , you ’re going on a boat trip , and you get on board with your family , and you got your bags , and the captain comes out to greet you and says , “"
20,40,"Hi , Um ... My name is Montana ... Von Fliss . Uh , so ... I ’ll be your captain for this journey ... So , uh ... Oh , boy ... Let ’s just have a great trip . Sorry . ” Nope . Get me off of this boat ."
40,60,"What we want in that moment is for the captain to walk out and say , “ Hi , my name is Montana Von Fleiss , I ’ll be your captain for this journey . Let ’s have a great trip . ” The point is , when you are the speaker , you are the captain for that journey , and how you show up really"
60,80,"matters . For the last 17 years , I ’ve coached thousands of speakers all over the world , from big tech companies to small startups , and everyone , from new hires to CEOs of Fortune 500 companies , want to know , how do you show up and look confident ? So I ’d like to share"
80,100,"my top five tips for how to be confident , even if you ’re not . So let 's break it down . What was the difference between those two captains ? What did you see ? What did you hear ? And not just , “ One seemed nervous , one seemed confident . ” But what was I doing differently to make you think that ?"
100,120,"Different volume , different words , certainly different body language . But the truth is , I was n’t feeling particularly confident . I was just making certain physical and vocal choices to make you think that . You can do that too . Anyone can do this ."
120,140,"So , what are those confident - looking choices ? Number one . Turn up the energy and speak up . When you speak up , even just a little bit , it reads as confident , and you do n’t have to shout . Think about it this way . On a scale of 1 to 10 , aim for a 5 . Yes ,"
140,160,"it goes to 11 , but you can just aim for a five . I ’m here at a five right now . I can bring it back down to a three here . Nervous captain was here . And we bring it back up to a five , and it sounds prepared , positive , and confident . So turn up the energy and speak up ."
160,180,"Number two . Pause ... like a boss . Nervous speakers tend to talk really fast , right ? And when they do have a pause , they fill it in with verbal filler , likes and ums . However , if you try to speak more slowly , it just sounds like this , right ?"
180,200,"And that 's not better . So instead , make strategic pauses . Pause in transition . Pause for emphasis . Pause ... like a boss . Number three . Superhero stance . Imagine you are a superhero . You can do"
200,220,"it from your chair . How would a superhero sit ? Yes . Let that change your posture . I see you . Yes . Let that bring a smile to your face and have some better eye contact . All of that reads as confident , and pretending to be a superhero is just a super quick way to have"
220,240,"confident - looking body language . Now , this one also goes to 11 . But you can just aim for a five , and that will be great . Tuck in that cape and go save the day . And you can stand in superhero backstage to boost your"
240,260,"confidence , but I ’m saying bring that superhero stance on stage so that your audience sees you as confident . And if you need an easy shortcut , just make the shape . Just make the shape of a confident person . The audience can not read your mind . They do n’t know how you ’re feeling , so"
260,280,"just make the shape and they will go with it . Like , if you came over to my house for dinner and I opened up the door and I was like , “ Hi , come on in , we ’re having chicken . ” You ’d be like , “ Oh , is this a bad time ? ” You know , you ’ve got to make the shape of a good host . Make the"
280,300,"smile shape , right ? Instead of crossed arm shape , open up . “ Hi , welcome . Come on in . ” If you ’re not sure if you ’re making confident - looking choices , you can just video yourself and watch it back . I feel like I just saw you say , “ Um , not doing that"
300,320,"one . ” I know most people do n’t like to watch themselves , I get it . But would n’t you rather ... make that adjustment before you ’re in front of your audience ? Yes . Videoing yourself is a great way to check in to see that you ’re doing the techniques , but also to see that it ’s"
320,340,"still authentically you , your version of confident captain . Now , how can you do all of these things on performance day ? Number four . Practice with purpose . So , make yourself a rehearsal schedule . Put it in your calendar . You can give"
340,360,"yourself a little treat when you do a run through . And make it practice with purpose by giving yourself a specific goal or layering in one new confident captain technique each day . If it ’s a week before your event , aim to run it all the way through at least once a day . If you have no"
360,380,"time for a run through , just take the opening and closing , and run that three times in a row from anywhere . When you ’re in the shower , when you ’re walking your dog , when you ’re making a meal for your kids . I know my kids are very used to me walking around the house talking to myself . Whatever you need to do to get in those repetitions ."
380,400,And do n’t be afraid of over practice . Do n't let that stop you . You can just let go of your verbatim script if it ’s starting to sound robotic . And you can still use bullet point speaker notes to remind yourself of what you would like to say and to invite you to
400,420,"say it a little bit differently each time to keep it fresh . And let me be clear , by practice , I mean standing up , saying it out loud , imagining your audience and inviting them in , clicking through your slides , doing it as much like it will be on the day ,"
420,440,"whether it ’s virtual or in person . And I know it might feel a little funny saying it out loud to yourself , but think about when you learn a new sport , or when you practice a musical instrument . If you had a piano concert on Friday , and you got new music on"
440,460,"Monday , would you only read your music every day and then play it for the very first time at the concert on Friday ? No way . And yet , I see speakers do this all the time . Give yourself a chance . Practice helps everything . And it can really boost your"
460,480,"confidence to practice with purpose by layering in one new technique each day . Okay , those first four techniques , they ’re all about how to appear confident , regardless of how you ’re feeling . I ’ve got one more technique for you , and it ’s a"
480,500,"big one . But this is the real gem . It 's the one that makes all the others shine . This is number five , the silent sentence . This is about what you choose to tell yourself . I ’ve been a professional actor since I was a kid , and I have"
500,520,"always loved going on stage as an actor , as a speaker , as an emcee . And , at the same time , I have often been not just nervous , sometimes downright terrified to step on a stage . I ’m shaking , I ’m sweating , and I ’m like , “ What was I"
520,540,"thinking ? Why do I do this to myself ? ” And all these unhelpful voices flood in . And I just tried to make it stop , push it away . And of course that never worked . And I kept going on stage because I love it . And years later , when I became a speaker coach , I got asked to do all these"
540,560,"professional presentations , and they went well , but I still had no way to deal with that massive anxiety . And I was like , “ What can I do ? ” And I thought , “ Well , what am I telling myself ? ” “ What if you mess up ? You better be perfect . ”"
560,580,"I realized I was giving myself an impossible instruction to be perfect . And that really was not working . But what would work ? What would be a better message ? And to figure that out , I had to go back to square one . Like , what do I want ? Why did"
580,600,"I say yes to this speaking gig ? What is my deeper purpose here ? And I realized at the heart of it , I just want to help my audience to the best of my ability . And when I said that , I noticed everything change ."
600,620,"And that 's where I found my first silent sentence . I want to help my audience to the best of my ability . When I said it , even silently to myself , it acted like this override switch . Like I might still be shaking and sweating , but now I have this higher goal , this deeper purpose , and everything aligned to"
620,640,"that . And that became my highest priority . I want to help you . And now , that thought replaced those unhelpful thoughts and everything went better in my performance . And I was like , “ Yes , it worked . Yay ! ” And then I was like , “ Wait ,"
640,660,"how do I do this every time ? Especially when the stakes are high . ” And it dawned on me , if I ’m writing and crafting the words I say out loud , why not write and craft the words I say silently to myself ? Put it in the script . It ’s the silent"
660,680,"part of the script . So now , every time I rehearse , every time I walk onto a stage , every time I join a virtual meeting , I say the following , new and evolved silent sentence , “ I invite you to be"
680,700,"here with me while I am here with you so that I can make this easier for you . ” Now , that invitation to myself to be present , that ’s my definition of stage presence , being"
700,720,"present . And that invitation to the audience to be my partner , that reminds me , these are friends , not foes . And I am choosing to be here . And now I ’m not just making the shape of a good host . I really am a good host because I am genuinely welcoming you to my world ."
720,740,"Now , how do you go about finding your silent sentence ? What do you want ? What 's your deeper purpose ? You could be like me , and you might just want to help people . Or it could be something more specific . For example , you might want at least"
740,760,one person in your audience to walk out and take a CPR class . Or maybe you ’re just super excited to have this experience or share with them some cool solution you have for their problem . You get to fill in the blank and decide what you want to accomplish . And
760,780,"this is not about graduating to some higher level of being where you never again feel nervous . Yeah , I know I have n't . I was feeling it pretty big about 15 minutes ago while getting ready to walk on this stage . And I am , and probably always"
780,800,"will be a recovering perfectionist . That is a well - worn pathway in my brain . It is there , it exists , it can not be erased . But now I have this other pathway . And when big moments like this come up , I get to choose ."
800,820,And that 's what I was doing back there in the wings . I was choosing to gently insist on repeating my silent sentence to set myself up for success . What we tell ourselves really matters . We follow our own instructions all
820,840,"day long . Our whole selves are always listening . So when you notice something is n’t going well , or you ’re fearing something might not go well in the future , use this checklist . What am I telling myself ? What 's being broadcast ?"
840,860,"Then replace that with a better sentence to help set you up for where you ’d like to go . And most importantly , put it in the script and practice it . Practice it just as much as the words you say out loud . So if you ’re running your intro in the shower three times in a row , it"
860,880,"would go silent bit , out loud bit , silent , out loud , silent , out loud , until it is inextricably linked and it is just a part of your process , and it is repeatable and reliable . And then it ’s just there for you when you need it . Now , I want to leave"
880,900,"you with this final thought . When you ’re at home and you ’re practicing some of these techniques , like turn up the energy and speak up , pause like a boss , superhero stance , practice with purpose , and your silent sentence ,"
900,920,"please know that it might feel uncomfortable at first because it ’s new and that is normal . But think back to when I was demonstrating the nervous captain at the top . How did that make you feel ? And then when the confident captain came out , “ Oh , what a relief . Now I can just sit back and enjoy the ride . ” Remember"
920,940,that feeling of safety you had as an audience member and bring that into your next rehearsal . You can give that gift to your audience . Reach outside your comfort zone to make your audience feel safe by making the choices of a confident captain . And who
940,960,knows ? You might even have fun . Have a great trip .
