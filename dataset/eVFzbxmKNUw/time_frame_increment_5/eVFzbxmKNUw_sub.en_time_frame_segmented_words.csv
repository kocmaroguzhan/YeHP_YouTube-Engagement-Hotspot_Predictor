5,10,"Picture this , you"
10,15,"’re going on a boat trip , and you get on board with your family , and"
15,20,"you got your bags , and the captain comes out to greet you and says , “"
20,25,"Hi , Um ... My name is Montana ... Von Fliss . Uh , so ... I"
25,30,"’ll be your captain for this journey ... So ,"
30,35,"uh ... Oh , boy ... Let ’s just have a great trip . Sorry . ”"
35,40,Nope . Get me off of this boat .
40,45,"What we want in that moment is for the captain to walk out and say , “ Hi ,"
45,50,"my name is Montana Von Fleiss , I ’ll be your captain for this journey ."
50,55,"Let ’s have a great trip . ” The point is , when you are the speaker , you"
55,60,"are the captain for that journey , and how you show up really"
60,65,"matters . For the last 17 years , I ’ve coached thousands of speakers all"
65,70,"over the world , from big tech companies to small startups , and"
70,75,"everyone , from new hires to CEOs of Fortune 500 companies , want to"
75,80,"know , how do you show up and look confident ? So I ’d like to share"
80,85,"my top five tips for how to be confident , even if you ’re not . So let 's"
85,90,break it down . What was the difference between those two captains ? What did you see ?
90,95,"What did you hear ? And not just , “ One seemed nervous , one seemed confident . ”"
95,100,But what was I doing differently to make you think that ?
100,105,"Different volume , different words , certainly different body language ."
105,110,"But the truth is , I was n’t feeling particularly"
110,115,confident . I was just making certain physical and vocal choices to make you
115,120,think that . You can do that too . Anyone can do this .
120,125,"So , what are those confident - looking choices ? Number one ."
125,130,"Turn up the energy and speak up . When you speak up , even just a"
130,135,"little bit , it reads as confident , and you do n’t have to shout . Think"
135,140,"about it this way . On a scale of 1 to 10 , aim for a 5 . Yes ,"
140,145,"it goes to 11 , but you can just aim"
145,150,for a five . I ’m here at a five right now . I can bring it back down to a three here .
150,155,"Nervous captain was here . And we bring it back up to a five , and it sounds prepared ,"
155,160,"positive , and confident . So turn up the energy and speak up ."
160,165,Number two . Pause ... like a
165,170,"boss . Nervous speakers tend to talk really fast , right ? And when"
170,175,"they do have a pause , they fill it in with verbal filler , likes and ums . However , if you"
175,180,"try to speak more slowly , it just sounds like this , right ?"
180,185,"And that 's not better . So instead , make strategic pauses . Pause"
185,190,in transition . Pause for emphasis . Pause ...
190,195,like a boss . Number three .
195,200,Superhero stance . Imagine you are a superhero . You can do
200,205,it from your chair . How would a superhero sit ? Yes . Let that
205,210,change your posture . I see you . Yes . Let that bring a smile to your face
210,215,and have some better eye contact . All of that reads as
215,220,"confident , and pretending to be a superhero is just a super quick way to have"
220,225,"confident - looking body language . Now , this one also goes to 11 ."
225,230,But you can just aim for a
230,235,"five , and that will be great . Tuck in that cape and go save the"
235,240,day . And you can stand in superhero backstage to boost your
240,245,"confidence , but I ’m saying bring that superhero stance on stage so that"
245,250,your audience sees you as confident . And if you need an easy
250,255,"shortcut , just make the shape . Just make the shape of a confident person ."
255,260,"The audience can not read your mind . They do n’t know how you ’re feeling , so"
260,265,"just make the shape and they will go with it . Like , if you came over to my house for"
265,270,"dinner and I opened up the door and I was like , “ Hi , come on in , we ’re"
270,275,"having chicken . ” You ’d be like , “ Oh , is this a bad time ? ”"
275,280,"You know , you ’ve got to make the shape of a good host . Make the"
280,285,"smile shape , right ? Instead of crossed arm shape , open up . “ Hi ,"
285,290,welcome . Come on in . ” If you ’re not sure if you ’re
290,295,"making confident - looking choices , you can just video yourself and"
295,300,"watch it back . I feel like I just saw you say , “ Um , not doing that"
300,305,"one . ” I know most people do n’t like to watch themselves , I get"
305,310,it . But would n’t you rather ... make that adjustment before you ’re
310,315,in front of your audience ? Yes . Videoing yourself is a
315,320,"great way to check in to see that you ’re doing the techniques , but also to see that it ’s"
320,325,"still authentically you , your version of confident captain ."
325,330,"Now , how can you do all of these things on performance day ?"
330,335,Number four . Practice with purpose .
335,340,"So , make yourself a rehearsal schedule . Put it in your calendar . You can give"
340,345,yourself a little treat when you do a run through . And make it practice with purpose
345,350,by giving yourself a specific goal or layering in one new confident
350,355,"captain technique each day . If it ’s a week before your event , aim to"
355,360,run it all the way through at least once a day . If you have no
360,365,"time for a run through , just take the opening and closing , and run that three times in a row from"
365,370,"anywhere . When you ’re in the shower , when you ’re walking your dog , when you ’re making a meal for"
370,375,your kids . I know my kids are very used to me walking around the house talking to myself .
375,380,Whatever you need to do to get in those repetitions .
380,385,And do n’t be afraid of over practice . Do n't let
385,390,that stop you . You can just let go of your verbatim script if it ’s
390,395,starting to sound robotic . And you can still use bullet point
395,400,speaker notes to remind yourself of what you would like to say and to invite you to
400,405,say it a little bit differently each time to keep it fresh . And
405,410,"let me be clear , by practice , I mean standing up ,"
410,415,"saying it out loud , imagining your audience and inviting them in ,"
415,420,"clicking through your slides , doing it as much like it will be on the day ,"
420,425,whether it ’s virtual or in person . And I know it might feel a little
425,430,"funny saying it out loud to yourself , but think about"
430,435,"when you learn a new sport , or when you practice a musical instrument ."
435,440,"If you had a piano concert on Friday , and you got new music on"
440,445,"Monday , would you only read your music every day and then play it for the very"
445,450,"first time at the concert on Friday ? No way . And yet , I see"
450,455,speakers do this all the time . Give yourself a chance .
455,460,Practice helps everything . And it can really boost your
460,465,confidence to practice with purpose by layering in one
465,470,"new technique each day . Okay , those first four"
470,475,"techniques , they ’re all about how to appear confident , regardless of how you"
475,480,"’re feeling . I ’ve got one more technique for you , and it ’s a"
480,485,big one . But this is the real gem . It 's the one that makes all the others
485,490,"shine . This is number five , the silent"
490,495,sentence . This is about what you choose to tell
495,500,"yourself . I ’ve been a professional actor since I was a kid , and I have"
500,505,"always loved going on stage as an actor , as a speaker , as an"
505,510,"emcee . And , at the same time , I have often been not just"
510,515,"nervous , sometimes downright terrified to step"
515,520,"on a stage . I ’m shaking , I ’m sweating , and I ’m like , “ What was I"
520,525,thinking ? Why do I do this to myself ? ” And all these unhelpful voices flood in . And
525,530,"I just tried to make it stop , push it away . And of course that never worked ."
530,535,And I kept going on stage because I love it .
535,540,"And years later , when I became a speaker coach , I got asked to do all these"
540,545,"professional presentations , and they went well , but I still had"
545,550,no way to deal with that massive anxiety . And I was
550,555,"like , “ What can I do ? ” And I thought , “ Well , what am I telling"
555,560,myself ? ” “ What if you mess up ? You better be perfect . ”
560,565,I realized I was giving myself an impossible
565,570,instruction to be perfect . And that really was not working .
570,575,But what would work ? What would be a better message ? And to figure that
575,580,"out , I had to go back to square one . Like , what do I want ? Why did"
580,585,I say yes to this speaking gig ? What is my deeper purpose here ?
585,590,"And I realized at the heart of it , I just"
590,595,want to help my audience to the best of my ability .
595,600,"And when I said that , I noticed everything change ."
600,605,And that 's where I found my first silent sentence . I want to help my
605,610,"audience to the best of my ability . When I said it , even silently to"
610,615,"myself , it acted like this override switch . Like I might still be shaking and sweating ,"
615,620,"but now I have this higher goal , this deeper purpose , and everything aligned to"
620,625,that . And that became my highest priority . I want to help you . And
625,630,"now , that thought replaced those unhelpful thoughts and everything went better in my"
630,635,"performance . And I was like , “ Yes ,"
635,640,"it worked . Yay ! ” And then I was like , “ Wait ,"
640,645,how do I do this every time ? Especially when the stakes are high . ”
645,650,"And it dawned on me , if I ’m writing and crafting the"
650,655,"words I say out loud , why not write and craft the words I say"
655,660,silently to myself ? Put it in the script . It ’s the silent
660,665,"part of the script . So now , every time I"
665,670,"rehearse , every time I walk onto a stage , every time I"
670,675,"join a virtual meeting , I say the following , new and evolved"
675,680,"silent sentence , “ I invite you to be"
680,685,here with me while I am here with you
685,690,so that I can make this easier for you . ”
690,695,"Now , that invitation to myself to be"
695,700,"present , that ’s my definition of stage presence , being"
700,705,"present . And that invitation to the audience to be my partner ,"
705,710,"that reminds me , these are friends , not foes . And I am choosing to"
710,715,be here . And now I ’m not just making the shape of a good host . I really am a good
715,720,host because I am genuinely welcoming you to my world .
720,725,"Now , how do you go about finding your silent sentence ?"
725,730,What do you want ? What 's your
730,735,"deeper purpose ? You could be like me , and you might just want to help"
735,740,"people . Or it could be something more specific . For example , you might want at least"
740,745,one person in your audience to walk out and take a CPR class .
745,750,Or maybe you ’re just super excited to have this experience or share with
750,755,them some cool solution you have for their problem . You get to fill in
755,760,the blank and decide what you want to accomplish . And
760,765,this is not about graduating to some higher level of being where you
765,770,"never again feel nervous . Yeah , I know I have n't . I was"
770,775,feeling it pretty big about 15 minutes ago while getting
775,780,"ready to walk on this stage . And I am , and probably always"
780,785,will be a recovering perfectionist .
785,790,"That is a well - worn pathway in my brain . It is there , it"
790,795,"exists , it can not be erased . But now I have this other"
795,800,"pathway . And when big moments like this come up , I get to choose ."
800,805,And that 's what I was doing back there in the wings . I was
805,810,choosing to gently insist on repeating my silent sentence
810,815,to set myself up for success . What we
815,820,tell ourselves really matters . We follow our own instructions all
820,825,day long . Our whole selves are always listening . So
825,830,"when you notice something is n’t going well , or you ’re fearing something might not go well in the"
830,835,"future , use this checklist . What am I"
835,840,telling myself ? What 's being broadcast ?
840,845,Then replace that with a better sentence to help set
845,850,"you up for where you ’d like to go . And most importantly , put"
850,855,it in the script and practice it . Practice it just as much as the words you say
855,860,"out loud . So if you ’re running your intro in the shower three times in a row , it"
860,865,"would go silent bit , out loud bit , silent , out loud , silent , out loud , until it is"
865,870,inextricably linked and it is just a part of your
870,875,"process , and it is repeatable and reliable . And then it ’s"
875,880,"just there for you when you need it . Now , I want to leave"
880,885,you with this final thought . When you ’re at home and you ’re
885,890,"practicing some of these techniques , like turn up the energy and speak up , pause"
890,895,"like a boss , superhero stance ,"
895,900,"practice with purpose , and your silent sentence ,"
900,905,please know that it might feel uncomfortable at first because it ’s new and that
905,910,is normal . But think back to when I was demonstrating the nervous captain at the top .
910,915,How did that make you feel ? And then when the confident captain
915,920,"came out , “ Oh , what a relief . Now I can just sit back and enjoy the ride . ” Remember"
920,925,that feeling of safety you had as an audience member and bring that into your next
925,930,rehearsal . You can give that gift to your audience . Reach
930,935,outside your comfort zone to make your audience feel safe by
935,940,making the choices of a confident captain . And who
940,945,knows ? You might even have fun .
945,950,Have a great trip .
