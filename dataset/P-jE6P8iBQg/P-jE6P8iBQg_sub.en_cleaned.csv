1082.36,1084.51,secret room oh let's keep going so this
1084.52,1086.23,is like the James Charles closet all the
1086.24,1088.39,most iconic outfits that I have worn on
1088.4,1090.87,social media whether it was to Coachella
1090.88,1093.07,or to different commercials for my brand
1093.08,1094.71,or for things throughout the years
1094.72,1097.07,everything is in here Lexi Rivera has
1097.08,1098.87,already been in here and done a house
1098.88,1101.47,tour with James so if you want to see
1101.48,1103.549,more of the house go to that video after
1103.559,1105.549,I feel so bad for Hannah does she live
1105.559,1107.19,with you yeah she lives with me
1107.2,1108.59,sometimes it would be terrible living
1108.6,1110.39,here let's go in here this looks
1110.4,1112.51,suspicious hold up oh look Sandy I think
1112.52,1117.59,I found it hey Sandy I found it no
1117.6,1119.39,that's two down you weren't supposed to
1119.4,1121.11,find that one in order to officially
1121.12,1122.789,find this secret room we do have to jump
1122.799,1124.029,into it you know how like when you buy
1124.039,1125.63,like a like a rollax or like a vintage
1125.64,1127.39,watch they hold their value so like
1127.4,1129.39,birken bags from heres is the same thing
1129.4,1130.99,in addition to the new dog I think Sal
1131.0,1133.51,is just into purses so if you which one
1133.52,1134.99,could we give her maybe you'll have to
1135.0,1136.87,like bring her back next time and she
1136.88,1139.31,can make the decision herself that's a
1139.32,1141.35,good idea if I brought her back could
1141.36,1142.549,you guys do some makeup together or
1142.559,1144.149,something yeah of course well comment
1144.159,1145.549,below if you want to see that yeah and
1145.559,1147.62,then s gets a purse out of the deal
1148.88,1151.789,well we'll say about that one here we go
1151.799,1157.27,woo hurry up all right I'm in three 2 1
1159.2,1162.27,yo oh my gosh this is awesome I
1162.28,1164.19,decorated this one to have bunch of TVs
1164.2,1166.71,video games beds lights I think this is
1166.72,1168.549,awesome but does Hannah like it every
1168.559,1169.71,time time we build a room like this she
1169.72,1171.549,tells us not to do it so to be honest no
1171.559,1173.35,she hates it but I like it so I'm going
1173.36,1174.63,to keep doing it what if I told you
1174.64,1176.39,there was another secret room entrance
1176.4,1177.95,inside this secret room why don't you

1180.159,1181.59,real quick downstairs is really cool
1181.6,1183.23,because a lot of houses in California
1183.24,1186.18,don't have basements but I

1243.0,1244.23,it all in skincare when you're
1244.24,1245.75,developing it it's really important to
1245.76,1247.149,use the right ingredients the right
1247.159,1249.149,products especially like nowadays all
1249.159,1250.43,these little girad are running around
1250.44,1252.39,Sephora and buying like skin care that's
1252.4,1254.59,intended for wrinkle reducing and lines
1254.6,1256.35,and all these things maybe one day in
1256.36,1257.909,the future but for right now I'm not a
1257.919,1259.99,skincare expert I focus on makeup and
1260.0,1261.71,skincare should be made for younger skin
1261.72,1263.19,too and there's not a lot of skincare
1263.2,1266.43,out there for younger skin MH yet next
1266.44,1268.39,salor are going to design a YouTuber's
