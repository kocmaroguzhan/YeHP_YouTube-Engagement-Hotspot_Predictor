144.7,145.841,"Okay, do you like-- I like him."
145.841,147.69,"You like him. Are you pretty strict with him,"
147.69,149.36,on like what he can and can't do?
149.36,151.412,"A little bit. He's a rule follower, so it's helpful."
151.412,152.68,Because you enforce rules.
152.68,154.11,We manage expectations.
154.11,156.28,That's a dean.
156.28,158.3,That's a dean for sure.
158.3,159.93,You seem like you're hiding something.
159.93,161.47,"You're putting up a wall right now, you know?"
161.47,163.576,I know where the bodies are buried.

180.93,183.119,I'm gonna say teacher.
183.119,183.952,Why do you think I'm a teacher?
183.952,186.51,"Okay, because I feel like I'm being tricked in this video."
186.51,188.57,How many teachers do you know that have tattoos?
188.57,190.35,That's exactly why I'm guessing.
190.35,191.183,I'm gonna say teacher.
191.183,193.29,Do you work a 9-5? Most days.
193.29,194.49,How much vacation do you get?

210.46,211.93,"That could be hair salon receptionist though,"
211.93,213.893,because I've cried at the hair salon before too.
213.893,214.726,Gimme a hug.
214.726,216.6,"Like, a comforting."
216.6,217.873,"Ooh, that was solid!"
217.873,219.72,That was a solid hug!
219.72,222.59,I think that I'm looking at hair salon receptionist.
222.59,224.31,"Pretty girl, has a nice smile."
224.31,226.21,People like wanna look at you.
226.21,227.61,"On the phone? Yeah, but like,"

238.91,240.19,"No way, part time?"
240.19,241.023,"Occasionally, yeah."
241.023,242.276,"Occasional, really?"
242.276,243.806,"That's not on the list, but I should get that point."
243.806,244.67,Yes.
244.67,246.45,I'm gonna go with scientist right off the bat.
246.45,247.88,I see you all the time and I know
247.88,251.15,there's a lot of labs around my restaurant.
251.15,252.59,"Thank you, do the honors for me."

262.33,263.823,Discipline me.
263.823,265.62,"Dae, I need the iPad right now."
265.62,266.453,Fuck you.
267.31,270.27,Well.
270.27,272.58,"You can just give me the iPad right now,"
272.58,273.95,and then you can have it again later
273.95,276.11,"next time you want it, or if I have to take it away,"
276.11,278.76,then you're not gonna get to use it for like a week.
278.76,279.593,Ooh.
280.48,281.92,Here. Thanks.
281.92,283.783,You're a dean of students. Why do you think that?
283.783,286.702,"That was very, uh, dean like."
286.702,288.84,Bam.
288.84,291.05,You must be the scientist.
291.05,292.4,Why?
292.4,293.737,I don't have any more options.
294.57,296.22,"You like, broke your foot or something."
296.22,297.8,I dropped a piano on it.
297.8,299.09,You dropped a piano?
299.09,301.17,"Well, my brother dropped a piano on it."
301.17,302.57,He sucks.
302.57,304.93,Do you know what a simulated patient is?
304.93,308.01,"It's, like, a patient who's not real."
308.01,309.96,"Oh my god, you're faking a broken foot"
309.96,311.753,to go get drugs. For the Vicodin.
311.753,313.77,Bitch!
313.77,315.838,I just crushed it.
315.838,317.655,Did I get it at the end?
317.655,319.923,You guys!
319.923,321.22,How many do you think you got right?
321.22,322.359,Four. I think I got them
322.359,323.192,all right.
323.192,326.01,Why would I guess something I think is not right?
326.01,327.5,"With a show of hands,"
327.5,328.63,who did Dae get correct?
328.63,331.19,Boom!
331.19,333.593,Whoa!
333.593,335.074,I never got zero before.
337.344,338.727,Oh no!
338.727,339.644,"Yes, yes!"
340.651,342.362,"Oh wait, that means I got someone else right, no?"
342.362,344.016,No.
344.016,345.058,Damn!
345.058,348.31,Yes!
348.31,349.143,Cool.
349.143,351.491,"Change to the right placards, please."
354.89,356.64,Oh my god.
356.64,359.887,Oh my god!
359.887,360.72,What?!
360.72,362.42,What grade do you teach?
362.42,363.41,"Um, high schoolers."
363.41,364.243,Cute.
364.243,365.87,"Oh dang, you have all the 14 year old girls"
365.87,367.3,after that nose ring.
367.3,369.43,Not my target demographic.
369.43,370.669,That's good.
373.66,375.278,I still don't fully know what that means.
376.111,378.82,"So I pretend to be sick for medical students,"
378.82,380.7,so that they can practice their bedside manner.
380.7,382.646,Oh!
382.646,384.81,Do you get to like pick a random illness?
384.81,386.71,"No, I'm trained on specific ones."
386.71,387.98,Like what?
387.98,389.98,"Late term labor, UTIs."
389.98,391.29,Are you an actor then?
391.29,393.07,"For like, do like-- Yeah."
393.07,393.993,"Ready, okay."
394.924,397.283,"Um, so I have to pee like every 20 minutes."
397.283,398.39,It's like really annoying. You've got a UTI?
398.39,400.377,"Yeah, ding, ding, ding."
401.21,402.303,You should be a doctor!
402.303,404.08,Can you explain to me what a longshoreman is?
404.08,406.559,Or is it longshoreman?
406.559,407.785,It's longs.
407.785,409.66,Now you got me saying it. See?
409.66,410.52,Longshoreman.
410.52,413.772,"Container ships come in, take them off, put them back on."
413.772,414.675,Let them go. Nice.
414.675,415.68,What do people ship the most?
415.68,418.06,"It could be random goods, for like Target"
418.06,419.62,"or, uh, cars."
419.62,421.32,"How much do you make, can I ask?"
422.57,424.27,"Ooh, he makes money."
424.27,425.92,"Like, could you be a sugar daddy?"
426.761,428.56,I could.
428.56,430.29,We like that.
430.29,431.123,That's fun.
431.123,433.555,"Yo, you're so funeral director-y."
435.264,436.92,What I gave you originally was the dean.
436.92,438.98,"I feel like those are two kind of like similar things,"
438.98,440.8,"like if you can console crying people,"
440.8,443.08,you can console children as well.
443.08,443.913,Yeah.
443.913,446.62,What was the biggest surprise that you had from your job?
446.62,450.4,Sometimes it's surprising how much relief I see in people.
450.4,452.24,They've been with their loved one
452.24,454.55,"through a long illness, they're relieved it's over."
454.55,456.06,Are you a hair salon receptionist?
456.06,456.893,Do they do your hair?
456.893,457.726,Do they wash your hair?
457.726,458.93,Do you get free washes? All the time.
458.93,461.577,But were you surprised? Hell no!
461.577,463.2,"I mean, look at your hair, it's beautiful."
463.2,466.35,"Yeah, I definitely like gender stereotyped this one."
466.35,468.7,"I apologize for that. Don't apologize, it's cool."
468.7,470.577,You have pretty hair. I like the job
470.577,472.48,because it allows me to take off a lot of time
472.48,473.75,and travel whenever I want.
473.75,475.53,So you're really cute for not a cute job.
475.53,478.68,Do you like have the heebie jeebies over stuff like this?
478.68,479.513,Not really.
479.513,482.7,"Most of our kills are fresh kills, so it's not that gross."
482.7,484.52,You just dog poop bag style.
484.52,485.703,"Yeah, no, that's gross."
485.703,487.42,When it's really gross is when they've
487.42,491.47,"been sitting for a bit, and they're maggot-y and smelly."
491.47,492.997,"But you get the grabber pull. No no, you don't."
492.997,494.855,So you can grabber pull it. No.
494.855,496.163,Into--
496.163,497.323,"That was surprising. Ew, ick."
497.323,500.019,Nice to meet you.
500.019,501.84,Are you surprised? That you're a scientist?
501.84,503.8,"Yes. Honestly, I thought"
503.8,504.633,you could be anything.
504.633,506.86,"You could be a scientist, Jesus."
506.86,509.34,I'm not surprised. What kind of scientist?
509.34,512.62,"I try to cure people who have genetic problems,"
512.62,516.15,so I use viruses to deliver genes to cure them.
516.15,517.05,Wow.
517.05,518.565,"Hey. Hot teacher, what's up?"
519.73,520.95,English. No.
520.95,522.19,Math. No.
522.19,523.24,Art. No.
523.24,524.242,Music. No.
524.242,525.41,Gym. No.
525.41,527.71,What else is left?
527.71,528.82,Science!
528.82,530.13,Are your students gonna watch this?
530.13,532.355,"Yo, they're gonna be so stoked about this!"
532.355,533.97,Yeah.
533.97,534.88,How old do you teach?
534.88,536.21,Freshmen and sophomores mostly.
536.21,537.33,Do you like them?
537.33,539.28,"Yeah, they're cool. You like do not like them."
539.28,540.63,"No, it's endless entertainment."
540.63,542.34,I actually really do like working with them.
542.34,543.58,Do your students like you?
543.58,545.64,"Some of them do, and some of them probably think,"
545.64,547.0,"well, actually, I know for a fact"
547.0,548.87,some of them think I talk too much.
548.87,550.901,You're literally a teacher.
550.901,552.581,Isn't that like the job?
552.581,553.414,Stupid.
553.414,555.39,I don't remember what job I guessed you with.
555.39,556.265,"Scientist? Scientist,"
556.265,557.359,because it was the only one left.
557.359,558.192,Oh.
558.192,560.423,"I mean, it's like in the-- Not at all."
561.938,563.77,Do you still love me? No.
563.77,565.02,"Alright, dean of students."
565.02,567.173,"That to me, screams like,"
568.059,568.933,bitch.
570.54,571.78,I don't think any of my students
571.78,572.89,would describe me as a bitch.
572.89,574.49,So are you like his boss?
574.49,577.74,I would work with him if he could get kids' iPads.
577.74,580.8,What's the most discipline you had to give a kid?
580.8,582.48,I've expelled students before.
582.48,585.76,"We had a kid this year steal a car from a neighborhood,"
585.76,588.654,and then like drive it around the parking lot.
588.654,589.7,What happened with the kid who stole the car?
589.7,591.96,"I mean, he went to juvie."
591.96,593.44,I'm learning so much.
