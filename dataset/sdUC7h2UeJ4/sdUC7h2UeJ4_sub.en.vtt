Oh, simulated patient.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.690
That's very different.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.978

What'd you just do?

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:18.100

- Sounds like a teacher.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.060

(laughter)
Why would you say that?

00:01:49.503 --> 00:01:50.636
- Well, you look like the teacher

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:52.120
that would like confiscate
your students' weed

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.941
but like smoke it after school.

00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:54.774
(laughter)

00:01:54.774 --> 00:01:57.603

- I'm gonna go exterminator.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.210
You seem like you could kill a good bug

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.170
forcefully without any fear.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.003
- Thank you.

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:12.836

(laughter) Feel like I didn't
do my homework or something.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.350

- You like him. Are you
pretty strict with him,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.360
on like what he can and can't do?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.412
- A little bit. He's a rule
follower, so it's helpful.

00:02:31.412 --> 00:02:32.680
- Because you enforce rules.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.110
- We manage expectations.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.280
- That's a dean.
(laughter)

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.300
That's a dean for sure.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.930
- You seem like you're hiding something.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.470
You're putting up a wall
right now, you know?

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.576
- I know where the bodies are buried.

00:02:43.576 --> 00:02:45.400
(nervous laughter)

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.574
- Well, funeral director it is.

00:02:47.574 --> 00:02:48.407
(laughter)

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.000
- I'm good.
- Nice handshake.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.600
What were you like growing up?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.550
- Troublemaker.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.750
- Not the like school type?

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.820
- I was smart.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.056
I just didn't--
- Didn't apply yourself, okay.

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:00.930
(laughter)

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.119
- I'm gonna say teacher.

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.952
- Why do you think I'm a teacher?

00:03:03.952 --> 00:03:06.510
- Okay, because I feel like I'm
being tricked in this video.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.570
- How many teachers do you
know that have tattoos?

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.350
- That's exactly why I'm guessing.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.183
I'm gonna say teacher.

00:03:11.183 --> 00:03:13.290
- Do you work a 9-5?
- Most days.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.490
- How much vacation do you get?

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.323
- A lot.

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:16.650
Vacation is why I have the job.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.980
- Okay, we're going teacher,
we're going teacher.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.750
- Thank you.
- Thanks, teach.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.020
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.610
I'm seeing cute shoes, great hair.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.443
- Thank you.

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:26.840
- Do you interact with people a lot?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.673
- Every day.

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:29.150
- Do you have crying people at work?

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.460
- Sometimes people cry.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.930
- That could be hair
salon receptionist though,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.893
because I've cried at the
hair salon before too.

00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:34.726
(laughter)
Gimme a hug.

00:03:34.726 --> 00:03:36.600
Like, a comforting.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.873
Ooh, that was solid!
(laughter)

00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:39.720
That was a solid hug!

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.590
- I think that I'm looking
at hair salon receptionist.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.310
Pretty girl, has a nice smile.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.210
People like wanna look at you.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.610
- On the phone?
- Yeah, but like,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.920
you're the first person
someone sees when they walk in.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.753
- Yeah.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.860
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.693
- You have good hair too!

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.431
You could be like a musical
roadie or something.

00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:58.910
- I am a roadie!

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.190
- No way, part time?

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.023
- Occasionally, yeah.

00:04:01.023 --> 00:04:02.276
- Occasional, really?

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.806
That's not on the list, but
I should get that point.

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:04.670
(laughter)
- Yes.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.450
- I'm gonna go with
scientist right off the bat.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.880
I see you all the time and I know

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.150
there's a lot of labs
around my restaurant.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.590
- Thank you, do the honors for me.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.490
- Perfect.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.840
- Thank you, my friend.
- You're welcome.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.357

You like kids?
- Yeah.

00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:20.227
- Pretend I'm a kid.

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:21.060
Pretend I'm your kid.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.330
I don't wanna get off my iPad.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.823
Discipline me.

00:04:23.823 --> 00:04:25.620
- Dae, I need the iPad right now.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.453
- Fuck you.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.270
- Well.
(laughter)

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.580
You can just give me the iPad right now,

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.950
and then you can have it again later

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.110
next time you want it, or
if I have to take it away,

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.760
then you're not gonna get
to use it for like a week.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.593
- Ooh.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.920
Here.
- Thanks.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.783
- You're a dean of students.
- [Joe] Why do you think that?

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.702
- That was very, uh, dean like.

00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:48.840
Bam.
(laughter)

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.050
- You must be the scientist.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.400
- Why?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.737
- I don't have any more options.

00:04:53.737 --> 00:04:54.570
(laughter)

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.220
- You like, broke your foot or something.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.800
- I dropped a piano on it.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.090
- You dropped a piano?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.170
- Well, my brother dropped a piano on it.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.570
- He sucks.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.930
Do you know what a simulated patient is?

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.010
- It's, like, a patient who's not real.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.960
- Oh my god, you're faking a broken foot

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.753
to go get drugs.
- For the Vicodin.

00:05:11.753 --> 00:05:13.770
(gasping)
- Bitch!

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.838
I just crushed it.
(laughter)

00:05:15.838 --> 00:05:17.655
Did I get it at the end?

00:05:17.655 --> 00:05:19.923
(laughter)
You guys!

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:21.220
- [Crewman] How many do
you think you got right?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.359
- Four.
- I think I got them

00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:23.192
all right.

00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:26.010
Why would I guess something
I think is not right?

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.500
- [Crewman] With a show of hands,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.630
who did Dae get correct?

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.190
- Boom!
(scattered giggling)

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.593
Whoa!
(laughter)

00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:35.074
I never got zero before.

00:05:35.074 --> 00:05:37.344
(laughter)

00:05:37.344 --> 00:05:38.727
- Oh no!

00:05:38.727 --> 00:05:39.644
- Yes, yes!

00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:42.362
Oh wait, that means I got
someone else right, no?

00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:44.016
(laughter)
- No.

00:05:44.016 --> 00:05:45.058
- Damn!

00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:48.310
- Yes!
(giggling)

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.143
Cool.

00:05:49.143 --> 00:05:51.491
- [Crewman] Change to the
right placards, please.

00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:54.890
(indistinct murmuring)

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.640
- Oh my god.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.887
Oh my god!
(laughter)

00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:00.720
What?!

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.420
- What grade do you teach?

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.410
- Um, high schoolers.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.243
- Cute.

00:06:04.243 --> 00:06:05.870
Oh dang, you have all
the 14 year old girls

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.300
after that nose ring.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.430
- Not my target demographic.
(laughter)

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.669
- That's good.

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.660
(playful music)

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.278
- I still don't fully
know what that means.

00:06:15.278 --> 00:06:16.111
(laughter)

00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:18.820
- So I pretend to be sick
for medical students,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.700
so that they can practice
their bedside manner.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.646
- Oh!
(giggling)

00:06:22.646 --> 00:06:24.810
- Do you get to like
pick a random illness?

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.710
- No, I'm trained on specific ones.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.980
- Like what?

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.980
- Late term labor, UTIs.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.290
- Are you an actor then?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.070
For like, do like--
- Yeah.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.993
Ready, okay.

00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:37.283
Um, so I have to pee
like every 20 minutes.

00:06:37.283 --> 00:06:38.390
It's like really annoying.
- You've got a UTI?

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.377
- Yeah, ding, ding, ding.

00:06:40.377 --> 00:06:41.210
(laughter)
(clapping)

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.303
You should be a doctor!

00:06:42.303 --> 00:06:44.080
- Can you explain to me
what a longshoreman is?

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.559
Or is it longshoreman?

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:47.785
- It's longs.

00:06:47.785 --> 00:06:49.660
Now you got me saying it.
- See?

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.520
- Longshoreman.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.772
Container ships come in, take
them off, put them back on.

00:06:53.772 --> 00:06:54.675
Let them go.
- [Dae] Nice.

00:06:54.675 --> 00:06:55.680
What do people ship the most?

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.060
- It could be random
goods, for like Target

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.620
or, uh, cars.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.320
- How much do you make, can I ask?

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.270
Ooh, he makes money.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.920
Like, could you be a sugar daddy?

00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:08.560
- I could.
(laughter)

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.290
- We like that.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.123
That's fun.

00:07:11.123 --> 00:07:13.555
- Yo, you're so funeral director-y.

00:07:13.555 --> 00:07:15.264
(laughter)

00:07:15.264 --> 00:07:16.920
What I gave you originally was the dean.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.980
I feel like those are two
kind of like similar things,

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.800
like if you can console crying people,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.080
you can console children as well.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.913
- Yeah.

00:07:23.913 --> 00:07:26.620
- What was the biggest surprise
that you had from your job?

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.400
- Sometimes it's surprising how
much relief I see in people.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.240
They've been with their loved one

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.550
through a long illness,
they're relieved it's over.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.060
- Are you a hair salon receptionist?

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.893
Do they do your hair?

00:07:36.893 --> 00:07:37.726
Do they wash your hair?

00:07:37.726 --> 00:07:38.930
Do you get free washes?
- All the time.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.577
But were you surprised?
- Hell no!

00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:43.200
I mean, look at your hair, it's beautiful.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.350
- Yeah, I definitely like
gender stereotyped this one.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.700
I apologize for that.
- Don't apologize, it's cool.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.577
- You have pretty hair.
- I like the job

00:07:50.577 --> 00:07:52.480
because it allows me to
take off a lot of time

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.750
and travel whenever I want.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.530
- So you're really cute
for not a cute job.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.680
Do you like have the heebie
jeebies over stuff like this?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.513
- Not really.

00:07:59.513 --> 00:08:02.700
Most of our kills are fresh
kills, so it's not that gross.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.520
You just dog poop bag style.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.703
- Yeah, no, that's gross.
(laughter)

00:08:05.703 --> 00:08:07.420
- When it's really gross is when they've

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.470
been sitting for a bit, and
they're maggot-y and smelly.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.997
But you get the grabber pull.
- No no, you don't.

00:08:12.997 --> 00:08:14.855
- So you can grabber pull it.
- No.

00:08:14.855 --> 00:08:16.163
(laughter)
- Into--

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:17.323
That was surprising.
- Ew, ick.

00:08:17.323 --> 00:08:20.019
Nice to meet you.
(laughter)

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:21.840
- Are you surprised?
- That you're a scientist?

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.800
- Yes.
- Honestly, I thought

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.633
you could be anything.

00:08:24.633 --> 00:08:26.860
You could be a scientist, Jesus.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.340
I'm not surprised.
- What kind of scientist?

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.620
- I try to cure people
who have genetic problems,

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.150
so I use viruses to
deliver genes to cure them.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.050
- Wow.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.565
- Hey.
- Hot teacher, what's up?

00:08:38.565 --> 00:08:39.730
(laughter)

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.950
English.
- No.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.190
- [Lauren] Math.
- No.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.240
- [Lauren] Art.
- No.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.242
- [Lauren] Music.
- No.

00:08:44.242 --> 00:08:45.410
- Gym.
- No.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.710
- What else is left?
(laughter)

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.820
Science!

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.130
Are your students gonna watch this?

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.355
Yo, they're gonna be so stoked about this!

00:08:52.355 --> 00:08:53.970
- Yeah.
(laughter)

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:54.880
- How old do you teach?

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.210
- Freshmen and sophomores mostly.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.330
- Do you like them?

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.280
- Yeah, they're cool.
- You like do not like them.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.630
- No, it's endless entertainment.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.340
I actually really do
like working with them.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.580
- Do your students like you?

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.640
- Some of them do, and some
of them probably think,

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.000
well, actually, I know for a fact

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.870
some of them think I talk too much.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.901
- You're literally a teacher.

00:09:10.901 --> 00:09:12.581
Isn't that like the job?
(laughter)

00:09:12.581 --> 00:09:13.414
Stupid.

00:09:13.414 --> 00:09:15.390
- I don't remember what
job I guessed you with.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.265
Scientist?
- Scientist,

00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:17.359
because it was the only one left.

00:09:17.359 --> 00:09:18.192
- Oh.
(laughter)

00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:20.423
I mean, it's like in the--
- Not at all.

00:09:20.423 --> 00:09:21.938
(laughter)

00:09:21.938 --> 00:09:23.770
- Do you still love me?
- No. (laughter)

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.020
- Alright, dean of students.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.173
That to me, screams like,

00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:28.933
(whispers)
bitch.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.780
- I don't think any of my students

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.890
would describe me as a bitch.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.490
- So are you like his boss?

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.740
- I would work with him if
he could get kids' iPads.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.800
- What's the most discipline
you had to give a kid?

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.480
- I've expelled students before.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.760
We had a kid this year steal
a car from a neighborhood,

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.654
and then like drive it
around the parking lot.

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:49.700
- What happened with the
kid who stole the car?

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.960
- I mean, he went to juvie.
(laughter)

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.440
- I'm learning so much.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.700
- So I did really bad.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.090
I thought that was so easy,
I thought I crushed it.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.290
- Raise your hand if I insulted you?

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.260
Mister D is like slowly--
(laughter)

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.010
- [Crewman] Who would you
most like to apprentice under?

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.160
- I would love to sit in your class

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.294
and see all the girls be like

00:10:06.294 --> 00:10:09.363
(squealing indistinctly)
(laughter)

00:10:09.363 --> 00:10:10.196
- [Crewman] What's the job

00:10:10.196 --> 00:10:11.946
you'd most like to apprentice under?

00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:12.973
- Maybe like a dean of students.

00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:16.370
I do not think I would be good.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.360
- No, I don't.
(laughter)

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.449
I don't think you'd enforce rules!

00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:21.282
- Uh-huh!

00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:23.450
- I feel like you'd probably get along

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.650
with the students really well,

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:25.483
and then be kind of lax with them.

00:10:25.483 --> 00:10:27.894
- Yeah, really, fuck it up!
- You'd be like--

00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:31.927
(applause)
(overlapping mumbling)
