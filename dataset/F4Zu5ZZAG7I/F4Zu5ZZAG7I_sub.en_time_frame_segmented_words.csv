5,10,"Hello , everybody ."
10,15,I 'm going to start with a question .
15,20,How many of you know the person sitting next to you from before today ?
20,25,"Interesting . So , do you remember the first"
25,30,conversation that you ever had with that person ? You know
30,35,conversations are links . Let 's imagine every conversation to be a tiny
35,40,"metal link . And every time you talk to a stranger , a metal link is formed ."
40,45,"And every conversation that you have after that moment , the link gets"
45,50,stronger and stronger . And every day each one of us
50,55,"meets so many strangers : the grocery guy , the cab guy maybe"
55,60,the receptionist at a new office you went to . And with every
60,65,"conversation we build new links . Until finally at the end ,"
65,70,we 've created a kind of massive World Wide
70,75,Web of conversation . World Wide Web . It 's a
75,80,"catchy word . I think I 've heard that somewhere . That 's it ,"
80,85,right ? A conversation . It 's a fascinating thing . A conversation is an
85,90,adventure . A conversation gives you a whole new perspective . A
90,95,conversation opens a door . Conversations can make war and
95,100,conversations can make peace . And conversations define who
100,105,we are as a human race . Think about this . Every
105,110,single person in your life was once a stranger to you . And you
110,115,knew nothing about them until you had that first conversation .
115,120,So I 'm here today to tell you to talk to
120,125,"strangers , to have a conversation . And I 'm here to"
125,130,tell you how . Seven ways that you can make a conversation with almost
130,135,anyone . I 'm a radio
135,140,presenter and I love talking to people . I do . I love
140,145,it . And I 'm so glad that I do it for a living . Here 's what my day is like .
145,150,"Every single morning , I go into an empty room , I put on a mic , and I"
150,155,have a conversation with 1.6 million people ...
155,160,that I ca n't see . Yeah . You
160,165,"know what the hardest part is , though ? It 's time . In a four - hour"
165,170,"show , I get 20 minutes . That 's all the talk"
170,175,there is . And in 20 minutes I have to convince you that I am your best friend .
175,180,How do I do that ? How do I establish a
180,185,"connection ? I have 20 minutes to inform you , to excite you , to"
185,190,"engage with you but most importantly , 20 out of the 20 times that I"
190,195,"switch on that mic , I have to leave a smile on your face ."
195,200,"Except , I ca n't see you , I know nothing about you , and I have no"
200,205,way of gauging your reactions . How do you do it ? How do you talk to a
205,210,"stranger ? Well , my nine years in radio have taught me these"
210,215,simple little tricks .
215,220,"Strangers , they are everywhere . And we 've"
220,225,"always been told , "" Do n't talk to strangers ! "" But I beg to"
225,230,"differ . Every stranger comes with an opportunity , an"
230,235,"opportunity to learn something new , an opportunity to have an experience you 've never had or"
235,240,hear a story that you 've never heard before . And you 've
240,245,"had that moment , right ? You 're in the room with someone you do n't know , and you"
245,250,"look across the room , you see a stranger , and you think , "" I want to talk to this"
250,255,"person . "" And you can almost hear the first word but it just wo n't come out , it kind of"
255,260,"gets stuck about here , it kind of goes up and down and you do"
260,265,n't know - You know what ? Here 's my advice : just say it .
265,270,"What 's the worst that can happen ? They want to talk to you . Well , they 're not"
270,275,talking to you now . The first word floodgates . I truly believe that
275,280,"the first word acts as a floodgate . You know , once you said the first word"
280,285,"everything else just flows . So keep it simple . A "" Hi , "" a "" Hey , "" a """
285,290,"Hello . "" And do what every good bowler does . Just"
290,295,"gather the enthusiasm , the positivity , the energy , put on a"
295,300,"big smile and say , "" Hi ! "" I know . There 's"
300,305,"going to be that strange moment right now . Turn to someone sitting next to you , stick your"
305,310,hand out and say hello . Go on .
310,315,"I love the awkward laughter . "" Why is she"
315,320,"making us do this ? "" The first word floodgates ."
320,325,"You know , here 's a challenge we face every day ."
325,330,"Time . We have 90 seconds on radio , and we have to make that conversation"
330,335,with a stranger memorable . So how do you do it ? What 's the
335,340,"biggest challenge ? Honestly , if we get stuck in"
340,345,"the rut of : "" Hi ! "" "" Hey ! "" "" How are you ? "" "" I 'm fine . "" "" What"
345,350,"'s going on ? "" "" Nothing much . "" "" Same old . "" "" So tell me what 's new ? "" There"
350,355,"you go , 45 seconds down , wasted . Right ? So , here 's my"
355,360,advice : skip the small talk and ask a really personal question . And do n't be
360,365,afraid . Trust me . You will be surprised how much people are
365,370,willing to share if you just ask . So ask any kind of personal
370,375,question . Interesting name . How did your parents think of it ? Is there
375,380,a story behind it ? Or ... How long have you lived in this city ? And do you remember
380,385,the first day you landed here ? Answers to those questions are always
385,390,"something unique , always something personal . My"
390,395,favorite one to try is : Where do you come from ? And where does your family live ?
395,400,"Unfailingly , every single time I sit in a cab , I do this . I ask that question ."
400,405,Where do you come from ? And where does your family live ? Let me tell you a little story . I was
405,410,"coming home one night ... I get into this taxi , open the door , sit down and I"
410,415,"say , "" Where are you from ? Where does your family live ? "" And the 60 - year - old Pakistani cab - driver goes on to"
415,420,"tell me all about his life in Peshawar . We talked about politics , we"
420,425,"talked about music , family , wife , his farm . And 20"
425,430,minutes later he is convinced that I am the perfect bride for his 26 -
430,435,year - old college - educated son from Peshawar . And as I 'm getting out of
435,440,"the taxi , he is taking out a passport - sized photograph with this look of"
440,445,"enthusiasm . I have to say , it was a very difficult goodbye . But the moral of the story ,"
445,450,"really , is what starts with a "" Hello "" can end with a marriage proposal . And"
450,455,that is a warning . Step
455,460,"three . Find the "" me too""s . Have you"
460,465,"ever met someone who starts a conversation like they 're starting a debate ? "" I am from"
465,470,"Delhi . "" "" I hate Delhi . "" Yeah ? Nothing kills a"
470,475,conversation like a negative . When you meet someone for the first time make an effort to
475,480,find the one thing that you and that other person might have in common . When you
480,485,"start at that point and then move outward from there , you will find that all of a"
485,490,sudden the conversation becomes a lot easier . And that 's because both of
490,495,you suddenly are on the same side of something . And
495,500,"that 's a really powerful feeling . Now , what could you"
500,505,"possibly have in common with a stranger you ask ? Could be anything , right ? You"
505,510,"'re both in the same place at the same time , maybe you 're from the same country ,"
510,515,maybe you both like the winter or you 're longing for it to rain . I do n't
515,520,"know , you 'd find something . When you find a "" me too , "" you"
520,525,"automatically have a kind of buy - in from the other person . Trust me , that"
525,530,'s helpful . Pay a unique compliment .
530,535,"I read somewhere that people will forget what you do , and they 'll"
535,540,"forget what you say , but they will never forget how you made them feel . So"
540,545,be generous . And go out and give someone a
545,550,"nice full compliment . So , I have this belief"
550,555,"about a "" compliment immunity meter "" , and it comes from this experience I had"
555,560,"when I met this gorgeous supermodel . And I look at her and I say , "" Wow ! You are"
560,565,"beautiful ! "" And there is no reaction on her face . And I"
565,570,"think to myself , "" How ? "" That 's when I realized , she is"
570,575,"immune to the word "" beautiful . "" She 's probably heard it a hundred thousand times today ."
575,580,"And if she 's on social media , she 's heard it a million times today ."
580,585,"There are some words that each of us have developed an immunity to . It could be "" nice , "" it"
585,590,"could be "" awesome , "" it could be "" cool "" ... Stay away from these . Try"
590,595,"and construct a compliment that 's unique and genuine , and you do n't"
595,600,"have to lie . Really . When you look at someone and say , "" I love how"
600,605,"when you smile , it 's like your nose smiles , and then your eyes smile , and your ears smile ,"
605,610,"even your forehead smiles and suddenly , the whole person is just smiling . "" You"
610,615,"see , I hope that 's a compliment you 're not going to forget for a while ."
615,620,Pay a unique and genuine compliment .
620,625,Ask for an opinion . All of us have
625,630,opinions ; trust me . And we all want them to be heard and everybody wants
630,635,"validation . So go on and ask for an opinion , and that 's when"
635,640,you open up a two - way street . That is when the real communication
640,645,"begins , and you will be surprised how much you can pick up about a person just by asking their"
645,650,opinion on something pretty generic . Here 's a mistake
650,655,that some people make . They ask your opinion about something really
655,660,"difficult . It feels almost intimidating . Somewhere in a room , full of very well -"
660,665,"informed people , and someone was to come up to me and say , "" So what do you think"
665,670,"about the way the oil prices have affected the real estate market in Dubai ? """
670,675,"I feel a bit cornered . I feel like I might fail , and this is an"
675,680,"examination , and that 's the lesson . Nobody needs to fail at a first - time"
680,685,conversation . Just ask something simple . Keep it generic . How do you like your
685,690,coffee ? When did you watch your last movie ? What did you think of it ? And when somebody gives you
690,695,their opinion : really listen . Do n't listen to
695,700,reply . Listen to listen . There 's a difference . And that brings me
700,705,to my next point . Be present . I
705,710,"know you 've been through this . I know I have . You 're pouring your heart out to someone , and they"
710,715,"are like this , "" Yeah , yeah , go on , keep talking . I can multitask !"
715,720,"What 's with Wi - Fi ? "" You know , when"
720,725,"someone 's trying to communicate with you , the least you can do is really be in that conversation . Just"
725,730,"be wholeheartedly present , just be there ."
730,735,"And oh ! my favorite part : make eye contact . Trust me , eye"
735,740,contact is where all the magic happens . You can feel the
740,745,"conversation . And trust me , when you are looking at someone in the eye , nine out"
745,750,"of ten times , they will not dare look away , right ?"
750,755,"Now , if only I could look into the eyes of 1.6 million people , I would"
755,760,not have to worry about you guys tuning out during the ad breaks .
760,765,"That brings me to this , my favorite point because I"
765,770,"think it 's got a catchy name . Name , place , animal , thing ."
770,775,You remember that game ? Remember the little details about a
775,780,person . Remember their name . It 's so important . It 's awful when you meet someone
780,785,"for 18th time , and you say , "" You must be Paul , no Peter . Something with"
785,790,"the P and it ends with ... "" It 's terrible ."
790,795,Remember someone 's name and say it back to them . You have no idea how important
795,800,"you 're making them feel , and that 's not the only detail . Remember all the other details as well . The"
800,805,"places they like to go to , the places they 've been to , the places they want"
805,810,"to go to , their pet 's names . How their pet 's been feeling lately ? The things"
810,815,"they like . Remember their children 's names , that 's such a winner . Remember their wife 's names ,"
815,820,their girlfriend 's names . Just do n't mix up the last two because that could be disastrous .
820,825,"Remember these little things about people and repeat it back to them , ask"
825,830,"be genuinely interested , and automatically you kind of become an"
830,835,"investor in their well - being , so they 'll feel responsible to you to keep that"
835,840,conversation going . There we go . Seven amazing ways that you
840,845,"can make conversation with anyone , and seven reasons why you should use the break"
845,850,that 's going to come up to talk to a stranger that you do n't know . I
850,855,'m going to end with this analogy . A
855,860,conversation is like reading a book . You can turn to any page you want .
860,865,You can flip to your favorite chapter . You can
865,870,"read as long as you want , and you can read what you want , and every person ,"
870,875,"trust me , is a really good book . And it saddens"
875,880,me so much that entire human lives are being boiled down to 140
880,885,characters and catchy headlines . Because that 's
885,890,not what we are . We are not abridged versions . We
890,895,are entire human stories . We deserve more from each other . So what are
895,900,you going to do in this big world we call the library ? Are you
900,905,"going to walk around , look at the hard bound copies and read the titles ?"
905,910,"Or are you going to actually reach for a book ,"
910,915,open a page and start reading a story ?
915,920,You decide . Thank you .
