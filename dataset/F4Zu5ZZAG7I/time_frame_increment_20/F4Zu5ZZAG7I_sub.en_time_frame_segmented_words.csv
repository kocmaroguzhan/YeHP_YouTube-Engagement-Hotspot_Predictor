0,20,"Hello , everybody . I 'm going to start with a question . How many of you know the person sitting next to you from before today ?"
20,40,"Interesting . So , do you remember the first conversation that you ever had with that person ? You know conversations are links . Let 's imagine every conversation to be a tiny metal link . And every time you talk to a stranger , a metal link is formed ."
40,60,"And every conversation that you have after that moment , the link gets stronger and stronger . And every day each one of us meets so many strangers : the grocery guy , the cab guy maybe the receptionist at a new office you went to . And with every"
60,80,"conversation we build new links . Until finally at the end , we 've created a kind of massive World Wide Web of conversation . World Wide Web . It 's a catchy word . I think I 've heard that somewhere . That 's it ,"
80,100,right ? A conversation . It 's a fascinating thing . A conversation is an adventure . A conversation gives you a whole new perspective . A conversation opens a door . Conversations can make war and conversations can make peace . And conversations define who
100,120,we are as a human race . Think about this . Every single person in your life was once a stranger to you . And you knew nothing about them until you had that first conversation . So I 'm here today to tell you to talk to
120,140,"strangers , to have a conversation . And I 'm here to tell you how . Seven ways that you can make a conversation with almost anyone . I 'm a radio presenter and I love talking to people . I do . I love"
140,160,"it . And I 'm so glad that I do it for a living . Here 's what my day is like . Every single morning , I go into an empty room , I put on a mic , and I have a conversation with 1.6 million people ... that I ca n't see . Yeah . You"
160,180,"know what the hardest part is , though ? It 's time . In a four - hour show , I get 20 minutes . That 's all the talk there is . And in 20 minutes I have to convince you that I am your best friend . How do I do that ? How do I establish a"
180,200,"connection ? I have 20 minutes to inform you , to excite you , to engage with you but most importantly , 20 out of the 20 times that I switch on that mic , I have to leave a smile on your face . Except , I ca n't see you , I know nothing about you , and I have no"
200,220,"way of gauging your reactions . How do you do it ? How do you talk to a stranger ? Well , my nine years in radio have taught me these simple little tricks . Strangers , they are everywhere . And we 've"
220,240,"always been told , "" Do n't talk to strangers ! "" But I beg to differ . Every stranger comes with an opportunity , an opportunity to learn something new , an opportunity to have an experience you 've never had or hear a story that you 've never heard before . And you 've"
240,260,"had that moment , right ? You 're in the room with someone you do n't know , and you look across the room , you see a stranger , and you think , "" I want to talk to this person . "" And you can almost hear the first word but it just wo n't come out , it kind of gets stuck about here , it kind of goes up and down and you do"
260,280,"n't know - You know what ? Here 's my advice : just say it . What 's the worst that can happen ? They want to talk to you . Well , they 're not talking to you now . The first word floodgates . I truly believe that the first word acts as a floodgate . You know , once you said the first word"
280,300,"everything else just flows . So keep it simple . A "" Hi , "" a "" Hey , "" a "" Hello . "" And do what every good bowler does . Just gather the enthusiasm , the positivity , the energy , put on a big smile and say , "" Hi ! "" I know . There 's"
300,320,"going to be that strange moment right now . Turn to someone sitting next to you , stick your hand out and say hello . Go on . I love the awkward laughter . "" Why is she making us do this ? "" The first word floodgates ."
320,340,"You know , here 's a challenge we face every day . Time . We have 90 seconds on radio , and we have to make that conversation with a stranger memorable . So how do you do it ? What 's the biggest challenge ? Honestly , if we get stuck in"
340,360,"the rut of : "" Hi ! "" "" Hey ! "" "" How are you ? "" "" I 'm fine . "" "" What 's going on ? "" "" Nothing much . "" "" Same old . "" "" So tell me what 's new ? "" There you go , 45 seconds down , wasted . Right ? So , here 's my advice : skip the small talk and ask a really personal question . And do n't be"
360,380,afraid . Trust me . You will be surprised how much people are willing to share if you just ask . So ask any kind of personal question . Interesting name . How did your parents think of it ? Is there a story behind it ? Or ... How long have you lived in this city ? And do you remember
380,400,"the first day you landed here ? Answers to those questions are always something unique , always something personal . My favorite one to try is : Where do you come from ? And where does your family live ? Unfailingly , every single time I sit in a cab , I do this . I ask that question ."
400,420,"Where do you come from ? And where does your family live ? Let me tell you a little story . I was coming home one night ... I get into this taxi , open the door , sit down and I say , "" Where are you from ? Where does your family live ? "" And the 60 - year - old Pakistani cab - driver goes on to tell me all about his life in Peshawar . We talked about politics , we"
420,440,"talked about music , family , wife , his farm . And 20 minutes later he is convinced that I am the perfect bride for his 26 - year - old college - educated son from Peshawar . And as I 'm getting out of the taxi , he is taking out a passport - sized photograph with this look of"
440,460,"enthusiasm . I have to say , it was a very difficult goodbye . But the moral of the story , really , is what starts with a "" Hello "" can end with a marriage proposal . And that is a warning . Step three . Find the "" me too""s . Have you"
460,480,"ever met someone who starts a conversation like they 're starting a debate ? "" I am from Delhi . "" "" I hate Delhi . "" Yeah ? Nothing kills a conversation like a negative . When you meet someone for the first time make an effort to find the one thing that you and that other person might have in common . When you"
480,500,"start at that point and then move outward from there , you will find that all of a sudden the conversation becomes a lot easier . And that 's because both of you suddenly are on the same side of something . And that 's a really powerful feeling . Now , what could you"
500,520,"possibly have in common with a stranger you ask ? Could be anything , right ? You 're both in the same place at the same time , maybe you 're from the same country , maybe you both like the winter or you 're longing for it to rain . I do n't know , you 'd find something . When you find a "" me too , "" you"
520,540,"automatically have a kind of buy - in from the other person . Trust me , that 's helpful . Pay a unique compliment . I read somewhere that people will forget what you do , and they 'll forget what you say , but they will never forget how you made them feel . So"
540,560,"be generous . And go out and give someone a nice full compliment . So , I have this belief about a "" compliment immunity meter "" , and it comes from this experience I had when I met this gorgeous supermodel . And I look at her and I say , "" Wow ! You are"
560,580,"beautiful ! "" And there is no reaction on her face . And I think to myself , "" How ? "" That 's when I realized , she is immune to the word "" beautiful . "" She 's probably heard it a hundred thousand times today . And if she 's on social media , she 's heard it a million times today ."
580,600,"There are some words that each of us have developed an immunity to . It could be "" nice , "" it could be "" awesome , "" it could be "" cool "" ... Stay away from these . Try and construct a compliment that 's unique and genuine , and you do n't have to lie . Really . When you look at someone and say , "" I love how"
600,620,"when you smile , it 's like your nose smiles , and then your eyes smile , and your ears smile , even your forehead smiles and suddenly , the whole person is just smiling . "" You see , I hope that 's a compliment you 're not going to forget for a while . Pay a unique and genuine compliment ."
620,640,"Ask for an opinion . All of us have opinions ; trust me . And we all want them to be heard and everybody wants validation . So go on and ask for an opinion , and that 's when you open up a two - way street . That is when the real communication"
640,660,"begins , and you will be surprised how much you can pick up about a person just by asking their opinion on something pretty generic . Here 's a mistake that some people make . They ask your opinion about something really difficult . It feels almost intimidating . Somewhere in a room , full of very well -"
660,680,"informed people , and someone was to come up to me and say , "" So what do you think about the way the oil prices have affected the real estate market in Dubai ? "" I feel a bit cornered . I feel like I might fail , and this is an examination , and that 's the lesson . Nobody needs to fail at a first - time"
680,700,conversation . Just ask something simple . Keep it generic . How do you like your coffee ? When did you watch your last movie ? What did you think of it ? And when somebody gives you their opinion : really listen . Do n't listen to reply . Listen to listen . There 's a difference . And that brings me
700,720,"to my next point . Be present . I know you 've been through this . I know I have . You 're pouring your heart out to someone , and they are like this , "" Yeah , yeah , go on , keep talking . I can multitask ! What 's with Wi - Fi ? "" You know , when"
720,740,"someone 's trying to communicate with you , the least you can do is really be in that conversation . Just be wholeheartedly present , just be there . And oh ! my favorite part : make eye contact . Trust me , eye contact is where all the magic happens . You can feel the"
740,760,"conversation . And trust me , when you are looking at someone in the eye , nine out of ten times , they will not dare look away , right ? Now , if only I could look into the eyes of 1.6 million people , I would not have to worry about you guys tuning out during the ad breaks ."
760,780,"That brings me to this , my favorite point because I think it 's got a catchy name . Name , place , animal , thing . You remember that game ? Remember the little details about a person . Remember their name . It 's so important . It 's awful when you meet someone"
780,800,"for 18th time , and you say , "" You must be Paul , no Peter . Something with the P and it ends with ... "" It 's terrible . Remember someone 's name and say it back to them . You have no idea how important you 're making them feel , and that 's not the only detail . Remember all the other details as well . The"
800,820,"places they like to go to , the places they 've been to , the places they want to go to , their pet 's names . How their pet 's been feeling lately ? The things they like . Remember their children 's names , that 's such a winner . Remember their wife 's names , their girlfriend 's names . Just do n't mix up the last two because that could be disastrous ."
820,840,"Remember these little things about people and repeat it back to them , ask be genuinely interested , and automatically you kind of become an investor in their well - being , so they 'll feel responsible to you to keep that conversation going . There we go . Seven amazing ways that you"
840,860,"can make conversation with anyone , and seven reasons why you should use the break that 's going to come up to talk to a stranger that you do n't know . I 'm going to end with this analogy . A conversation is like reading a book . You can turn to any page you want ."
860,880,"You can flip to your favorite chapter . You can read as long as you want , and you can read what you want , and every person , trust me , is a really good book . And it saddens me so much that entire human lives are being boiled down to 140"
880,900,characters and catchy headlines . Because that 's not what we are . We are not abridged versions . We are entire human stories . We deserve more from each other . So what are you going to do in this big world we call the library ? Are you
900,920,"going to walk around , look at the hard bound copies and read the titles ? Or are you going to actually reach for a book , open a page and start reading a story ? You decide . Thank you ."
