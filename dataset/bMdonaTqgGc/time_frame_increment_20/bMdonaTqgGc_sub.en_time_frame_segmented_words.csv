0,20,"Skid Row a hellscape in downtown Los Angeles with deadly police shooting in La Skid Row where more than 5,000 homeless people crowd the streets tents line the sidewalks addiction and mental illness run wild and crime is at an all - time high in Skid Row survival is the only goal I 've been coming to La my entire life I 've never"
20,40,seen streets that look like this today I want to document the shocking reality in Skid Row but also shine a light on these people 's dignity because homelessness is not exactly what you think it is Skid Row is a 50 block area in downtown Los Angeles holding one of the
40,60,"largest populations of homeless people in the United States with over 5,000 residents living in encampments many of them are addicted to drugs but the lack of Mental Health Services leaves many without the support they need putting them in a cycle of adversity that is hard to break I heard about one organization that provides food Medical Care and shelter to vulnerable people in skid row it 's called"
60,80,called Midnight Mission and I 'm about to meet up with Dante and Heidi two volunteers who were drawn to work here because they both know firsthand what it is like to be without a home really what our goal is to go out of business right if we can just get everybody housed and where they need to be we could shut the doors that would be the best thing together Dante and Heidi are going to show me around the most
80,100,dangerous streets in America so most people when they hear the word skid R they immediately think like danger what 's your response to that well everywhere 's dangerous sure I agree with that so of course it 's dangerous yeah but uh not as dangerous as it 's as it 's put out to be the violence is rising because we 're getting so many other people from different places and they 're bringing
100,120,different energy attacks you know like uh people being hit with poles or stabbings and things like this it 's just starting to rise up and then the summertime too usually around the summer you know people get hotter frustrated and and things happen hey you all right bro oh he breathing we 'll do well inness checks and they 'll be laying like that dying you 've seen just dead people of
120,140,often of course often my second year working here every other week I came to work someone was OD in a tent somewhere or when we go around to do Wellness checks in the morning wake people up we would have two or three people died and then when it got cold we had a couple people die uh from freezing freezing yeah more people die of
140,160,hypothermia on the streets of Los Angeles than in New York cuz New York has the you know the right to shelter so they 'll have shelter but here people do n't think about it so each 10 is a home for one person or or sometimes two people or or a person in their dog can see tense and tense and tense here on the sidewalks homes for the people guess it 's a bit more shelter than
160,180,just a tent yeah if it rains or something well for the rain they 're real resourceful though you see the tarps yeah that for the rain so crazy walking around these streets just lot of simulation everywhere people coming up to you I 'm literally shocked right now I do n't know what to think you want to talk to us for a second about your experiences being down here on uh ski road yeah what
180,200,'s your name Jan number one skid R dancer number one skid rad dancer she really is she is the best dancer Number One You 're Number Two really what is it like to live in SK uh it 's cool we we get everything down here we get a blessing every day so have you always been a dancer or is it something that
200,220,you just learned while you I I grew up dancing like Michael Jackson I was at home watching them and I 'll be at home practicing with them you know they getting down I 'm getting down with hey what 's the best and the worst thing about living here the best thing I just love downtown cuz I am number one and what 's the worst thing about living here when they
220,240,get the um fighting and stuff you know somebody hating on somebody you know for what I do n't know I seen another man take his light right there at that building right there he jumped I was right there by the midnight he was way at the top how he got up there in that building look how it 's blocked off you know that that was strange to me for real think it 's time
240,260,we should see some of your dance moves okay okay from the middle like a rocket give me a b I 'm a I 'm a rocket feeling like Rocky in my pockets maning
260,280,they try to Everyday occurrence they get a call the fire department here in skidrow a call every 7 Seconds true I mean we 've heard a bunch of ambulance so far but damn that 's crazy every seven seconds you see here this is the police station yeah I was going to ask about make them this is the police station this is the police
280,300,station there was a guy that was shot in the head right here like right here in front of the police station right in front of the police station and they do n't do anything and they did n't catch the guy they did n't just shot it started to even be harder to get the police to come out they asked so many questions before even yeah well hey we got a guy that was a SED hey is he bleeding how old is he is he can he talk can he stand
300,320,can he 's like hey just come out and come see about it yeah how are you my best friend God bless you God bless you too good to see God bless you God bless you too all right hi what 's going on over here probably a testing site diabetes testing they got some covid tests there it 's open for anyone so this is yeah la Christian Health Center come they just
320,340,roll up on a corner and everybody can roll up on a corner and everybody can come out and for food I 'm guessing people make food they dumpster dive what 's what 's the food situation like the missions make it where they do n't have to dumpster dive but a lot of them still do I guess when you get used to something or custom something that 's just what they 'll do like this right legi here it 's so crazy that in right there you just see these huge Banks like
340,360,right here right here from from SK R yeah such a contrast did you know that LA county has the largest population of poverty homelessness and also the largest population of billionaires really mhm not much in between not much they 're cutting out middle class they 're cutting middle class is yeah it 's done it 's yeah
360,380,skidrow is an extreme example of America 's shrinking middle class over the past few decades wages have stagnated while the cost of living has soared the gap between rich and poor widens pushing many into Financial turmoil and even homelessness in fact the share of adults who live in middle class households fell from 61 to 50 % in the last 50 years
380,400,Skyhigh housing prices crippling healthcare costs and mounting student debt push more people into poverty making places like Skid Row symbols of a larger economic struggle oh you can just set up a tent anywhere there 's no Ru like they 're not supposed to set the tents up until like I think about 6:00 but nobody 's stopping them they do n't have enough manpower I do n't believe to enforce and it would probably start a
400,420,ride is it growing or shrinking growing growing growing if you ask any homeless person in La if they do n't live here like what 's the reputation of good road dangerous drugs the lowest of the low what percentage of of people out here are are on drugs every day a lot of it stems from another problem you know most of the time mental health Lost to
420,440,house or family put you out and then being here you 're going to try something and then sure I think that 's where the stuck process comes a lot of people come down here not intending on staying here you know yeah what happens here at nighttime what 's the vibe like on the streets it 's a different vibe nighttime everybody 's up that 's when a lot of people are using or seeking to use or going to get money to use you know
440,460,so sure it 's vital that more people join this conversation and spread awareness about the same and that 's where nid AI comes in nid AI is the world 's most popular AI Video Creator with over 10 million users across 150 countries it 's my favorite AI Video Creator because it put me in the driver 's seat and it works as my personal sidekick to help with
460,480,Annoying tasks like scripting editing and finding all the footage that brings my ideas to life all you have to do is start with a simple text prompt and it creates the first rough draft for you hey everyone ever wondered how cultures in Asia and Europe stack up against each other from there you can get creative and fine - tune your video using simple text prompts in more ways than you 'd imagine want

520,540,all right how you fellas doing how you guys doing good morning she said they took my tent I think that 's what she said yeah the police took her tent I do n't know oh yeah see this is what they do they come every other Wednesday yeah and they 'll clean up the streets whose day uh the city the police will come out with the
540,560,city and they 'll just they 'll just city and they 'll just they 'll just remove people 's tents they just remove the T that 's not cool that 's their home yeah you 'll hear of a sweep this is a sweep cuz literally they 're sweeping and it sucks cuz there a double - edged sword of course you want businesses clean but then you want to let people that already do n't have homes have home somewhere to sleep warm so human life is human life you know so sweeps on
560,580,Skid Row are city - led cleanups where officials clear out homeless camps residents must pack up and move immediately often losing their belongings though meant to improve safety sweeps are controversial critics say they just shift the problem around without fixing it instead of helping these sweeps often make life harder for the homeless pushing them further into despair how you doing
580,600,Texas hi what 's up Pekka how are you they 're coming on this side after can we help her we could Let 's help her let 's help her Tanaya can we help you can we help you now we going to help you move the tent it 's okay you sure sure all right okay

620,640,order to keep a job you got to get your knees dirty and chiss what 's the best and the worst part about living here the best part about it you ai n't got a chiss you do or nothing behind the worst part about it is you like me I 'm 7 years old I 've been out here since 2004 back and forth of prison prison is much better than this prison is much
640,660,better than this you get respect in prison but nobody gives you respect here you get robbed I 'm homeless I do n't have any the clothes I got today I got yes he this was clean have you made any friends or people that you call

680,700,90 % male on these streets yeah it 's more male are females do they hang out with other females or do they kind of mix in they kind of mix in some with the women down here it 's a that 's a large spectacle some of them are with guys that they do n't particularly even like but it 's for protection got it you know yeah cuz down here as just a
700,720,woman alone yeah not a good scene especially after hours a lot of things going in these tents that the cops are just passing by you would never know what 's going on you got a lot of predators down here too so you get young women that come down here and hook up with a guy that you know promised him something right clothes or something and a down rad SP spiral so yeah
720,740,so when you see people like this you try to move them or you just let them sleep no I let them sleep yeah yeah so she was having a seizure and someone decided to jump on top of her and rape her and while that was happening the cops came and while the cops came to try to help her somebody had a knife and tried to knife the cops yeah walk
740,760,behind on on this street corner right right here oh my God and she 's still here yeah and she 's still here since you 're talking about women here on the street that 's what happened yeah just seen his targets how you doing man good morning how are you you look really nice pretty yeah thank you you 're welcome would you be interested in sharing
760,780,your story due to a circumstance of me creating incredible incredibly like valuable uh intellectual property as a career they 've been um attempting to murder me over I could use any safety you guys could offer have have you ever heard of the Midnight Mission yeah I do n't want to do any of that stuff because the guy was my
780,800,pay for my federal disability shut it off illegally and was monopolizing the apartment so they basically been trying to pwn me off as a dumb drug addict so uh nice to see you it 's nice to see you we 're going to stay living yes yes so this Parker is cool I was going to Home Depot these things are
800,820,awesome that is pretty cool ones they awesome that is pretty cool ones they like I do my best to have a good time no matter what going on you know yep for sure so the Midnight Mission is a shelter uh couple blocks it 's actually on six in San Pedro but we give out meals three meals a day and we have
820,840,showers and restrooms and we do have uh women 's we have women 's shelter it does n't cost anything everything that we do is completely free well they 've tried to hurt me more than once I get a little nervous about that I understand that 's why like you know what I I they made a lot of money and they exploited me and made me look MH like
840,860,something I 'm not well if you decide you want to we got guys like Dante and Michael over there they 're our security so we have security 24/7 okay so you would be safe well do they do that there do they electrocute people no it is heartbreaking that some residents refuse help due to past mistreatment it is true that mental health issues on Skid Row are a crisis within a crisis over
860,880,one - third of residents suffer from severe illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder the area is a mental health desert with Services stretched too thin to meet overwhelming demand untreated conditions worsen in the chaotic environment without stable housing regular treatment is nearly impossible Outreach programs and Clinics struggle to cope leading to public breakdowns self
880,900,harm and violent outbursts the situation shows a desperate need for Comprehensive Mental Health Care and housing Solutions highlighting severe societal neglect I got some good people here they wanted to see if you wanted to just share like two minutes of what it 's been like to be on skid rad be down here oh yeah absolutely I guess Big Russ is your name that 's what they call you yeah
900,920,Russell Big Russ what 's the best and the worst part about living in skid R uh the best part is there okay so Freedom no expectations no responsibilities some of us do n't handle responsibility very well which is me and then the worst thing is any second you know you can lose your life you know over something as simple
920,940,as somebody wanting your shoes how do you deal with those situations that are life and death the best thing you can possibly do is turn around and walk away any form of confrontation at all can lead to you losing your life have you found many friends here I know this sounds bad but different streets are owned by different like clicks or different um they like to
940,960,call themselves a family which in a sense they are you know they protect each other like before I uh went into where I 'm staying now I lived on Wall Street you did next street over which is one of the worst streets like Crocker if you 're not family they let you know immediately that you 're there only as a customer interesting before
960,980,you were living on wall and here what were you doing uh I used to be a coder do you still have a passion for that or do you think you could still code someday oh yeah I could still code but the thing is you know where I have a problem with you know responsibility either people depending on me or me depending on them it forms a lot a lot of anxiety and that 's why living on the street or living in a
980,1000,shelter or whatever is a little more easier for me where do you see yourself in 5 years from now I should have my own apartment you know which is coming within 60 to 90 days and and it 'll be a Section 8 in housing good for you it 's not bad 5 years from now I should have a non - demanding job one that does n't require like a quota or a Time based you

1180,1200,years yeah 30 years I I 'm 32 so I mean yeah ca n't even imagine the last thing you said was I 'm not crazy yet how how do you do that where you going that picture that you just I 'm not recording anything like I said suing everybody that was interesting going
1200,1220,to be down at this new place what 's going on kind of walking through a busy street here I know right a lot of action around here can you share more about your own personal story like you 're from Compton what what was it like growing up there well for me it was it was like I told you it 's dangerous everywhere sure so of course there was danger gang
1220,1240,violence but it was actually a a beautiful place to grow up I had my uncle uh Stan used to work here but before he worked here when I was younger uh he dealt with drugs and we used to bring food here to the Midnight Mission uh to him you know he called me one day I just left my other job and I was actually looking for work and he asked me did I want to work here
1240,1260,at first my first thing I was like no I 'm not not going a sko but then actually when I came down here this is right where I needed to be I 'm a people 's person yeah you are I like to talk to people and I like to help so you just felt connection here yeah right off Heidi what 's your story what
1260,1280,'s your connection to Skid ow 7even years ago I came out just to on vacation in California and we came down to tour the Midnight Mission and I fell in love with the place I lived in Pennsylvania and so it took me 2 years but then we sold everything we owned and moved out here so that I could possibly work for the Midnight Mission you have such a kind
1280,1300,heart to do that I mean it 's it 's really incredible and you 've been here for so long but clearly you found a lot of joy and happiness and connection out here I love the people I love their stories I feel like it 's my mission to let them know that they matter that their lives matter and if I can be a voice to let other people know that homelessness is n't what you think it is and that these are
1300,1320,human beings like somebody 's mom or brother or sister and think once skro Gets In Your Heart like you ca n't get it out like it 's just it 's there that 's it I 'm I can feel that from both of you we 're in the middle of downtown LA so there 's obviously things adjacent to skin row that other people would visit is there friction so experience for people
1320,1340,coming down here just to like go Mama tacos or something like that I do n't think they have that much trouble how long has goodro been around well the Midnight Mission has been around for 110 years and we are the longest withstanding human services provider like we 've never skidrow was here when the Midnight Mission started skid was here so it 's over 100 years old what
1340,1360,has changed about skidrow more women more women there used to be no tents where were they sleep before uh it really was n't sleeping people were either down here selling drugs or doing them but there were no like tens and laying this is just an area where you would come do it and then they would dispersed it when I I remember when I was younger coming down here it were n't any tense like people just laid out on the streets how we 're
1360,1380,seeing now n it was n't tense I will say we we 've walked a lot of the streets already and I do n't really feel like I 'm in danger like I you know I 'm seeing things of course but I 'm not being threatened I 'm not being attacked this is what I 'm saying and people like everyone I know that would say I 'm not going there I 'm not going there yeah you have to be here to understand if people do work what are their typical jobs here in
1380,1400,Skid Row well depending on a lot of them go into cleaning a place called Chris lives here where they hire a lot and most of the homeless they 'll they do get jobs they 'll go there and that 's another uh Mis like people think ah these people down here they do n't want to work or they do n't have a job and it 's not true a lot of people work and that 's why like we
1400,1420,have a mail center so they can have an address in order for you know a job application it 's not just about getting a job see they 're cleaning the streets behind me that 's their job it 's nice to see people working I like that are people like selling stuff too like on the street well they try to make their money that way some of them have uh you know chips or whatever they can get their hands on some of
1420,1440,them come go to the missions and get like tennis shoes and stuff like that right and then they 'll come out here and try to sell it to make some extra money or whatever it 's cool I like to see all the flags here yeah this here is the uh Joshua house you know a lot of them do n't have insurance to get their teeth pulled STDs whatever right everybody does n't have insurance to Joshua house will take before the pandemic we would charge phones
1440,1460,but I believe they can go to the bin or the refresh Center got it and they can charge their phone wash their clothes and things like that what 's that are you working no I work at the Midnight Mission okay hi how you doing that guy asked me if I was with Section 8 so they want Section 8 vouchers cuz if you have a voucher then when housing comes available you can get housing
1460,1480,the problem is people have vouchers and they 've been waiting for a year like people will be in our crisis in Bridge Center with a voucher they are approved for housing but there is no housing a lot of people were housed last year but the rate of people that are becoming homeless is greater than the rate that they can house ca n't catch up yeah meeting people on Skid Row is eye openening and
1480,1500,heart - wrenching hearing their stories of struggle and survival hits me hard I feel a mix of sadness and determination knowing how much must be done to help these people as I continue to walk around I notice a blind man approaching tapping his walking stick he is kind enough to answer a few questions what made you want to come to Skid Row I do n't have nobody to help me and I ca n't hear CU
1500,1520,there was help in SK do you like the community here I do n't like how the the police manage over here and how the city manage over here because the city helps but does n't manage what 's the drug problem like on skid many everyone 's taking drugs drugs they there 's
1520,1540,alcohol there uh marijuana it 's uh it 's a crystal cocaine it 's heroine as a blind man I imagine it 's more difficult to be here because there 's more danger yeah you see like the city make a stupid thing to build that that kind of stuff over there in the street we do n't need a kind of ched around here I have better imagination
1540,1560,than the city I fail over there because there stupid things over there what do you want the government to do to fix the streets the money they spend in that sidewalks over there they they can fix the the sidewalks we need a kind of token in the lights like in Santa Monica in different cities they got all that kind of stuff hey thanks than a lot for sharing your story man I wish you the
1560,1580,best of luck thanks a lot man appreciate good morning how are you do you like living here you like the people drugs what kind of drugs smoking smoking
1580,1600,weed meth what 's your job you working sure right nice to meet you byebye yeah of course so here there 's a bunch of clothes that they 're giving out people lining up and taking whatever you want
1600,1620,and this is all vegan food uh Chef he worked at the Midnight Mission and he his his dream is to bring bigan nutritious food to the people of skid and so that 's what he does like that 's his do you think they know it 's nutritious maybe maybe not if people watching this video want to help the community here what can to do I would say whatever it is if you
1620,1640,wanted to bring clothes shoes or even just come down here and motivate people talking this works too you would n't believe how many people here it 's like talking to people how we 're going around just talking bro but for the most part I would say this type of stuff coming down interacting giving them something that they 're actually going to use the things that most people that we take for granted socks and stuff take yeah yeah
1640,1660,down here shoes like the guy Russell told you you can die for a pair of shoes down here that 's how how much is needed so you would n't believe how many people that drive past people like oh hey what 's up what 's up King how you doing dirty homeless people and know these are people with stories like talking to that 's my mission for coming here exactly like they are people they have hopes and dreams and you know they want the same
1660,1680,thing we want exactly exactly means a lot I appreciate you even doing of course man thanks for for showing showing me around yeah I mean coming by myself I do n't know it 'd be a little intimidating to walk alone exactly just you know the streets and the culture yeah spending a day in Skid Row talking to Residents and witnessing the dire condition firstand I 'm left with a
1680,1700,profound sense of urgency I want to use my platform to show you what it 's like because we can no longer turn a blind eye to this crisis this experience has shown me the Deep flaws in our system it 's not just about providing shelter it 's about addressing mental health addiction and the systemic issues that perpetuate homelessness we need to implement policies that treat the homeless with dignity and respect Community
1700,1720,involvement is crucial volunteer donate advocate for Change and support organizations like Midnight Mission who work around the clock to make a difference skid WR is a reminder of our Collective responsibility it 's time to turn empathy into action and work towards a future where everyone has a safe place to call home let 's not just hope for change let 's make it happen thank you for
1720,1740,watching
