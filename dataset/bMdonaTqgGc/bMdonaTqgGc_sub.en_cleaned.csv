0.199,2.79,Skid Row a hellscape in downtown Los
2.8,4.59,Angeles with deadly police shooting in
4.6,6.869,"La Skid Row where more than 5,000"
6.879,8.91,homeless people crowd the streets tents
8.92,11.19,line the sidewalks addiction and mental
11.2,13.589,illness run wild and crime is at an
13.599,16.51,all-time high in Skid Row survival is
16.52,18.67,the only goal I've been coming to La my
18.68,20.83,entire life I've never seen streets that
20.84,23.269,look like this today I want to document
23.279,25.39,the shocking reality in Skid Row but
25.4,27.109,also shine a light on these people's
27.119,29.23,dignity because homelessness is not
29.24,32.85,exactly what you think it
34.84,37.99,is Skid Row is a 50 block area in
38.0,39.83,downtown Los Angeles holding one of the
39.84,41.59,largest populations of homeless people
41.6,43.91,"in the United States with over 5,000"
43.92,45.83,residents living in encampments many of
45.84,47.79,them are addicted to drugs but the lack
47.8,49.63,of Mental Health Services leaves many
49.64,51.27,without the support they need putting
51.28,53.189,them in a cycle of adversity that is
53.199,54.95,hard to break I heard about one
54.96,57.069,organization that provides food Medical
57.079,58.95,Care and shelter to vulnerable people in
58.96,60.59,skid row it's called called Midnight
60.6,62.11,Mission and I'm about to meet up with
62.12,64.39,Dante and Heidi two volunteers who were
64.4,65.91,drawn to work here because they both
65.92,67.99,know firsthand what it is like to be
68.0,69.63,without a home really what our goal is
69.64,71.39,to go out of business right if we can
71.4,73.39,just get everybody housed and where they
73.4,75.429,need to be we could shut the doors that
75.439,77.87,would be the best thing together Dante
77.88,79.27,and Heidi are going to show me around
79.28,82.149,the most dangerous streets in America so
82.159,83.63,most people when they hear the word skid
83.64,85.71,R they immediately think like danger
85.72,87.31,what's your response to that well
87.32,89.109,everywhere's dangerous sure I agree with
89.119,91.39,that so of course it's dangerous yeah
91.4,93.91,but uh not as dangerous as it's as it's
93.92,96.149,put out to be the violence is rising
96.159,97.149,because we're getting so many other
97.159,99.069,people from different places and they're
99.079,100.91,bringing different energy attacks you
100.92,103.069,know like uh people being hit with poles
103.079,104.749,or stabbings and things like this it's
104.759,105.87,just starting to rise up and then the
105.88,107.27,summertime too usually around the summer
107.28,109.749,you know people get hotter frustrated
109.759,113.149,and and things happen hey you all right
113.159,116.109,bro oh he breathing we'll do well inness
116.119,117.35,checks and they'll be laying like that
117.36,119.51,dying you've seen just dead people of
120.439,122.83,often of course often my second year
122.84,125.069,working here every other week I came to
125.079,127.95,work someone was OD in a tent somewhere
127.96,129.19,or when we go around to do Wellness
129.2,131.27,checks in the morning wake people up we
131.28,133.43,would have two or three people died and
133.44,134.67,then when it got cold we had a couple
134.68,137.75,people die uh from freezing freezing
137.76,140.43,yeah more people die of hypothermia on
140.44,142.43,the streets of Los Angeles than in New
142.44,144.589,York cuz New York has the you know the
144.599,146.27,right to shelter so they'll have shelter
146.28,148.71,but here people don't think about it so
148.72,151.35,each 10 is a home for one person or or
151.36,153.27,sometimes two people or or a person in
153.28,155.71,their dog can see tense and tense and
155.72,157.91,tense here on the sidewalks homes for
157.92,159.63,the people guess it's a bit more shelter
159.64,161.55,than just a tent yeah if it rains or
161.56,163.07,something well for the rain they're real
163.08,164.79,resourceful though you see the tarps

276.919,278.79,was going to ask about make them this is
278.8,279.95,the police station this is the police
279.96,281.39,station there was a guy that was shot in
281.4,283.029,the head right here like right here in
283.039,283.83,front of the police station right in
283.84,284.909,front of the police station and they
284.919,286.469,don't do anything and they didn't catch
286.479,289.15,the guy they didn't just shot it started
289.16,290.55,to even be harder to get the police to
290.56,292.749,come out they asked so many questions
292.759,295.43,before even yeah well hey we got a guy
295.44,297.029,that was a SED hey is he bleeding how

313.6,315.87,testing they got some covid tests there
315.88,318.11,it's open for anyone so this is yeah la
318.12,319.99,Christian Health Center come they just
320.0,321.43,roll up on a corner and everybody can
321.44,323.11,come out and for food I'm guessing
323.12,325.15,people make food they dumpster dive
325.16,326.55,what's what's the food situation like
326.56,328.029,the missions make it where they don't
328.039,329.749,have to dumpster dive but a lot of them
329.759,331.309,still do I guess when you get used to
331.319,332.629,something or custom something that's
332.639,334.71,just what they'll do like this right
334.72,337.95,legi here it's so crazy that in right
337.96,339.71,there you just see these huge Banks like
339.72,341.87,right here right here from from SK R
341.88,343.71,yeah such a contrast did you know that
343.72,347.309,LA county has the largest population of
347.319,349.55,poverty homelessness and also the
349.56,352.35,largest population of billionaires
352.36,355.67,really mhm not much in between not much
355.68,356.749,they're cutting out middle class they're
356.759,358.95,cutting middle class is yeah it's done
358.96,361.909,it's yeah skidrow is an extreme example
361.919,364.07,of America's shrinking middle class over
364.08,365.87,the past few decades wages have
365.88,367.629,stagnated while the cost of living has
367.639,369.67,soared the gap between rich and poor
369.68,371.55,widens pushing many into Financial
371.56,374.07,turmoil and even homelessness in fact
374.08,375.67,the share of adults who live in middle
375.68,378.51,class households fell from 61 to 50% in
378.52,381.51,the last 50 years Skyhigh housing prices
381.52,383.35,crippling healthcare costs and mounting
383.36,385.189,student debt push more people into
385.199,387.07,poverty making places like Skid Row
387.08,389.629,symbols of a larger economic struggle oh
389.639,390.99,you can just set up a tent anywhere
391.0,392.27,there's no Ru like they're not supposed
392.28,393.749,to set the tents up until like I think
393.759,396.07,about 6:00 but nobody's stopping them
396.08,397.35,they don't have enough manpower I don't
397.36,399.35,believe to enforce and it would probably
399.36,402.309,start a ride is it growing or shrinking
402.319,404.67,growing growing growing if you ask any
404.68,406.27,homeless person in La if they don't live
406.28,407.749,here like what's the reputation of good
407.759,410.43,road dangerous drugs the lowest of the
410.44,412.39,low what percentage of of people out
412.4,414.67,here are are on drugs every day a lot of
414.68,417.189,it stems from another problem you know
417.199,419.71,most of the time mental health Lost to
419.72,421.95,house or family put you out and then
421.96,423.909,being here you're going to try something
423.919,425.309,and then sure I think that's where the
425.319,427.55,stuck process comes a lot of people come
427.56,429.39,down here not intending on staying here
429.4,430.629,you know yeah what happens here at
430.639,432.27,nighttime what's the vibe like on the
432.28,434.589,streets it's a different vibe nighttime
434.599,436.23,everybody's up that's when a lot of
436.24,438.309,people are using or seeking to use or
438.319,440.029,going to get money to use you know so
440.039,442.029,sure it's vital that more people join
442.039,443.749,this conversation and spread awareness
443.759,446.189,about the same and that's where nid AI
446.199,448.629,comes in nid AI is the world's most

456.199,458.11,put me in the driver's seat and it works
458.12,459.869,as my personal sidekick to help with
459.879,461.99,Annoying tasks like scripting editing

499.199,501.309,a month to start listen I know a lot of
501.319,503.029,people out there see AI as a threat
503.039,504.95,feeling that humans are being replaced
504.96,507.749,by AI but I see tools like nid AI as a
507.759,509.79,way to level up your skills by taking
509.8,511.55,advantage of it it allows you to bring
511.56,513.07,projects to life that would normally
513.08,514.99,seem Out Of Reach all right guys let's
515.0,517.709,get back to the streets of LA good
517.719,519.589,morning how you
519.599,522.029,do all right how you fellas doing how
522.039,526.22,you guys doing good
527.8,530.15,morning she said they took my tent I
530.16,531.59,think that's what she said yeah the
531.6,532.75,police took her tent I don't know oh
532.76,533.87,yeah see this is what they do they come
533.88,535.47,every other Wednesday yeah and they'll
535.48,538.03,clean up the streets whose day uh the
538.04,539.99,city the police will come out with the
540.0,541.47,city and they'll just they'll just
541.48,542.67,remove people's tents they just remove
542.68,544.269,the T that's not cool that's their home
544.279,546.509,yeah you'll hear of a sweep this is a
546.519,549.03,sweep cuz literally they're sweeping and
549.04,550.75,it sucks cuz there a double-edged sword
550.76,552.91,of course you want businesses clean but
552.92,554.509,then you want to let people that already
554.519,556.23,don't have homes have home somewhere to
556.24,558.59,sleep warm so human life is human life
558.6,560.63,you know so sweeps on Skid Row are
560.64,562.55,city-led cleanups where officials clear
562.56,564.67,out homeless camps residents must pack
564.68,566.67,up and move immediately often losing
566.68,568.63,their belongings though meant to improve
568.64,570.91,safety sweeps are controversial critics
570.92,572.509,say they just shift the problem around
572.519,574.35,without fixing it instead of helping
574.36,576.23,these sweeps often make life harder for
576.24,578.069,the homeless pushing them further into
578.079,581.35,despair how you doing Texas hi what's up

776.6,778.23,don't want to do any of that stuff

823.079,825.11,women's we have women's shelter it
825.12,826.67,doesn't cost anything everything that we
826.68,829.23,do is completely free well they've tried
829.24,830.99,to hurt me more than once I get a little
831.0,832.87,nervous about that I understand that's
832.88,835.43,why like you know what I I they made a
835.44,838.59,lot of money and they exploited me and
838.6,840.949,made me look MH like something I'm not
840.959,842.47,well if you decide you want to we got
842.48,844.23,guys like Dante and Michael over there

846.32,848.829,24/7 okay so you would be safe well do
848.839,850.389,they do that there do they electrocute
850.399,852.99,people no it is heartbreaking that
853.0,854.829,some residents refuse help due to past
854.839,856.71,mistreatment it is true that mental
856.72,858.749,health issues on Skid Row are a crisis
858.759,860.71,within a crisis over one-third of
860.72,862.47,residents suffer from severe illnesses
862.48,864.749,like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
864.759,866.749,the area is a mental health desert with
866.759,868.43,Services stretched too thin to meet
868.44,870.509,overwhelming demand untreated conditions
870.519,872.269,worsen in the chaotic environment
872.279,874.389,without stable housing regular treatment
874.399,876.509,is nearly impossible Outreach programs
876.519,878.55,and Clinics struggle to cope leading to
878.56,880.99,public breakdowns self harm and violent
881.0,882.91,outbursts the situation shows a
882.92,884.67,desperate need for Comprehensive Mental
884.68,886.389,Health Care and housing Solutions
886.399,888.79,highlighting severe societal neglect I
888.8,890.189,got some good people here they wanted to
890.199,892.069,see if you wanted to just share like two
892.079,894.389,minutes of what it's been like to be on
894.399,897.189,skid rad be down here oh yeah absolutely
897.199,898.55,I guess Big Russ is your name that's
898.56,900.629,what they call you yeah Russell Big Russ
900.639,902.03,what's the best and the worst part about
902.04,905.59,living in skid R uh the best part is
905.6,909.11,there okay so Freedom no expectations no
909.12,911.67,responsibilities some of us don't handle
911.68,913.67,responsibility very well which is me and
913.68,916.47,then the worst thing is any second you
916.48,918.23,know you can lose your life you know
918.24,920.629,over something as simple as somebody
920.639,922.269,wanting your shoes how do you deal with
922.279,924.55,those situations that are life and death
924.56,926.99,the best thing you can possibly do is
927.0,929.15,turn around and walk away any form of
929.16,931.47,confrontation at all can lead to you
931.48,932.949,losing your life have you found many
932.959,934.99,friends here I know this sounds bad but
935.0,936.99,different streets are owned by different
937.0,939.91,like clicks or different um they like to
939.92,941.71,call themselves a family which in a
941.72,944.15,sense they are you know they protect
944.16,947.47,each other like before I uh went into
947.48,949.749,where I'm staying now I lived on Wall
949.759,952.03,Street you did next street over which is
952.04,954.309,one of the worst streets like Crocker if
954.319,956.309,you're not family they let you know
956.319,958.269,immediately that you're there only as a
958.279,960.389,customer interesting before you were
960.399,961.67,living on wall and here what were you
961.68,963.389,doing uh I used to be a coder do you
963.399,964.67,still have a passion for that or do you
964.68,966.189,think you could still code someday oh
966.199,967.91,yeah I could still code but the thing is
967.92,969.71,you know where I have a problem with you
969.72,971.509,know responsibility either people
971.519,974.069,depending on me or me depending on them
974.079,976.509,it forms a lot a lot of anxiety and
976.519,978.829,that's why living on the street or
978.839,981.269,living in a shelter or whatever is a
981.279,983.189,little more easier for me where do you
983.199,984.749,see yourself in 5 years from now I
984.759,986.509,should have my own apartment you know

1217.039,1218.549,dangerous everywhere sure so of course
1218.559,1220.75,there was danger gang violence but it
1220.76,1222.75,was actually a a beautiful place to grow
1222.76,1225.27,up I had my uncle uh Stan used to work
1225.28,1227.83,here but before he worked here when I
1227.84,1230.63,was younger uh he dealt with drugs and
1230.64,1232.71,we used to bring food here to the
1232.72,1235.35,Midnight Mission uh to him you know he
1235.36,1237.029,called me one day I just left my other
1237.039,1238.63,job and I was actually looking for work
1238.64,1239.83,and he asked me did I want to work here
1239.84,1243.27,at first my first thing I was like no
1243.28,1246.549,I'm not not going a sko but then
1246.559,1248.029,actually when I came down here this is
1248.039,1249.83,right where I needed to be I'm a
1249.84,1252.029,people's person yeah you are I like to
1252.039,1254.31,talk to people and I like to help so you
1254.32,1257.07,just felt connection here yeah right off
1259.0,1260.23,Heidi what's your story what's your
1260.24,1262.71,connection to Skid ow 7even years ago I
1262.72,1265.19,came out just to on vacation in
1265.2,1266.99,California and we came down to tour the
1267.0,1269.87,Midnight Mission and I fell in love with
1269.88,1272.07,the place I lived in Pennsylvania and so
1272.08,1273.95,it took me 2 years but then we sold
1273.96,1276.59,everything we owned and moved out here
1276.6,1278.43,so that I could possibly work for the
1278.44,1279.95,Midnight Mission you have such a kind
1279.96,1281.63,heart to do that I mean it's it's really
1281.64,1282.99,incredible and you've been here for so
1283.0,1284.669,long but clearly you found a lot of joy
1284.679,1286.909,and happiness and connection out here I
1286.919,1289.75,love the people I love their stories I
1289.76,1291.51,feel like it's my mission to let them
1291.52,1293.35,know that they matter that their lives
1293.36,1295.51,matter and if I can be a voice to let
1295.52,1297.149,other people know that homelessness
1297.159,1299.19,isn't what you think it is and that
1299.2,1301.789,these are human beings like somebody's
1301.799,1304.549,mom or brother or sister and think once
1304.559,1306.63,skro Gets In Your Heart like you can't
1306.64,1308.59,get it out like it's just it's there
1308.6,1310.39,that's it I'm I can feel that from both
1310.4,1312.07,of you we're in the middle of downtown
1312.08,1314.59,LA so there's obviously things adjacent
1314.6,1316.71,to skin row that other people would
1316.72,1318.95,visit is there friction so experience
1318.96,1321.31,for people coming down here just to like
1321.32,1323.35,go Mama tacos or something like that I
1323.36,1325.75,don't think they have that much trouble
1325.76,1327.95,how long has goodro been around well the
1327.96,1330.71,Midnight Mission has been around for 110
1330.72,1332.87,years and we are the longest
1332.88,1334.789,withstanding human services provider
1334.799,1336.23,like we've never skidrow was here when
1336.24,1337.87,the Midnight Mission started skid was
1337.88,1340.029,here so it's over 100 years old what has
1340.039,1342.789,changed about skidrow more women more
1342.799,1344.75,women there used to be no tents where
1344.76,1347.149,were they sleep before uh it really
1347.159,1348.75,wasn't sleeping people were either down
1348.76,1350.71,here selling drugs or doing them but
1350.72,1352.43,there were no like tens and laying this
1352.44,1353.99,is just an area where you would come do
1354.0,1355.23,it and then they would dispersed it when
1355.24,1356.39,I I remember when I was younger coming
1356.4,1357.87,down here it weren't any tense like
1357.88,1359.11,people just laid out on the streets how
1359.12,1361.95,we're seeing now n it wasn't tense I
1361.96,1363.23,will say we we've walked a lot of the
1363.24,1364.789,streets already and I don't really feel
1364.799,1366.51,like I'm in danger like I you know I'm
1366.52,1367.95,seeing things of course but I'm not
1367.96,1369.47,being threatened I'm not being attacked
1369.48,1371.19,this is what I'm saying and people like
1371.2,1373.549,everyone I know that would say I'm not
1373.559,1375.029,going there I'm not going there yeah you
1375.039,1377.35,have to be here to understand if people
1377.36,1379.63,do work what are their typical jobs here
1379.64,1383.23,in Skid Row well depending on a lot of
1383.24,1384.71,them go into cleaning a place called
1384.72,1386.789,Chris lives here where they hire a lot
1386.799,1388.63,and most of the homeless they'll they do
1388.64,1390.19,get jobs they'll go there and that's
1390.2,1393.11,another uh Mis like people think ah
1393.12,1394.549,these people down here they don't want
1394.559,1396.51,to work or they don't have a job and
1396.52,1398.95,it's not true a lot of people work and
1398.96,1400.75,that's why like we have a mail center so
1400.76,1402.269,they can have an address in order for
1402.279,1404.63,you know a job application it's not just
1404.64,1406.51,about getting a job see they're cleaning
1406.52,1408.51,the streets behind me that's their job
1408.52,1410.149,it's nice to see people working I like
1410.159,1412.549,that are people like selling stuff too
1412.559,1414.07,like on the street well they try to make
1414.08,1415.59,their money that way some of them have
1415.6,1418.269,uh you know chips or whatever they can
1418.279,1420.51,get their hands on some of them come go
1420.52,1421.95,to the missions and get like tennis
1421.96,1423.549,shoes and stuff like that right and then
1423.559,1424.669,they'll come out here and try to sell it
1424.679,1427.83,to make some extra money or whatever
1427.84,1429.31,it's cool I like to see all the flags
1429.32,1431.789,here yeah this here is the uh Joshua
1431.799,1432.95,house you know a lot of them don't have
1432.96,1435.149,insurance to get their teeth pulled STDs
1435.159,1436.83,whatever right everybody doesn't have
1436.84,1438.43,insurance to Joshua house will take
1438.44,1439.669,before the pandemic we would charge
1439.679,1441.23,phones but I believe they can go to the
1441.24,1443.51,bin or the refresh Center got it and
1443.52,1445.029,they can charge their phone wash their
1445.039,1447.11,clothes and things like that what's that
1447.12,1448.71,are you working no I work at the
1448.72,1450.95,Midnight Mission
1450.96,1453.75,okay hi how you doing that guy asked me
1453.76,1455.59,if I was with Section 8 so they want
1455.6,1457.149,Section 8 vouchers cuz if you have a
1457.159,1458.39,voucher then when housing comes
1458.4,1460.029,available you can get housing the
1460.039,1461.43,problem is people have vouchers and
1461.44,1463.07,they've been waiting for a year like
1463.08,1464.83,people will be in our crisis in Bridge
1464.84,1467.31,Center with a voucher they are approved
1467.32,1469.549,for housing but there is no housing a
1469.559,1471.75,lot of people were housed last year but
1471.76,1473.789,the rate of people that are becoming
1473.799,1475.83,homeless is greater than the rate that
1475.84,1477.75,they can house can't catch up yeah
1477.76,1479.35,meeting people on Skid Row is eye
1479.36,1480.909,openening and heart-wrenching hearing
1480.919,1482.63,their stories of struggle and survival
1482.64,1485.11,hits me hard I feel a mix of sadness and
1485.12,1486.99,determination knowing how much must be
1487.0,1488.95,done to help these people as I continue
1488.96,1490.83,to walk around I notice a blind man
1490.84,1492.87,approaching tapping his walking stick he
1492.88,1494.87,is kind enough to answer a few questions
1494.88,1497.149,what made you want to come to Skid Row I
1497.159,1499.31,don't have nobody to help me and I can't
1499.32,1502.71,hear CU there was help in SK do you like
1502.72,1505.11,the community here I don't like how the
1505.12,1507.43,the police manage over here and how the
1507.44,1509.669,city manage over here because the city
1509.679,1512.63,helps but doesn't manage what's the drug
1512.64,1513.95,problem like on

1518.12,1522.389,they there's alcohol there uh marijuana
1522.399,1525.07,it's uh it's a crystal cocaine it's
1525.08,1527.549,heroine as a blind man I imagine it's
1527.559,1528.909,more difficult to be here because
1528.919,1531.19,there's more danger yeah you see like
1531.2,1533.51,the city make a stupid thing to build

1629.52,1631.11,talking bro but for the most part I
1631.12,1633.19,would say this type of stuff coming down

1634.919,1636.11,they're actually going to use the things
1636.12,1637.47,that most people that we take for
1637.48,1639.909,granted socks and stuff take yeah yeah
1639.919,1641.549,down here shoes like the guy Russell

1688.559,1690.19,system it's not just about providing
1690.2,1692.029,shelter it's about addressing mental
1692.039,1694.23,health addiction and the systemic issues
1694.24,1696.19,that perpetuate homelessness we need to
1696.2,1697.59,implement policies that treat the
1697.6,1699.35,homeless with dignity and respect
1699.36,1701.07,Community involvement is crucial
1701.08,1703.47,volunteer donate advocate for Change and
