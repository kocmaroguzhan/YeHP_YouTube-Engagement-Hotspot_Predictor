5,10,to be
10,15,"okay . Hey , what 's going on everybody for First We Feast . I 'm Sean Evans and you 're watching Hot Ones . It 's the show with hot"
15,20,questions and even hotter wings . And today we 're joined by Dakota Johnson . She 's an actress and producer you know from films
20,25,"like Sesperia , Cha Cha , Real Smooth , The Lost Daughter , and many , many more . You can also catch her starring in the"
25,30,"latest A24 release , Materialist , a romantic comedy alongside Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal , releasing in"
30,35,"theaters on June 9th . Dakota Johnson , welcome to the show . Thanks . How are you around spicy"
35,40,food before we get started ? I 'm not I 'm not I 'm
40,45,not I 'm not going to be able to survive .
60,65,I do n't even really
65,70,"like chicken . I 'm scared . This one 's fine , right ? Yeah , no"
70,75,big deal . I wo n't cry yet . I do n't
75,80,think so .
80,85,I like that one .
85,90,Tasty .
90,95,"Did you learn anything interesting about the world of high - end matchmaking making this film ? You know , it must have"
95,100,"been really helpful , valuable to have the perspective of a director like Selene Song who had actual real"
100,105,"life experience in the business . Wow , you 're very good at this ."
105,110,"yes . Well , a lot of her stories were pretty"
110,115,wild and people really do speak probably more honestly to someone who 's
115,120,their matchmaker than even probably their therapist . The way that Seline
120,125,approached it was that it is like a business deal and Lucy 's like
125,130,trading and love . It 's really interesting . Very
130,135,opposite to how I think about things .
135,140,"They 're already on the wings . Yeah , we cut out the middleman for you , Dakota ."
140,145,Red carpet treatment . I would n't be able to do it . I would n't be able to
145,150,dress my own wing .
155,160,Just winging it .
160,165,That 's spicy . I 'm not going to do well . Okay . And I 'm not going to lie to
165,170,you either . That 's the trajectory that we 're on going forward . Okay .
170,175,Today Today is going to be my last day .
175,180,"Growing up on backlots and soundstages , what stands out as like your earliest core memories"
180,185,of being drawn in by the process of making films ? I
185,190,always felt like um I wanted to be a part like
190,195,when they when they 'd call rolling and everyone got really quiet and I would n't
195,200,see where my mom was or where my dad was and I was like watching the
200,205,monitors . I really wanted to be in the place where they were because it just felt like this magical
205,210,place . I also learned how to drive a golf cart when I was like six . That 's a big deal . And that
210,215,was fun to do on the on the lot
215,220,"on the stages . Oh , you 're giving me a look . Third wing"
220,225,"Yeah , I 'm a This is This is a pickled"
225,230,garlic Disgusting . Oh my
230,235,god . Pickled garlic . The
235,240,Why are some of them skinny and
240,245,"some of them are chunky ? You know , it 's like that in life , you"
245,250,That 's
250,255,life . That 's life . Summer skinny and summer . That 's how it
255,260,goes . How did the 1940s German expressionist
260,265,"dance that you trained for in Sesperia , how did that compare to like the ballet you 'd"
265,270,grown up with ? Um it did
270,275,n't did n't compare . It also was our the choreographer on
275,280,that movie um Damian Jalet . He counts in threes . So it 's one
280,285,and two and three and not an eight count and two and three and not an eight count which is normal . And it also was
285,290,like liberating because ballet is so much
290,295,about defying gravity . And the dance that
295,300,"we learned was about like really giving into it and looking quite , you"
300,305,"know , angular and like"
305,310,uh primal . We 're
310,315,"moving on again . If you 're ready . Only if you 're ready . Okay , let 's just do it . Let 's"
315,320,"just do it . So , up here is a mango srano hops . I"
320,325,like mango . That 's got to
325,330,count for something . Mhm .
330,335,"Seems like you 're struggling a bit . Yeah , I am . I 'm sharing with I 'm sharing in the experience with you and I 'm no superhero ,"
335,340,"you know . I feel it all the I am also not a superhero . Tried ,"
340,345,just
345,350,"like this show . So , I once heard I definitely do n't taste the"
350,355,"mango . Yeah , it 's uh the Serrano hops really kind of dominate . I agree with"
355,360,"you . Am I shaking ? No , you 're good . You 're good . Composed ,"
360,365,"graceful , more ballet , and expressionist dancing . So , I 've heard you"
365,370,"say that one of the things that compelled you to create your own production company , Tea Time , was this impulse to have"
370,375,more control over the final product . How does that shift your perspective as a
375,380,"creative ? Like , I imagine that there are a lot of stressors that you 'd have as a producer that are maybe not even on your"
380,385,radar as an actor . I
385,390,"know . My tongue burns . Um , I"
390,395,really prefer it . It 's hard to be on some jobs
395,400,"where I do n't have input , creative input . How often do you do Um ,"
400,405,"you know , sometimes up to three times a week . You know , we kind of off . I 'm not joking . I"
405,410,'m telling you the truth . Is your stomach okay ? The numbers keep coming back better . I 'm here to
410,415,report a clean bill of health . Yeah . I do n't know if that eases whatever tension you 're feeling coming
415,420,"into the studio today , but But your like"
420,425,gastrointestinal health is solid .
425,430,I 'm really upset . I do n't
430,435,want to eat And you know what ? You do n't have to . I appreciate that . I
435,440,"appreciate All right . If you 're ready to move on , this next one is called"
440,445,spicier sauerkraut and mustard .
445,450,Some
450,455,"of us are , you know . I once did a cameo opposite"
455,460,"Maya Rudolph and found that the hardest thing was not hitting my marks or saying my lines , but"
460,465,"it was to keep from breaking character from laughing . As someone who 's done their fair share of comedies ,"
465,470,have you ever had the experience of struggling to get through a scene simply because your co - star kept
470,475,"cracking you up ? Yes , even in not funny movies , I struggle to get through"
475,480,"scenes . Um , I find actually that even on the more serious"
480,485,"movies is when jokes are a foot . Oh , that 's interest ."
485,490,"That 's interesting . Like maybe if you 're doing like an intense psychological drama , maybe it 's like more"
490,495,"important that you 're laughing in between . Is that Yeah , definitely . Also ,"
495,500,"I mean , for for me at least , I think there 's actors probably that need to"
500,505,"maintain a certain mindset for the whole time , but I"
505,510,do n't do that . I 'm like a very
510,515,unserious person . Do you
515,520,"ever sit at home and be like , "" Oo , I 'd love to have some wings . "" It 's kind of like a telltale heart"
520,525,"that 's always in my life . You know , when I go to a restaurant , I do n't have to order wings for them to"
525,530,"like come out from the kitchen , you know , that sort of a thing . And then do you feel like you have to eat them ?"
530,535,"Yeah , I think I 'm like a nice like a nice Midwest guy , so I do feel like I have to at least try them ,"
535,540,you I know that sucks . It 's the It 's the
540,545,"crosseye bear . All right . So , up next , Tropical"
550,555,Tropical Amaro .
555,560,There used to be a Hot Wings restaurant around the
560,565,corner from my apartment when I was younger . Did you
565,570,"visit ? Yeah , I went there . Fond"
570,575,memories . I feel like I 'm doing pretty good . You are doing good . Am I ? But I knew that you
575,580,would with just the mindset that you walked in . My
580,585,mouth is on fire and it 's numb . But I would n't be able to tell . Calm and
585,590,"composed from the outside . Um , I did go to the Hot Wings"
590,595,Cafe . That 's what it was called . Hot Wings I like that they spell it out for you . Did
595,600,"you ever like were you a mild kind of order ? Uh , yeah . And also like"
600,605,loads of ranch dressing . You should give people ranch dressing . You know what ? We pay very close
605,610,"attention to the riders that come in . You know , like we have the gluten - free beer today . Like if somebody"
610,615,just threw in ranch . Let 's try that .
620,625,"So , up next is"
625,630,apricot . There you hit it . It 's the emphasis on
630,635,Apricot . Do you say apricot or apricot ? Apricot . I say
635,640,"apricot , I think . Is that weird ? No , but who 's right ? You know who 's"
640,645,Who 's right ? Maybe let 's switch . I 'll start saying apricot and you go with
645,650,"apricot . Okay , that was a big bite . Sean , are"
650,655,you okay ? Are you hungry ? They rip how
655,660,"they rip . You know , do you have a diagnosis as to why Hollywood is so"
660,665,"riskaverse ? You know , it 's a topic that 's discussed ad nauseium in industry media , but I 'm"
665,670,curious what you 've observed up close and personal . I think it 's
670,675,hard when creative decisions are made by and it 's hard when
675,680,creative decisions are made by people who do n't even really watch movies or like
680,685,know anything about them . And that tends to be what 's occurring a
685,690,lot . And I think also when something
690,695,does well um they like studios want to
695,700,keep that going . So they remake the same things and then but humans do n't
700,705,"want that . They want fresh . They want to feel new things , experience new things , see"
705,710,new So I do n't know . I guess it 's all
710,715,"just a bit of a mess right now , is n't it ?"
715,720,Chipotle puree orange juice .
720,725,What 's going on ?
725,730,"Oh ,"
730,735,Mm -
735,740,m. Mm - m.
740,745,I know . No .
745,750,"Sean , I know . No , I"
750,755,know . Uh - uh . The is that ? I do n't
755,760,"taste orange juice . I do n't like it . No , I know . And I understand ."
760,765,That 's the problem is it 's probably one of the spiciest things you 've ever eaten . And then on top of
765,770,"that , the taste of it , there 's no redeeming culinary qualities ."
770,775,Yeah . I ca n't . Oh my god . And then be careful around your eyes . Just do n't touch
775,780,"your eyes . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . No , I get it . Am I okay ? Yeah , you 're okay . You 're You 're"
780,785,going to be okay on the other side of this . I 'm not going to be okay . You 're going to be okay . I do n't want
785,790,anything . I need something .
790,795,Am I drooling ? No . You look great . You 're doing great . Do
795,800,n't lie to me . I 'm not lying to you . You 're
800,805,"doing great . I do n't like her . No , I"
805,810,understand . You do n't . You do n't
810,815,"understand . Do you want some ice cream ? Ice cream 's Mhm . Yeah , ice"
815,820,"cream coming in . I do n't want Okay , then . Be careful ."
820,825,Careful with the eyes . I have to go to the
825,830,hospital . No . Is this real ice cream ? Yeah . We
830,835,'re not . The stunts are over . All right . The gags are over . The pranks are over . I
835,840,promise . What are the furthest ls you 've gone to in order to get your hands on a piece of
840,845,"vintage furniture ? You know , you do hunt like the throwback fixtures . I bought something in Italy"
845,850,once and it took like 6 months to get to
850,855,America . What was that piece ? It was
855,860,like a dumb credenza .
860,865,Worth the wait ? Do you still have it ? I have it . Yeah .
865,870,Not worth the wait .
870,875,I 'm going to vomit . I do n't like this at
875,880,"all . Sean , I 'm I get it . I get it . I wo"
880,885,n't be back . And I do n't take that personal . I do n't take that
885,890,personal . Does anybody do it multiple times ? No . Some people have come back . off . Really ? Who ? Who ?
890,895,Gordon Ramsay came back . Will Frell came I was
895,900,once on a talk show with Gordon I was on James
900,905,Cordon . We were sitting on the couch together and I realized afterwards that if
905,910,"they got married , his name would be Gordon"
910,915,Cordon . And I was so annoyed that I did n't think of that on
915,920,"the show . Well , I 'm happy that we could offer the platform for you to get it off now . You"
920,925,thank you . This was n't worth it . I told James
925,930,"that joke and he was like , "" You 're an"
930,935,"idiot . """
935,940,It 's
940,945,"the tiniest bite . Look , it counts ."
945,950,Right . But think about that . You just shook that
950,955,off . The last one . This does n't It 's not I do n't like the
955,960,If you eat an one of
960,965,"the ones on the other side , does it like mitigate the spice or it"
965,970,"adds more spice ? You know , that 's interesting . I 've done the show for a long time and I"
970,975,"think you 're the first person to pose that , you know , so now I 'm thinking it"
975,980,through in real time . Yeah . Like what if you eat something spicy ? If you eat something less
980,985,spicy as that kind of like a ginger palette cleanser in the world of a spicy wing
985,990,gauntlet . Yeah . I 'll lab rat this for you . Okay . That was a big
990,995,bite . That 's all I know . Which one did you pick ? The first one ? I picked the very first
995,1000,one . Does it feel better ? You know what ? That 's not nothing .
1000,1005,Yeah . Wow . I 'm a genius .
1005,1010,Is there a practical skill that you 've learned through preparing for a role that 's been most
1010,1015,transferable or valuable in your everyday life ? Stunt driving is fun .
1015,1020,Definitely . And hard to kind of let go of that . Yeah .
1020,1025,"Like if you 're preparing for like a roll in Need for Speed , like does that make you like a better parallel parker on"
1025,1030,the other side of it ? Oh my god . I can do like
1030,1035,"a highspeed 180 . I 'm really good at parallel parking , too . I"
1035,1040,'m like a one and done . Yeah . And look at you running this
1040,1045,gauntlet over here . Are you going to put more sauce on your wink ? Do I have to do that ? Is
1045,1050,that part of the game ?
1050,1055,I do n't want to be a
1055,1060,little I do n't want I do n't want to . You do n't have to . I 'm going to . It 's a
1060,1065,Little tiny
1065,1070,dab . There we go . Okay .
1070,1075,"And with that , Dakota"
1075,1080,"Johnson , you 've conquered the wings of death . And just one more question before we get you out of here . I 've"
1080,1085,heard you talk about being nostalgic for an era of movies that inspired
1085,1090,"hope . Maybe this is an ironic time to ask , but what do you see as"
1090,1095,the enduring appeal of a happy ending in a Because I
1095,1100,think people want that for themselves ultimately . It 's
1100,1105,happiness and happy ending . And you know what ? Not the
1105,1110,sexual kind . But look at you today putting a bow on this
1110,1115,episode here . I would describe this as a happy ending before we roll the credits . And now there 's nothing
