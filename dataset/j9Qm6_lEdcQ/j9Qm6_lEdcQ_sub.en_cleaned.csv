0.24,2.149,"Am I okay? Yeah, you're okay. You're"
2.159,3.669,going to be You're going to be okay on
3.6790000000000003,5.03,the other side of this. I'm not going to
5.04,10.15,be okay.
10.16,11.589,"Hey, what's going on everybody for First"
11.599,13.11,We Feast. I'm Sean Evans and you're
13.12,14.549,watching Hot Ones. It's the show with
14.559,16.31,hot questions and even hotter wings. And
16.32,18.15,today we're joined by Dakota Johnson.
18.16,19.429,She's an actress and producer you know
19.439,21.189,"from films like Sesperia, Cha Cha, Real"
21.199,22.55,"Smooth, The Lost Daughter, and many,"
22.56,23.99,many more. You can also catch her
24.0,25.83,"starring in the latest A24 release,"
25.84,27.83,"Materialist, a romantic comedy alongside"
27.84,29.83,"Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal, releasing"
29.84,31.99,"in theaters on June 9th. Dakota Johnson,"
32.0,34.229,welcome to the show. Thanks. How are you
34.239,36.15,around spicy food before we get started?
36.16,40.15,I'm not I'm not I'm not
40.16,44.68,I'm not going to be able to survive.
62.48,66.31,I don't even really like chicken.
66.32,69.19,"I'm scared. This one's fine, right?"
69.2,72.23,"Yeah, no big deal. I won't cry yet. I"
72.24,77.91,don't think so.
82.159,85.18,I like that one. Tasty.
90.32,91.99,Did you learn anything interesting about
92.0,93.91,the world of high-end matchmaking making
93.92,95.109,"this film? You know, it must have been"
95.119,96.87,"really helpful, valuable to have the"
96.88,98.71,perspective of a director like Selene
98.72,100.789,Song who had actual real life experience
100.799,102.63,"in the business. Wow, you're very good"
102.64,104.39,at this.
106.56,109.27,"yes. Well, a lot of her stories were"
109.28,112.71,pretty wild and people really do speak
112.72,114.789,probably more honestly to someone who's
114.799,116.789,their matchmaker than even probably
116.799,119.59,their therapist. The way that Seline
119.6,121.749,approached it was that it is like a
121.759,125.27,business deal and Lucy's like trading
125.28,128.229,and love. It's really interesting. Very
128.239,135.51,opposite to how I think about things.
135.52,137.83,"They're already on the wings. Yeah, we"
137.84,139.83,"cut out the middleman for you, Dakota."
139.84,141.43,Red carpet treatment. I wouldn't
141.44,143.67,be able to do it. I wouldn't be able to
143.68,147.43,dress my own wing.
154.72,158.47,Just winging it.
160.8,163.43,That's spicy. I'm not going to do well.
163.44,165.11,Okay. And I'm not going to lie to you
165.12,166.63,either. That's the trajectory that we're
166.64,169.75,on going forward. Okay.
169.76,174.55,Today Today is going to be my last day.
174.56,177.27,"Growing up on backlots and soundstages,"
177.28,179.11,what stands out as like your earliest
179.12,181.35,core memories of being drawn in by the
181.36,183.75,process of making films?
183.76,186.79,I always felt like
186.8,190.63,um I wanted to be a part like when they
190.64,192.309,when they'd call rolling and everyone
192.319,195.11,got really quiet and I wouldn't see
195.12,197.35,where my mom was or where my dad was and
197.36,200.39,I was like watching the monitors. I
200.4,202.309,really wanted to be in the place where
202.319,204.07,they were because it just felt like this
204.08,206.39,magical place. I also learned how to
206.4,208.55,drive a golf cart when I was like six.
208.56,210.39,That's a big deal. And that was fun to
210.4,217.83,do on the on the lot on the stages.
217.84,219.91,"Oh, you're giving me a look. Third wing"
219.92,222.949,"Yeah, I'm a This is"
222.959,225.509,This is a pickled garlic
225.519,228.71,Disgusting.
228.72,235.67,Oh my god. Pickled garlic. The
238.64,240.309,Why are some of them skinny and some of
240.319,242.63,them are chunky?
242.64,244.949,"You know, it's like that in life, you"
249.28,251.75,That's life. That's life. Summer skinny
251.76,255.589,and summer. That's how it goes.
257.199,259.909,How did the 1940s German expressionist
259.919,261.749,"dance that you trained for in Sesperia,"
261.759,263.51,how did that compare to like the ballet
263.52,267.35,you'd grown up with?
267.36,270.39,Um it didn't
270.4,273.35,didn't compare. It also was our the
273.36,276.55,choreographer on that movie um Damian
276.56,279.99,Jalet. He counts in threes. So it's one
280.0,282.39,and two and three and not an eight count
282.4,285.11,which is normal. And it also was like
286.72,289.59,liberating because ballet is so much
289.6,292.39,about defying gravity.
292.4,296.31,And the dance that we learned
296.32,297.99,was about like really giving into it and
298.0,301.27,"looking quite, you know, angular and"
301.28,309.35,like uh primal.
309.36,311.99,We're moving on again. If you're ready.
312.0,313.59,Only if you're ready.
313.6,315.27,"Okay, let's just do it. Let's just do"
315.28,318.95,"it. So, up here is a mango srano hops. I"
318.96,321.59,like mango.
321.6,329.749,That's got to count for something. Mhm.
329.759,331.35,Seems like you're struggling a bit.
331.36,333.029,"Yeah, I am. I'm sharing with I'm sharing"
333.039,334.469,in the experience with you and I'm no
334.479,336.15,"superhero, you know. I feel it all the"
336.16,339.51,"I am also not a superhero. Tried,"
343.28,346.95,just like this show.
346.96,348.95,"So, I once heard I definitely don't"
348.96,352.07,"taste the mango. Yeah, it's uh the"
352.08,354.07,Serrano hops really kind of dominate. I
354.08,356.55,"agree with you. Am I shaking? No, you're"
356.56,360.07,"good. You're good. Composed, graceful,"
360.08,364.23,"more ballet, and expressionist dancing."
364.24,365.749,"So, I've heard you say that one of the"
365.759,367.189,things that compelled you to create your
367.199,368.95,"own production company, Tea Time, was"
368.96,370.71,this impulse to have more control over
370.72,373.35,the final product. How does that shift
373.36,375.35,"your perspective as a creative? Like, I"
375.36,376.87,imagine that there are a lot of
376.88,378.469,stressors that you'd have as a producer
378.479,380.15,that are maybe not even on your radar as
380.16,383.11,an actor.
383.12,385.59,I know.
385.6,388.469,My tongue burns.
388.479,393.43,"Um, I really prefer it. It's hard to be"
393.44,397.029,"on some jobs where I don't have input,"
397.039,399.51,creative input. How often do you do
399.52,401.83,"Um, you know, sometimes up to"
401.84,403.59,"three times a week. You know, we kind of"
403.6,405.59,off. I'm not joking. I'm telling
405.6,407.909,you the truth. Is your stomach okay? The
407.919,409.35,numbers keep coming back better. I'm
409.36,411.27,here to report a clean bill of health.
411.28,413.27,Yeah. I don't know if that eases
413.28,414.71,whatever tension you're feeling coming
414.72,418.629,"into the studio today, but But your like"
418.639,426.87,gastrointestinal health is solid.
426.88,430.87,I'm really upset. I don't want to eat
430.88,433.27,And you know what? You don't have
433.28,435.67,to. I appreciate that. I appreciate
435.68,437.83,All right. If you're ready to move
437.84,440.55,"on, this next one is called spicier"
440.56,444.23,sauerkraut and mustard.
448.88,453.11,"Some of us are, you know."
453.12,455.749,I once did a cameo opposite Maya Rudolph
455.759,457.51,and found that the hardest thing was not
457.52,459.909,"hitting my marks or saying my lines, but"
459.919,461.909,it was to keep from breaking character
461.919,463.749,from laughing. As someone who's done
463.759,465.27,"their fair share of comedies, have you"
465.28,467.029,ever had the experience of struggling to
467.039,468.71,get through a scene simply because your
468.72,471.35,"co-star kept cracking you up? Yes, even"
471.36,473.27,"in not funny movies, I struggle to get"
473.28,475.189,through scenes.
475.199,477.589,"Um, I find actually that even on the"
477.599,480.869,more serious movies is when
480.879,484.869,"jokes are a foot. Oh, that's interest."
484.879,486.469,That's interesting. Like maybe if you're
486.479,487.99,doing like an intense psychological
488.0,490.469,"drama, maybe it's like more important"
490.479,492.629,that you're laughing in between. Is that
492.639,495.51,"Yeah, definitely. Also, I mean,"
495.52,497.11,"for for me at least, I think there's"
497.12,500.469,actors probably that need to maintain a
500.479,504.79,"certain mindset for the whole time, but"
504.8,507.67,I don't do that. I'm like a very
507.68,514.709,unserious person.
514.719,516.07,"Do you ever sit at home and be like,"
516.08,518.31,"""Oo, I'd love to have some wings."" It's"
518.32,520.23,kind of like a telltale heart that's
520.24,521.99,"always in my life. You know, when I go"
522.0,523.909,"to a restaurant, I don't have to order"
523.919,525.91,wings for them to like come out from the
525.92,528.389,"kitchen, you know, that sort of a thing."
528.399,529.509,And then do you feel like you have to
529.519,531.509,"eat them? Yeah, I think I'm like a nice"
531.519,533.35,"like a nice Midwest guy, so I do feel"
533.36,535.19,"like I have to at least try them, you"
535.2,537.99,I know that sucks. It's the
538.0,540.63,It's the crosseye bear.
540.64,543.269,"All right. So, up next, Tropical"
545.279,556.23,Tropical Amaro.
556.24,559.269,There used to be a Hot Wings restaurant
559.279,561.829,around the corner from my apartment when
561.839,565.829,"I was younger. Did you visit? Yeah, I"
565.839,570.23,went there. Fond memories.
570.24,572.71,I feel like I'm doing pretty good. You
572.72,574.79,are doing good. Am I? But I knew that
574.8,576.47,you would with just the mindset that you
576.48,579.269,walked in.
579.279,582.55,My mouth is on fire and it's numb. But I
582.56,584.87,wouldn't be able to tell. Calm and
584.88,587.509,composed from the outside.
587.519,590.15,"Um, I did go to the Hot Wings Cafe."
590.16,591.35,That's what it was called. Hot Wings
593.04,594.71,I like that they spell it out for you.
594.72,597.11,Did you ever like were you a mild kind
597.12,600.389,"of order? Uh, yeah. And also like loads"
600.399,602.23,of ranch dressing. You should give
602.24,604.07,people ranch dressing. You know what? We
604.08,605.99,pay very close attention to the riders
606.0,607.75,"that come in. You know, like we have the"
607.76,609.67,gluten-free beer today. Like if somebody
609.68,612.79,just threw in ranch. Let's try that.
623.04,626.15,"So, up next is apricot."
626.16,628.71,There you hit it. It's the emphasis on
628.72,631.509,Apricot.
631.519,634.55,Do you say apricot or apricot? Apricot.
634.56,637.03,"I say apricot, I think. Is that weird?"
637.04,639.67,"No, but who's right? You know who's"
639.68,642.47,Who's right? Maybe let's switch.
642.48,643.99,I'll start saying apricot and you go
644.0,647.59,"with apricot. Okay,"
647.6,650.71,"that was a big bite. Sean, are you okay?"
650.72,653.269,Are you hungry?
653.279,657.269,"They rip how they rip. You know,"
657.279,659.03,do you have a diagnosis as to why
659.04,660.79,"Hollywood is so riskaverse? You know,"
660.8,662.55,it's a topic that's discussed ad
662.56,664.79,"nauseium in industry media, but I'm"
664.8,666.389,curious what you've observed up close
666.399,671.11,and personal. I think it's hard when
671.12,672.47,creative decisions are made by
672.48,675.99,and it's hard when creative
676.0,677.829,decisions are made by people who don't
677.839,680.23,even really watch movies or like know
680.24,682.23,anything about them.
682.24,684.79,And that tends to be what's occurring a
684.8,687.67,lot. And I think also
687.68,691.03,when something does well
691.04,696.23,um they like studios want to keep that
696.24,698.069,going. So they remake the same things
698.079,700.55,and then but humans don't want that.
700.56,703.43,They want fresh. They want to feel new
703.44,705.03,"things, experience new things, see new"
706.72,710.15,So I don't know. I guess it's all just a
710.16,714.14,"bit of a mess right now, isn't it?"
717.279,720.31,Chipotle puree orange juice. What's
720.32,722.389,going on?
722.399,733.91,"Oh,"
733.92,736.68,Mm-m. Mm-m.
742.24,745.91,"I know. No. Sean,"
745.92,751.43,"I know. No, I know. Uh-uh."
751.44,754.069,The is that?
754.079,757.11,I don't taste orange juice.
757.12,759.269,"I don't like it. No, I know. And I"
759.279,761.19,understand. That's the problem is it's
761.2,762.47,probably one of the spiciest things
762.48,764.71,you've ever eaten. And then on top of
764.72,767.59,"that, the taste of it,"
767.6,769.43,there's no redeeming culinary qualities.
769.44,773.19,Yeah. I can't. Oh my god. And then be
773.2,774.23,careful around your eyes. Just don't
774.24,777.03,touch your eyes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
777.04,778.79,"No, I get it. Am I okay? Yeah, you're"
778.8,780.949,okay. You're You're going to be okay on
780.959,782.23,the other side of this. I'm not going to
782.24,784.069,be okay. You're going to be okay. I
784.079,786.949,don't want anything. I need something.
791.04,793.509,Am I drooling? No. You look great.
793.519,796.069,You're doing great. Don't lie to me. I'm
796.079,801.11,not lying to you. You're doing great.
801.12,803.35,I don't like her.
803.36,807.59,"No, I understand. You don't."
807.6,810.15,You don't understand.
810.16,811.67,Do you want some ice cream? Ice cream's
811.68,818.47,"Mhm. Yeah, ice cream coming in."
818.48,819.67,"I don't want Okay, then. Be careful."
819.68,821.91,Careful with the eyes.
821.92,826.949,I have to go to the hospital. No.
826.959,829.269,Is this real ice cream? Yeah.
829.279,831.19,We're not.
831.2,833.19,The stunts are over. All right. The gags
833.2,834.55,are over. The pranks are over. I
834.56,837.269,promise. What are the furthest ls you've
837.279,839.35,gone to in order to get your hands on a
839.36,840.87,"piece of vintage furniture? You know,"
840.88,843.67,you do hunt like the throwback fixtures.
843.68,845.35,I bought something in Italy once and it
845.36,850.23,took like 6 months to get to America.
850.24,852.79,What was that piece?
852.8,860.629,It was like a dumb credenza.
860.639,862.47,Worth the wait? Do you still have it? I
862.48,867.58,have it. Yeah. Not worth the wait.
870.24,873.59,I'm going to vomit.
873.6,875.75,"I don't like this at all. Sean, I'm"
875.76,879.189,I get it. I get it.
879.199,881.91,I won't be back.
881.92,884.23,And I don't take that personal. I don't
884.24,885.99,take that personal. Does anybody do it
886.0,887.509,multiple times? No. Some people have
887.519,889.509,come back. off. Really? Who? Who?
889.519,892.23,Gordon Ramsay came back. Will Frell came
894.639,897.11,I was once on a talk show with Gordon
898.639,901.43,I was on James Cordon. We were sitting
901.44,903.43,on the couch together and I realized
903.44,906.23,"afterwards that if they got married, his"
906.24,910.79,name would be Gordon Cordon.
910.8,912.71,And I was so annoyed that I didn't think
912.72,915.91,of that on the show.
915.92,917.59,"Well, I'm happy that we could offer the"
917.6,919.59,platform for you to get it off now. You
919.6,924.15,thank you. This wasn't worth it.
924.16,926.31,"I told James that joke and he was like,"
926.32,931.06,"""You're an idiot."""
939.279,944.06,"It's the tiniest bite. Look, it counts."
945.76,947.43,Right. But think about that. You just
947.44,952.23,shook that off. The last one.
952.24,954.15,This doesn't It's not I don't like the
957.44,960.949,If you eat an one of the ones
960.959,963.269,"on the other side, does it like mitigate"
963.279,966.389,the spice or it adds more spice? You
966.399,968.389,"know, that's interesting. I've done the"
968.399,970.47,show for a long time and I think you're
970.48,973.35,"the first person to pose that, you know,"
973.36,975.43,so now I'm thinking it through in real
975.44,977.829,time. Yeah. Like what if you eat
977.839,979.509,something spicy? If you eat something
979.519,981.91,less spicy as that kind of like a ginger
981.92,984.389,palette cleanser in the world of a spicy
984.399,986.87,wing gauntlet. Yeah. I'll lab rat this
986.88,988.79,for you. Okay.
988.8,991.35,That was a big bite. That's all I know.
991.36,992.79,Which one did you pick? The first one? I
992.8,995.03,picked the very first one.
995.04,997.829,Does it feel better?
997.839,999.269,You know what? That's not nothing.
999.279,1005.43,Yeah. Wow. I'm a genius.
1005.44,1007.509,Is there a practical skill that you've
1007.519,1008.79,learned through preparing for a role
1008.8,1010.629,that's been most transferable or
1010.639,1013.43,valuable in your everyday life? Stunt
1013.44,1016.23,driving is fun. Definitely.
1016.24,1019.829,And hard to kind of let go of that.
1019.839,1021.03,Yeah. Like if you're preparing for like
1021.04,1022.629,"a roll in Need for Speed, like does that"
1022.639,1024.63,make you like a better parallel parker
1024.64,1028.549,on the other side of it? Oh my god.
1028.559,1031.429,I can do like a highspeed
1031.439,1033.429,180. I'm really good at parallel
1033.439,1037.27,"parking, too. I'm like a one and done."
1037.28,1039.909,Yeah. And look at you running this
1039.919,1041.59,gauntlet over here. Are you going to put
1041.6,1043.909,more sauce on your wink? Do I have to do
1043.919,1047.53,that? Is that part of the game?
1051.6,1055.27,I don't want to be a little
1055.28,1058.23,I don't want I don't want to. You don't
1058.24,1059.669,have to. I'm going to. It's a
1062.96,1065.35,Little tiny dab.
1065.36,1069.24,There we go. Okay.
1072.559,1075.83,"And with that, Dakota Johnson, you've"
1075.84,1077.59,conquered the wings of death. And just
1077.6,1079.19,one more question before we get you out
1079.2,1081.59,of here. I've heard you talk about being
1081.6,1083.99,nostalgic for an era of movies that
1084.0,1087.11,inspired hope. Maybe this is an ironic
1087.12,1090.07,"time to ask, but what do you see as the"
1090.08,1092.71,enduring appeal of a happy ending in a
1094.32,1096.63,Because I think people want that for
1096.64,1098.87,themselves ultimately.
1098.88,1101.99,It's happiness and happy ending. And you
1102.0,1106.31,know what? Not the sexual kind.
1106.32,1109.27,But look at you today putting a bow on

1111.52,1113.43,as a happy ending before we roll the
1113.44,1115.11,credits. And now there's nothing left to
1115.12,1116.87,"do but roll out the red carpet for you,"
1116.88,1118.789,"Dakota Johnson. This camera, this"
1118.799,1120.15,"camera, this camera. Let the people know"
