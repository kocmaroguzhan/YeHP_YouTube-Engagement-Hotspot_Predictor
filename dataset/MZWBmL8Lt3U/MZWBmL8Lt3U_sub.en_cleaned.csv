0.32,1.869,We're going to go for
1.879,8.43,it. Yeah. All
8.44,11.749,"right. This is the new electric G Wagon,"
11.759,13.749,but they're still calling it a G Wagon.
13.759,16.67,And it is very much a G
16.68,19.429,Wagon. And the best way to know that
19.439,21.75,you're dealing with a G Wagon is right
21.76,23.509,here. Let's just get this out of the way
27.24,29.91,away. It's like a vault. You know what?
29.92,31.349,It's not even just when you open and
31.359,32.87,close the doors. It's also when you lock
32.88,35.95,them. Listen to
35.96,39.47,this. Are you kidding? Listen.
39.48,43.43,Unlock. It is just so mechanical in that
43.44,44.95,regard and you're not used to it with
44.96,47.27,electric vehicles. This is a special
47.28,49.35,like addition one. It has a few
49.36,51.27,different elements associated with that.
51.28,53.59,It is quite an expensive option package.
53.6,55.43,"And the paint itself, at least in terms"
55.44,57.189,"of Canadian dollars, is like 8,000"
57.199,59.11,"bucks. But it's a G Wagon, ladies and"
59.12,61.27,"gentlemen, and you expect to pay for"
61.28,64.789,"this level of premium. For me, this"
64.799,67.03,"doesn't feel like, hey, I'm an electric"
67.04,68.789,"vehicle. I mean, in this case, maybe the"
68.799,70.39,blue coloring kind of gives it away a
70.4,71.83,little bit. That's an unusual color for
71.84,74.87,"a G Wagon, but they've really retained"
74.88,76.95,"tradition, which is what I think people"
76.96,79.35,wanted them to do with the G Wagon if it
79.36,81.99,"were to go electric. So, you're still"
82.0,84.55,getting that whole origin and history
84.56,87.91,"and ruggedness and boxiness, which is"
87.92,90.07,rare for electric vehicles. You'd be
90.08,91.67,"hardressed to say, ""Hey, that's the"
91.68,93.27,"electric one."" Because they're still"
93.28,95.27,selling one that looks almost identical
95.28,97.83,to this that's gasoline powered. There's
97.84,99.67,a few giveaways that this is electric
99.68,101.27,"from the outside, but like I said, you"
101.28,102.71,have to know what you're looking for.
102.72,105.109,"So, this little EQ badge is probably the"
105.119,107.19,"most obvious component, which says"
107.2,109.19,electric. There's also this little blue
109.2,112.149,"strip that travels down the side, which"
112.159,114.23,also indicates that this is the electric
114.24,115.99,"model. But if you look at the back, it"
116.0,118.23,still says G580 on it. The little
118.24,120.789,backpack is one more giveaway. So rather
120.799,123.59,"than have a spare tire here, if I unlock"
123.6,126.069,"the car, now I can open the backpack."
126.079,127.91,"Currently, they've just got the charge"
127.92,130.15,cable in here. I guess you could fit a
130.16,132.15,few other items. And it's nice that it
132.16,134.39,"locks when the car locks, but it is"
134.4,137.19,fairly narrow. the door to the rear gets
137.2,138.949,"lighter weight, so you don't have to"
138.959,140.63,work so hard to slam it. It still sounds
140.64,142.229,awesome. And the other thing is you can
142.239,143.229,kind of hear
143.239,146.07,that that sound that it makes. That's
146.08,148.15,"another giveaway, I suppose. But the G"
148.16,150.39,"Wagon as a whole, not just the electric"
150.4,153.11,"model for 2025, has a lot of modern"
153.12,155.509,"upgrades. Adaptive cruise control, stay"
155.519,157.83,"in its lane, the infotainment system."
157.84,160.07,"Obviously, this one has EQ specific"
160.08,161.91,features on it. Other things that are
161.92,164.39,"kind of specific to this edition, one"
164.4,166.71,steps on the side. certain black and
166.72,168.71,chrome elements. The grill is something
168.72,170.15,that I wanted to talk about as well
170.16,171.99,because some of the early videos I saw
172.0,173.99,"in the electric G Wagon, they had this"
174.0,177.27,really modern looking electrified grill
177.28,178.949,which wasn't really a grill. It was more
178.959,180.869,like a cap on the front. I didn't like
180.879,182.63,"the look of it because again, it's like"
182.64,184.309,it's a G Wagon. Let's just keep looking
184.319,186.149,like a G Wagon. So what if it's not the
186.159,187.91,most efficient electric vehicle in the
187.92,189.509,"world? People who buy these things, they"
189.519,191.589,want them to look sort of like military
191.599,193.67,"vehicles. So, I prefer this traditional"
193.68,195.67,"grill, even if it's an electric vehicle"
195.68,197.43,that has no use for it. The other thing
197.44,199.83,that that kind of cap grill does is it
199.84,201.83,brings a two-tone black over this
201.84,204.07,portion that surrounds the headlights. I
204.08,205.43,just didn't like the look of it very
205.44,206.79,"much, but I did see it in some of the"
206.8,208.229,"earlier videos. It is an option. So,"
208.239,210.55,"it's like 1,600 bucks if you put that"
210.56,214.149,more futuristic black glossy finish on
214.159,215.589,the front rather than the traditional
215.599,217.35,"grill. So, I would say don't even bother"
217.36,218.789,doing that. And I think that this
218.799,220.63,addition one is actually a pretty good
220.64,222.55,and nice looking setup. It also gives
222.56,224.149,"you these wheels, so you get the black"
224.159,225.589,"wheels instead, which look better. And"
225.599,227.03,"if you look closely, you can see the"
227.04,229.11,"brake calipers in that blue color, which"
229.12,231.75,matches the tone of the paint. The
231.76,233.83,"mirrors, they fold in. I think these"
233.84,235.83,tints came from the factory as well. To
235.84,237.75,"charge it up, it's on the right hand"
237.76,239.91,side. You press here. There we go. It
239.92,241.91,"flies open. So, it is assisted. And then"
241.92,243.75,"it is locking. So, you press this button"
243.76,245.509,here in order to unlock that charge
245.519,247.509,port. Just remember to close it. No
247.519,250.149,fancy motorized like sliding door like
250.159,252.229,the Tyan. It's just you just press the
252.239,255.11,"button, it flings open, plug in and"
255.12,257.43,charge and uh get going with your G
257.44,258.789,Wagon. And this is another thing for
258.799,261.189,2025. We can now approach the vehicle
261.199,262.95,and have it just unlock with the key in
262.96,264.23,our pocket. We don't need to actually
264.24,265.99,initiate it. And actually before I get
266.0,267.59,"inside, I want to mention one more thing"
267.6,269.189,that kind of coincides with that. The
269.199,271.749,"little G area on the button itself,"
271.759,274.31,mechanical button. So now if I were to
274.32,276.95,"approach the vehicle, it would initially"
276.96,279.11,unlock and then I would press the button
279.12,281.03,and open the door. And I just noticed we
281.04,282.909,got a pretty cool badge here.
282.919,285.03,"MercedesBenz, how do I even say that"
285.04,287.67,word? Shockle approved. It sounds tough.
287.68,289.59,"Sounds rugged. Anyway, we'll talk more"
289.6,291.35,"about the interior in a moment, but like"
291.36,293.51,this latch. This is the latch that we
293.52,295.749,all love. Look at how robust this latch
295.759,299.629,is. Listen to
299.639,302.95,"that. Damn, dude. You just feel every"
302.96,304.629,day. Imagine every day you get in the
304.639,308.79,"car just bam. Uh, it's funny cuz it's a"
308.8,310.71,Segway and I'm looking for a Segway.
310.72,313.27,Thank you to Segue for sponsoring this
313.28,315.749,video and bringing us their brand new
315.759,318.55,Ninebot Max G3. A lot of people have
318.56,319.83,been saying positive things about this
319.84,321.029,thing. I watched a bunch of videos
321.039,322.95,before they sent it over. It is just a
322.96,324.87,complete package and I think they're
324.88,326.55,having promotions. Check the
326.56,328.79,description. But this thing has a big
328.8,332.71,"range. very smooth, a maximum of 80 km"
332.72,335.67,or 50 mi. It has good speed with a
335.68,338.31,"maximum of 45 km an hour, which is 28"
338.32,341.67,mph. It can drive up inclines up to 30%.
341.68,343.43,You have suspension on your front end
343.44,346.07,and also on the rear as well. You got
346.08,348.87,this new improved display which is going
348.88,350.55,to show you your range. You got a sport
350.56,352.07,mode for speed. You've got a walk mode
352.08,354.15,if you want to walk beside. The entire
354.16,356.23,thing folds down into a small package so
356.24,357.749,you can put it in the back of a car.
357.759,359.67,Just a threeprong to charge it up. And
359.68,361.59,this also has a gasket for weather
361.6,364.23,"resistance. Big beefy grips, comfortable"
364.24,366.309,"brake locations, and then lighting. We"
366.319,368.309,have signals on either side. Bright
368.319,370.55,headlight. This straight line coming
370.56,372.67,behind them. You've even got a little
372.68,374.87,"bell. So, we've actually got pretty wide"
374.88,377.35,tires on here. These are 11 in. And they
377.36,378.79,don't really tell you to go off-road.
378.8,380.07,This is not their off-road centric
380.08,382.79,"model, but these have some selfsealing"
382.8,384.469,attributes. It makes them a little bit
384.479,386.23,tougher to puncture. It's also got
386.24,387.35,something called air lock. When you
387.36,389.11,approach it with your app in your
389.12,390.95,"pocket, it'll unlock. And they've also"
390.96,393.189,integrated with Apple Find My. So if
393.199,395.83,"your Max G3 happens to go missing, you"
395.84,397.749,"can track it down. Damn, dude. You just"
397.759,399.83,feel every day. Imagine every day you
399.84,402.309,"get in the car, just bam. Don't get your"
402.319,404.15,"finger stuck in there, right, Will?"
404.16,406.629,Okay. To the rear. Really big opening.
406.639,408.15,Quite a bit of cargo space. They say
408.16,409.99,that the electric variant has I think
410.0,413.029,"they said like 3 cubic feet less cargo,"
413.039,414.23,but essentially what you're looking at
414.24,415.83,here is cargo space that's similar to
415.84,417.749,the standard G Wagon. You have some tie
417.759,420.07,down areas here. We have a cargo cover
420.08,421.67,which we can pull back. We can also
421.68,423.35,"remove it if we choose to, which is what"
423.36,425.029,"I normally do with these things. So, I"
425.039,427.27,can get even more cargo volume and I'm
427.28,429.27,always putting hockey sticks and sports
429.28,431.029,"equipment into my vehicle. So, these"
431.039,432.469,things tend to get in the way. We've
432.479,434.39,also got a 12vt on the side. This is
434.4,435.67,going to be good for your portable
435.68,437.189,fridge that you might want to keep in
437.199,438.55,"the back here. That would be good. Now,"
438.56,440.79,there is an interesting way in which the
440.8,443.67,seats fold. It's a two-step situation.
443.68,446.629,"First, what we do is we pull the seat"
446.639,448.23,itself. There's a little handle for
448.24,450.39,"that. So, this portion goes up first,"
450.4,451.43,and then you're going to have to have
451.44,453.83,this headrest in the down position
453.84,455.51,"because what happens next, you click"
455.52,457.589,"this lever, and then this comes down and"
457.599,459.27,"fits in there. So, it's a two-step"
459.28,461.11,situation. The same is the case for the
461.12,463.589,"other side. So, you've got this 60/40"
463.599,465.749,"split situation. Now, the only thing I"
465.759,468.23,noticed with this setup is that if these
468.24,470.55,"seats are too far back, see what I mean?"
470.56,472.309,"It'll go, but it just kind of bumps into"
472.319,473.99,it if these seats are too far back. If
474.0,475.83,"this seats up a little further, it makes"
475.84,478.629,it a lot easier. It also has a couple
478.639,481.51,different spots that it can be stopped
481.52,483.189,in. I don't know anybody that would want
483.199,484.79,"to sit there like this, but maybe if you"
484.8,486.629,"need extra cargo in the back, that could"
486.639,488.39,be useful. There is also a pass through
488.4,489.83,if you want to just put a long item
489.84,491.909,through the center. the seats down. You
491.919,493.67,go with the pass through instead if you
493.68,495.35,want to put skis or I guess I could have
495.36,496.95,put a hockey stick like that too. I
496.96,498.23,should talk about trim while we're back
498.24,499.909,here. We get this carbon fiber. This is
499.919,501.749,our first glance at the carbon fiber
501.759,502.629,we're going to see throughout the
502.639,504.39,vehicle. And they found a way to get a
504.4,506.309,little bit of blue in there. Very
506.319,507.83,"subtle, but it is in there. And that"
507.84,509.35,same blue stitching here on this big
509.36,510.469,panel. And you're going to see it
510.479,511.589,throughout the vehicle in different
511.599,513.35,spots as well. There's also puddle
513.36,514.87,"projectors. And actually, you can get"
514.88,516.709,them configured a couple different ways.
516.719,519.029,One of them says stronger than time.
519.039,520.31,That's what the addition one says. It
520.32,522.31,says stronger than time. It has a big G.
522.32,524.149,You can also just get a Mercedes emblem
524.159,525.829,if you prefer. And then there's no frunk
525.839,527.35,because there's all kinds of tech in
527.36,529.03,"here, including a really large battery."
529.04,531.75,I think it's 116 kWh underneath. They
531.76,533.67,did actually because this thing is meant
533.68,535.829,to off-road. They put extra protection
535.839,538.23,"in the battery area. So, the entire"
538.24,540.949,undercarriage there has a protective
540.959,542.55,"layer. So, if you're bumping into things"
542.56,543.829,"off-road, you're not going to have to be"
543.839,545.269,too concerned about puncturing that
545.279,548.07,battery. But each of the four wheels has
548.08,549.99,its own motor which allows you to do
550.0,551.91,some funky tricks when you're on the
551.92,554.07,inside tank style turns which I'm sure
554.08,555.59,you've seen. Hopefully we can find some
555.6,557.269,snow because it's for dirt or snow. It's
557.279,558.79,not going to work on regular pavement.
558.8,561.99,So getting up into the G Wagon is a bit
562.0,564.63,of a thing. There is this side step but
564.64,566.63,it's a little bit narrow. I honestly
566.64,568.79,tend to just jump like right in. Now I
568.8,570.23,don't know if that's going to be for
570.24,572.23,everyone. If you're shorter I feel like
572.24,573.91,you're going to have to step on that
573.92,575.829,"first. With my daughter, I was like"
575.839,577.75,"lifting her straight in. Like, you know"
577.76,578.63,what I'm saying? I have like a
578.64,579.91,5-year-old daughter. She's going
579.92,582.47,"straight in. For me, I guess I'm just"
582.48,584.31,going straight in. I'm just totally
584.32,586.23,ignoring that part there. And I also
586.24,587.99,noticed these headrests in their down
588.0,590.87,position are like in my back. Oh my god.
590.88,592.79,"So, that's going to have to be maxed"
592.8,595.19,"out. Oh, which it was, but then you have"
595.2,596.87,to put it down in order to fold them
596.88,598.949,"correctly. So, this is the actual"
598.959,600.79,"configuration, which there's lots of"
600.8,602.23,headroom. I don't know why I'm starting
602.24,603.75,"in the back seat here, but something to"
603.76,605.99,mention is the G Wagon looks like a big
606.0,607.509,vehicle from the outside. It's actually
607.519,609.91,not that big inside. Like I moved this
609.92,611.75,forward in order to get that fold to
611.76,613.269,"happen, but I would normally have this a"
613.279,615.269,little further back. I can fit two of me
615.279,617.509,"in here, but it's not like large SUV"
617.519,619.03,status. Probably many people already
619.04,620.55,know that. And the same goes for the
620.56,621.99,"width of it. It's pretty narrow. Now,"
622.0,623.509,these things aren't such a bad thing for
623.519,625.11,"off-roading, right? You get the short"
625.12,626.63,wheelbase. You can approach more
626.64,628.15,obstacles in that way. And this thing is
628.16,630.47,properly capable off-road even though a
630.48,631.99,lot of people just drive them around as
632.0,633.269,luxury vehicles. This does have
633.279,635.43,Burmester audio. You can see the dead
635.44,637.59,giveaway of these metallic grills which
637.6,639.59,are typically associated with Burmester.
639.6,643.03,We also have heated seats and a big
643.04,645.99,beautiful door handle. The same blue
646.0,647.75,stitching indicating to you that you got
647.76,649.19,"the electric model. Also, it just"
649.2,650.949,matches so well with this particular
650.959,652.71,paint option. Even the leathers are
652.72,654.63,"coming in multiple tones. So, this is"
654.64,656.23,really where I noticed the difference
656.24,658.47,from other electric vehicle options is
658.48,660.47,just like kind of the fit and finish and
660.48,662.389,the difference in options available to
662.399,664.31,really configure it to your own taste.
664.32,666.389,"Like, I've got a Cybert truck right now"
666.399,668.47,and there's nothing personalized about
668.48,670.23,it at all. Everybody's Cybertruck is
670.24,671.75,"essentially the same. Whereas, if you"
671.76,673.11,"buy one of these, you can really"
673.12,675.35,personalize it in how you set things up.
675.36,677.03,"Granted, you'll have to pay for those"
677.04,679.67,"options. Oh, lastly, Mercedes probably"
679.68,682.15,has like my favorite venting system
682.16,683.99,"where you can just reach up, grab, and"
684.0,686.23,direct. And it's just so intuitive. It's
686.24,688.23,the same up front. It's the same on a
688.24,690.55,"Sprinter van, but it's intuitive and"
690.56,692.23,"useful. Like, some things don't need to"
692.24,694.23,be engineered beyond that into the
694.24,695.99,"screen. Like on my Tesla, like I'm"
696.0,697.829,trying to point the airflow. This is
697.839,700.23,just you reach up and you can move it in
701.0,703.19,360° fashion. And then if you want to
703.2,704.79,"turn it off, you just spin it into the"
704.8,706.31,off position. I'll show you in the
706.32,707.67,"front. For me, getting in, I just grab"
707.68,709.03,the the steering wheel and I kind of
709.04,711.99,"come like that. It's not too bad for me,"
712.0,714.069,honestly. And then closing the door from
714.079,715.19,the inside might be better than the
715.2,717.829,"outside. I don't know. Listen. Oh, this"
717.839,719.11,is not something you're used to if
719.12,720.55,you've been driving electric vehicles
720.56,721.99,for a while. They are the complete
722.0,724.069,opposite. Just closing the door
724.079,727.35,reinforces the idea that you're in a
727.36,729.11,vault. It feels like you're inside of a
729.12,731.19,vault. Like everything is sealed up. If
731.2,732.55,you're like me and you've been driving
732.56,734.31,"electric cars for a while, you are not"
734.32,735.509,used to this at all. If you've been
735.519,737.11,"driving Teslas for a while, you're not"
737.12,739.19,used to this at all. The Hummer kind had
739.2,741.11,kind of a satisfying a slightly more
741.12,743.03,"satisfying, but nothing even close. I"
743.04,744.79,"mean, no car really that I'm aware of"
744.8,746.629,competes with the strength of that
746.639,748.069,latching system. It means you get
748.079,749.59,"heavier doors, you get a heavier"
749.6,752.389,vehicle. If there is a theme to this
752.399,754.87,"vehicle, it's this idea that you're not"
754.88,756.31,screaming at the world that you're
756.32,757.99,driving an electric vehicle. you're
758.0,760.949,making a lot of compromises on well
760.959,763.35,range for example in order to have a
763.36,765.99,vehicle that still almost in every way
766.0,767.829,feels like a gas powered vehicle. Even
767.839,769.269,the type of sounds that they're pumping
769.279,771.11,in. Like when I was driving my older kid
771.12,772.629,"in here, he was like, ""This feels like"
772.639,774.069,"you're driving a gas car."" It really"
774.079,775.829,does. This is the one that will fool
775.839,777.67,"people that if they're inside, you'll"
777.68,779.11,"have to tell them it's electric,"
779.12,780.389,otherwise they might not even think
780.399,781.99,about it. I believe that's the buyer
782.0,783.509,they're looking for. the person that
783.519,785.35,wants to buy electric but doesn't want
785.36,787.269,anybody to know about it or at least
787.279,789.75,wants to play down the electric aspect
789.76,791.99,and wants to kind of fly under the radar
792.0,793.829,a little bit. Although in this color
793.839,795.75,like you're not flying under any radar.
795.76,798.15,This color of G Wagon moving around town
798.16,800.629,"like people are are taking note. Anyway,"
800.639,802.069,what can we say? The steering wheel is
802.079,803.75,"one of my favorite aspects. Honestly,"
803.76,805.509,I've been using the steering yolk on the
805.519,807.99,Tesla. This steering wheel is just a
808.0,810.31,beauty. It's fat. It's got this
810.32,813.11,perforated feel. It heats up really hot.
813.12,814.71,"Though, it did take me a while to figure"
814.72,816.47,out where you turn on the heated
816.48,817.829,steering wheel. You can do so in the
817.839,819.269,"interface, but there's pretty much a"
819.279,820.87,button or switch for almost everything.
820.88,822.069,And that's the same for the heated
822.079,823.59,steering wheel. It's over here below the
823.6,825.59,wiper control. And it's a little twist
825.6,827.19,to turn on the steering wheel. Heated
827.2,829.11,seats are over here on the left. This
829.12,832.629,has some sort of rapid heated seat
832.639,835.03,"system, which is especially good on an"
835.04,836.47,electric vehicle because these things
836.48,839.11,are more efficient at heating you up
839.12,840.79,"comparative to the whole car, and they"
840.8,842.71,heat up before the whole car heats up.
842.72,845.829,"So, these things get steaming quick. The"
845.839,847.75,other thing you can option in here is
847.76,849.91,"heating for the armrests as well, which"
849.92,851.59,is kind of a nice touch. We have a lot
851.6,853.99,"of adjustment for the seat. You know,"
854.0,855.75,"everything, even the headrest is"
855.76,858.31,adjustable via the motorized
858.32,860.629,adjustments. We can also extend the leg
860.639,862.23,"rest. If you have longer legs, you can"
862.24,863.43,bring this out. If you have shorter
863.44,865.509,"legs, you can bring it in. The steering"
865.519,868.87,"wheel telescoping adjustable also in,"
868.88,871.11,"out, up, and down. This is what I'm"
871.12,875.11,"talking about. On, off, and point where"
875.12,877.509,"you like it. I mean, what more do you"
877.519,880.55,"want? It is so fast, so intuitive."
880.56,882.629,Anybody who gets in this car immediately
882.639,884.629,understands what to do if they want the
884.639,886.23,"air on them, if they don't want the air"
886.24,887.829,"on them, if they want it on, or if they"
887.839,889.829,want it off. Beautifully simple. In some
889.839,891.75,"cases, the mechanical solution is still"
891.76,893.59,superior to the software solution. It
893.6,894.87,does mean you end up with extra
894.88,897.15,"components, but it is a satisfying"
897.16,899.35,"experience, lending itself to this whole"
899.36,901.59,like rugged atmosphere. This giant
901.6,903.43,"handle, that thing is just solid. It"
903.44,904.87,"says addition one on it, and we can"
904.88,906.629,start to appreciate this carbon fiber
906.639,908.47,with these little blue accents as we
908.48,910.389,look around the cockpit. We have our two
910.399,912.23,cup holders here. They are heated and
912.24,914.069,cooled. They got a cool mechanism as
914.079,915.67,"well, depending on the cup size that you"
915.68,917.75,"put in there. One cup is really small,"
917.76,919.67,so it's held by that. The next cup is
919.68,921.75,"medium, and then a large cup will push"
921.76,923.75,down the entirety of the spring-loaded
923.76,925.43,element. Wireless charging for your
925.44,926.949,phone is here. Then you still get
926.959,930.55,"another DC, two USBC ports as well. So,"
930.56,932.47,lots of flexibility for your devices.
932.48,934.23,You can also close this whole section.
934.24,936.23,And I like this carbon fiber surface
936.24,938.629,with that release. They kind of roll up
938.639,940.55,into there if you keep it in its open
940.56,942.87,"position. By having the dual open, you"
942.88,944.629,"don't get the big lid, so you can access"
944.639,948.15,it from either side. Boom. Glove box.
948.16,949.829,Got a little bit of space. There's a pen
949.839,951.829,holder. I think we can also outfit this
951.839,954.15,with the whole like scent system for the
954.16,955.35,experience. I don't know. I might be
955.36,956.55,wrong about that. What's worth
956.56,958.31,mentioning now is there's a pretty
958.32,960.069,extensive ambient lighting system in
960.079,961.67,"here, which I started to connect with"
961.68,963.509,Mercedes in general. It's now here in
963.519,965.11,"the G Wagon. So, even though this thing"
965.12,967.91,is meant to be a vault and meant to be
967.92,970.069,an off-road machine and meant to be
970.079,972.15,"rugged, it's also luxurious. Like, it's"
972.16,974.47,this weird kind of mix of things that
974.48,977.03,these buyers want. This off-road rugged
977.04,979.35,"appeal, but then at the same time, they"
979.36,981.269,want luxury. That's a tough thing to
981.279,983.11,"mix, but Mercedes is doing it in the G"
983.12,984.79,"Wagon. That's their whole agenda. So,"
984.8,986.31,you've got ambient lighting. It's even
986.32,987.749,in the vents. It's in all kinds of
987.759,989.43,"different areas. So, we still have a lot"
989.44,992.47,"of buttons to work with here, including"
992.48,993.99,like this big touch pad in the middle
994.0,995.67,"for interacting with the touchcreen. So,"
995.68,997.829,the UI is controlled either via touch.
997.839,999.269,"You can just reach up and touch, or you"
999.279,1000.87,"can use this touchpad, which I haven't"
1000.88,1002.55,"seen one of these in a while, but this"
1002.56,1004.23,used to be a common thing with car
1004.24,1006.15,"manufacturers. So, this is obviously a"
1006.16,1007.67,more natural place for your hand to
1007.68,1009.749,rest. I found myself actually using this
1009.759,1011.35,and not getting fingerprints on the
1011.36,1013.99,screen. It does often require a couple
1014.0,1015.67,more presses. rather than just reach up
1015.68,1017.829,"and touch, I have to toggle around like"
1017.839,1019.749,that. But you get good at it and some of
1019.759,1020.79,these things you don't have to be
1020.8,1022.55,"incredibly rapid with. So, you end up"
1022.56,1023.91,using it and then other times you just
1023.92,1025.429,reach up and touch. Something I want to
1025.439,1027.11,"mention here in the charging section,"
1027.12,1029.029,which is really cool because this thing
1029.039,1032.309,is not like a range monster. They've got
1032.319,1033.829,this setting here in order to maximize
1033.839,1036.15,your range. And you can see in a glimpse
1036.16,1038.15,what's using all of your power and if
1038.16,1039.99,you restrict some certain element of the
1040.0,1041.829,"vehicle, what you can gain back in"
1041.839,1043.59,"range. So, like if I restricted the"
1043.6,1045.35,"climate functions, I could add up to 16"
1045.36,1048.309,km of range. If I change to eco driving
1048.319,1050.63,"from comfort, I could add up to 35 km"
1050.64,1052.47,range. Or I can just click in the center
1052.48,1054.31,"where it says maximize range, and that"
1054.32,1055.99,will add the two of them together in
1056.0,1057.83,order to give you your maximum range.
1057.84,1059.27,"Now, when I did that while I was"
1059.28,1060.95,"driving, it actually turned this screen"
1060.96,1063.029,off. If you're really serious about
1063.039,1064.789,"maximizing the range of the vehicle, you"
1064.799,1066.15,can do that. They're not going to win
1066.16,1069.27,any range competitions compared to I
1069.28,1070.549,"don't even know what the competition is,"
1070.559,1071.99,so it doesn't even matter. Like what is
1072.0,1073.27,the competition for this? There really
1073.28,1076.95,"isn't. I mean, Rivian, maybe these are"
1076.96,1079.35,not the same buyer. A G Wagon buyer and
1079.36,1082.15,a Rivian buyer. Is that the same person?
1082.16,1084.789,This is for me a person who already knew
1084.799,1086.63,"they wanted a G Wagon and then said,"
1086.64,1088.47,"""hm, there's an electric one. Let me"
1088.48,1090.15,"consider that."" Or somebody who"
1090.16,1091.83,legitimately wants an electric vehicle
1091.84,1093.35,that does not look like an electric
1093.36,1095.19,"vehicle. Because Rivians, they're kind"
1095.2,1096.63,"of boxy, but they still look like"
1096.64,1098.63,"electric vehicles. Tesla Cybertruck, oh"
1098.64,1100.39,"my god, everyone knows the Hummers and"
1100.4,1104.15,"EV. It's truly a G Wagon electric, not"
1105.16,1107.51,"EQSG. You know what I'm saying? Anyway,"
1107.52,1109.43,so you can control this from here.
1109.44,1111.59,"Maximize your range. So, if I click on"
1111.6,1113.669,"comfort here, I got massage seats,"
1113.679,1116.15,"classic hot, relaxing back, ambient"
1116.16,1118.31,lighting. I can manage from here. And it
1118.32,1121.35,does have the energizing comfort. Full
1121.36,1123.27,"luxury in that regard. Like, this is"
1123.28,1125.35,"S-Class stuff. So, I can select from a"
1125.36,1127.51,variety of moods. and it's going to
1127.52,1130.87,smell nice and whisk me away to the
1130.88,1132.63,"seaside. Now, one of the coolest"
1132.64,1133.75,"sections on the vehicle, I'll have to"
1133.76,1134.87,show you when we're driving. It's right
1134.88,1136.63,here. It's the off-road cockpit. This is
1136.64,1138.15,where we do our tank turn. They call it
1138.16,1140.31,"a G turn. Honestly, it's kind of"
1140.32,1141.909,mind-blowing when you do it. You can't
1141.919,1143.909,help but smile. It's a number of steps
1143.919,1145.75,to make it happen. We got to find some
1145.76,1148.31,"snow so I can show you guys that. So, I"
1148.32,1151.7,will play some music.
1172.28,1174.63,"man, like I don't know, man. I still"
1174.64,1176.31,like something about buttons. And that's
1176.32,1178.549,not just the old man in me. They're
1178.559,1180.39,fast. Like if I just want to turn the
1180.4,1182.15,"fan off, boom, it's off. There's a a"
1182.16,1183.669,"certain muscle memory to it, right? I"
1183.679,1185.669,know the location of it already. I can
1185.679,1187.43,still look at the road and hit that
1187.44,1190.15,versus trying to find a very specific
1190.16,1192.23,spot to press on the display if it's a
1192.24,1194.789,"touchcreen. All right, so we're out. G"
1194.799,1197.909,Wagon feels like a Gwag. Like I feel
1197.919,1200.87,boxy. I feel the stiffness of it. It
1200.88,1203.029,feels utilitarian. And I feel also
1203.039,1204.95,elevated. Like I feel high up in here.
1204.96,1206.549,"One thing about G Wagons, I'm not sure"
1206.559,1208.549,"if people know, electric or otherwise,"
1208.559,1210.71,is they're not that huge inside. Like Mo
1210.72,1212.549,is like right here. Like I'm infringing
1212.559,1214.07,on Mo right now. There's a reason for
1214.08,1215.909,that. This was a utilitarian vehicle and
1215.919,1218.47,it still looks and behaves a lot like
1218.48,1220.789,the original military vehicle. When you
1220.799,1222.15,"toggle the wipers, look at these little"
1222.16,1223.59,baby wipers. Look at those things right
1223.6,1225.99,there. Utilitarian. See what I'm saying?
1226.0,1228.31,"Now, the sounds that are being pumped in"
1228.32,1230.31,are convincing. It doesn't have those
1230.32,1232.789,kind of pew pew Star Wars type of
1232.799,1234.789,"feedback. Obviously, that sound is being"
1234.799,1236.63,"pumped in, but it is convincing. You're"
1236.64,1237.909,"like, ""What are these paddle shifters"
1237.919,1239.19,"for?"" This is going to change your"
1239.2,1241.11,"recuperation mode. Currently, we're in"
1241.12,1242.63,comfort and it's in intelligent
1242.64,1244.149,"recuperation, which is some sort of"
1244.159,1245.99,dynamic mode. But I can also turn
1246.0,1247.83,"recuperation off completely. So, you see"
1247.84,1249.669,the car just rolls. I love this. I love
1249.679,1251.43,to have options in this regard because
1251.44,1253.35,sometimes it can drive me crazy having
1253.36,1255.11,too much recuperation. Every
1255.12,1256.63,manufacturer has sort of approached this
1256.64,1257.909,"differently, but look at that. That's no"
1257.919,1259.19,recuperation. This is going to hurt your
1259.2,1260.63,"range obviously, but for those coming"
1260.64,1262.149,from gas powered vehicles or drive
1262.159,1263.75,"different vehicles, that can be a"
1263.76,1265.669,satisfying experience to just feel the
1265.679,1267.83,"roll of the car. I can go to normal,"
1267.84,1269.99,"strong, maximum. Let's feel what the"
1270.0,1272.149,maximum recuperation is like. It's
1272.159,1273.47,probably going to feel like
1273.48,1276.149,"breaking. Yeah, it feels like breaking"
1276.159,1277.669,as soon as my foot comes off the
1277.679,1278.95,accelerator. I don't mind that
1278.96,1280.549,implementation either. It makes me more
1280.559,1282.47,inclined to like interact with it and
1282.48,1284.549,modify it than I would otherwise do if
1284.559,1286.31,it was buried in some menu. That's the
1286.32,1287.909,story of this car. Very few things are
1287.919,1289.27,buried in menus. Everything is
1289.28,1291.11,accessible to you close by. The
1291.12,1293.789,"steering, you can see here,"
1293.799,1296.47,"very responsive and stiff. Like I said,"
1296.48,1298.07,"and that's in comfort mode. Obviously,"
1298.08,1299.51,"there's different driving modes, plenty"
1299.52,1301.27,"of them to choose from. Sport, you've"
1301.28,1303.029,"also got comfort, trail, rock, and then"
1303.039,1305.029,you can set up your own individual. In
1305.039,1307.669,"sport mode, your responsiveness."
1307.679,1309.909,There goes thrown back there. And it
1309.919,1311.99,"actually it's a little squirly, like in"
1312.0,1313.99,a fun way. She's a little squirly. Did
1314.0,1315.59,"you feel what I'm talking about? I did,"
1315.6,1319.31,dude. It still has that sportiness to it
1319.32,1322.35,somehow. Like it's a
1322.36,1325.43,little She'll get you now. It's not like
1325.44,1328.07,that murder power of the Cybert truck.
1328.08,1329.75,That's some murder power. The actual
1329.76,1332.31,acceleration on this is not quite as
1332.32,1335.029,quick as the G63 with the big motor in
1335.039,1336.71,"it, but it feels plenty fast on a"
1336.72,1337.909,vehicle like this. And obviously with
1337.919,1339.909,"the electric, it's like instant. That"
1339.919,1341.909,kind of like really immediate feedback
1341.919,1343.51,that makes up for it. You I don't think
1343.52,1345.029,you're going to notice a huge difference
1345.039,1346.47,even though on paper the numbers are
1346.48,1348.23,different. It's plenty fun. Enough
1348.24,1350.789,acceleration for plenty of fun. The
1350.799,1352.71,"sound is kind of convincing. No. Yeah,"
1352.72,1354.149,it is. It's kind of convincing. It
1354.159,1356.75,really sounds like it's coming from
1356.76,1358.789,there. There's part of me that knows
1358.799,1360.39,"that it's simulated, but at a certain"
1360.4,1362.39,"point, you stop thinking about that."
1362.4,1364.149,Just to have that note associated with
1364.159,1365.669,"your acceleration, you can't help it."
1365.679,1366.789,There's something satisfied about it. I
1366.799,1367.75,don't know. I don't know how to pinpoint
1367.76,1369.19,"it. Like, why do we have to hear that?"
1369.2,1370.71,Why do we need to hear that rumble when
1370.72,1372.71,we go fast? Why? We're used to it. We
1372.72,1374.71,grow up with it. I'm not sure. But this
1374.72,1376.95,is definitely the electric vehicle
1376.96,1378.71,"that's the least electric, if you know"
1378.72,1380.39,what I'm saying. As far as range is
1380.4,1381.83,"concerned, gives you two numbers. So, it"
1381.84,1383.029,gives you the range and then it gives
1383.039,1385.43,you the max range. And the numbers are
1385.44,1388.31,"drastically different. So, 191 km of"
1388.32,1391.669,"range, but 278 km of max range, that's"
1391.679,1393.75,almost 100 km different. But if I go
1393.76,1395.83,ahead and just click maximize range in
1395.84,1398.07,"the center, it will dial back all of"
1398.08,1399.75,those consumption features. And what
1399.76,1401.59,it's going to say is all energy saving
1401.6,1403.35,measures are active. This display will
1403.36,1405.19,"switch off shortly. Just like that, we"
1405.2,1407.83,are now in the maximum range mode. The
1407.84,1408.87,"other thing I want to mention, there is"
1408.88,1410.789,this eco mode display. I can change this
1410.799,1412.39,"in the center, but it kind of shows how"
1412.4,1414.47,your driving habit is also affecting
1414.48,1416.23,your range. There's a real range
1416.24,1418.07,component to this. And I have this ball
1418.08,1419.43,in the center that sort of turns it into
1419.44,1422.789,"a game. If I slam on the pedal, you'll"
1422.799,1424.95,"see get a little squirly again. Anyway,"
1424.96,1426.549,you'll see it'll go red. Essentially
1426.559,1427.83,letting you know that you're driving
1427.84,1429.11,"like an idiot. I mean, I don't know that"
1429.12,1430.31,I need to see that cuz I already know
1430.32,1431.83,"that, but if you're really trying to do"
1431.84,1433.669,"this range challenge, then you have that"
1433.679,1435.029,feedback as an option. You can change
1435.039,1436.87,whatever's on this display. Attention
1436.88,1438.95,"assist, your audio source. I think the"
1438.96,1440.71,eco display is probably the most fun out
1440.72,1443.669,of the bunch.
1443.679,1445.909,Spin. I guess we got to spin. We got to
1445.919,1449.549,find a spin
1449.559,1452.83,spot. Go down to rock.
1452.84,1457.11,Activate. Low range. Back into neutral.
1457.12,1463.789,You spin to drive. And then we g
1463.799,1468.549,turn. Damn.
1468.559,1472.39,That is so sick. Like it doesn't seem
1472.4,1474.549,possible. Should I do one more? Yeah.
1474.559,1488.43,Did you like that mo back to the G
1488.44,1491.43,turn? We're like fully going down this
1491.44,1494.87,"hill in G turns. Listen, I don't doubt"
1494.88,1497.43,this is a real off-road thing. This car
1497.44,1502.97,is a real off-road thing.
1508.72,1511.029,That was insane. That was crazy. And
1511.039,1513.43,then let's see our circle. Look at our
1513.44,1517.669,"circle. Look at our circle, bro. Wow."
1517.679,1520.59,Let's see it in real
1520.6,1526.44,life. Wow. Did you see that?
