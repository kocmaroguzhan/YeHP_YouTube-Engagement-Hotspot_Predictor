0,20,"We 're going to go for it . Yeah . All right . This is the new electric G Wagon , but they 're still calling it a G Wagon . And it is very much a G Wagon . And the best way to know that you 're"
20,40,dealing with a G Wagon is right here . Let 's just get this out of the way away . It 's like a vault . You know what ? It 's not even just when you open and close the doors . It 's also when you lock them . Listen to this . Are you kidding ? Listen .
40,60,"Unlock . It is just so mechanical in that regard and you 're not used to it with electric vehicles . This is a special like addition one . It has a few different elements associated with that . It is quite an expensive option package . And the paint itself , at least in terms of Canadian dollars , is like 8,000 bucks . But it 's a G Wagon , ladies and gentlemen ,"
60,80,"and you expect to pay for this level of premium . For me , this does n't feel like , hey , I 'm an electric vehicle . I mean , in this case , maybe the blue coloring kind of gives it away a little bit . That 's an unusual color for a G Wagon , but they 've really retained tradition , which is what I think people wanted them to do with the G Wagon if it were to"
80,100,"go electric . So , you 're still getting that whole origin and history and ruggedness and boxiness , which is rare for electric vehicles . You 'd be hardressed to say , "" Hey , that 's the electric one . "" Because they 're still selling one that looks almost identical to this that 's gasoline powered . There 's a few giveaways that this is electric from"
100,120,"the outside , but like I said , you have to know what you 're looking for . So , this little EQ badge is probably the most obvious component , which says electric . There 's also this little blue strip that travels down the side , which also indicates that this is the electric model . But if you look at the back , it still says G580 on it . The little backpack is one more"
120,140,"giveaway . So rather than have a spare tire here , if I unlock the car , now I can open the backpack . Currently , they 've just got the charge cable in here . I guess you could fit a few other items . And it 's nice that it locks when the car locks , but it is fairly narrow . the door to the rear gets lighter weight , so you do n't have to work so hard to slam it ."
140,160,"It still sounds awesome . And the other thing is you can kind of hear that that sound that it makes . That 's another giveaway , I suppose . But the G Wagon as a whole , not just the electric model for 2025 , has a lot of modern upgrades . Adaptive cruise control , stay in its lane , the infotainment system . Obviously , this one has EQ"
160,180,"specific features on it . Other things that are kind of specific to this edition , one steps on the side . certain black and chrome elements . The grill is something that I wanted to talk about as well because some of the early videos I saw in the electric G Wagon , they had this really modern looking electrified grill which was n't really a grill . It was more like a cap on the"
180,200,"front . I did n't like the look of it because again , it 's like it 's a G Wagon . Let 's just keep looking like a G Wagon . So what if it 's not the most efficient electric vehicle in the world ? People who buy these things , they want them to look sort of like military vehicles . So , I prefer this traditional grill , even if it 's an electric vehicle that has no use for it . The other thing that that kind of cap grill does is it"
200,220,"brings a two - tone black over this portion that surrounds the headlights . I just did n't like the look of it very much , but I did see it in some of the earlier videos . It is an option . So , it 's like 1,600 bucks if you put that more futuristic black glossy finish on the front rather than the traditional grill . So , I would say do n't even bother doing that . And I think that this addition one is"
220,240,"actually a pretty good and nice looking setup . It also gives you these wheels , so you get the black wheels instead , which look better . And if you look closely , you can see the brake calipers in that blue color , which matches the tone of the paint . The mirrors , they fold in . I think these tints came from the factory as well . To charge it up , it 's on the right hand side . You press here . There we go . It"
240,260,"flies open . So , it is assisted . And then it is locking . So , you press this button here in order to unlock that charge port . Just remember to close it . No fancy motorized like sliding door like the Tyan . It 's just you just press the button , it flings open , plug in and charge and uh get going with your G Wagon . And this is another thing for 2025 . We can now"
260,280,"approach the vehicle and have it just unlock with the key in our pocket . We do n't need to actually initiate it . And actually before I get inside , I want to mention one more thing that kind of coincides with that . The little G area on the button itself , mechanical button . So now if I were to approach the vehicle , it would initially unlock and then I would press the button and open the door ."
280,300,"And I just noticed we got a pretty cool badge here . MercedesBenz , how do I even say that word ? Shockle approved . It sounds tough . Sounds rugged . Anyway , we 'll talk more about the interior in a moment , but like this latch . This is the latch that we all love . Look at how robust this latch is . Listen to"
300,320,"that . Damn , dude . You just feel every day . Imagine every day you get in the car just bam . Uh , it 's funny cuz it 's a Segway and I 'm looking for a Segway . Thank you to Segue for sponsoring this video and bringing us their brand new Ninebot Max G3 . A lot of people have been saying positive things about this"
320,340,"thing . I watched a bunch of videos before they sent it over . It is just a complete package and I think they 're having promotions . Check the description . But this thing has a big range . very smooth , a maximum of 80 km or 50 mi . It has good speed with a maximum of 45 km an hour , which is 28 mph . It can drive"
340,360,up inclines up to 30 % . You have suspension on your front end and also on the rear as well . You got this new improved display which is going to show you your range . You got a sport mode for speed . You 've got a walk mode if you want to walk beside . The entire thing folds down into a small package so you can put it in the back of a car . Just a threeprong to charge it up . And this
360,380,"also has a gasket for weather resistance . Big beefy grips , comfortable brake locations , and then lighting . We have signals on either side . Bright headlight . This straight line coming behind them . You 've even got a little bell . So , we 've actually got pretty wide tires on here . These are 11 in . And they do n't really tell you to go off - road . This is not their off - road"
380,400,"centric model , but these have some selfsealing attributes . It makes them a little bit tougher to puncture . It 's also got something called air lock . When you approach it with your app in your pocket , it 'll unlock . And they 've also integrated with Apple Find My . So if your Max G3 happens to go missing , you can track it down . Damn , dude . You just feel every day . Imagine every day you"
400,420,"get in the car , just bam . Do n't get your finger stuck in there , right , Will ? Okay . To the rear . Really big opening . Quite a bit of cargo space . They say that the electric variant has I think they said like 3 cubic feet less cargo , but essentially what you 're looking at here is cargo space that 's similar to the standard G Wagon . You have some tie down areas here . We have a cargo"
420,440,"cover which we can pull back . We can also remove it if we choose to , which is what I normally do with these things . So , I can get even more cargo volume and I 'm always putting hockey sticks and sports equipment into my vehicle . So , these things tend to get in the way . We 've also got a 12vt on the side . This is going to be good for your portable fridge that you might want to keep in the back here . That would be good . Now , there is an interesting"
440,460,"way in which the seats fold . It 's a two - step situation . First , what we do is we pull the seat itself . There 's a little handle for that . So , this portion goes up first , and then you 're going to have to have this headrest in the down position because what happens next , you click this lever , and then this comes down and fits in there . So , it 's a two - step situation . The"
460,480,"same is the case for the other side . So , you 've got this 60/40 split situation . Now , the only thing I noticed with this setup is that if these seats are too far back , see what I mean ? It 'll go , but it just kind of bumps into it if these seats are too far back . If this seats up a little further , it makes it a lot easier . It also has a couple different spots"
480,500,"that it can be stopped in . I do n't know anybody that would want to sit there like this , but maybe if you need extra cargo in the back , that could be useful . There is also a pass through if you want to just put a long item through the center . the seats down . You go with the pass through instead if you want to put skis or I guess I could have put a hockey stick like that too . I should talk about trim while we 're back here . We get this carbon fiber . This is"
500,520,"our first glance at the carbon fiber we 're going to see throughout the vehicle . And they found a way to get a little bit of blue in there . Very subtle , but it is in there . And that same blue stitching here on this big panel . And you 're going to see it throughout the vehicle in different spots as well . There 's also puddle projectors . And actually , you can get them configured a couple different ways . One of them says stronger than time . That 's what the addition"
520,540,"one says . It says stronger than time . It has a big G. You can also just get a Mercedes emblem if you prefer . And then there 's no frunk because there 's all kinds of tech in here , including a really large battery . I think it 's 116 kWh underneath . They did actually because this thing is meant to off - road . They put extra protection in the battery area . So , the entire undercarriage there"
540,560,"has a protective layer . So , if you 're bumping into things off - road , you 're not going to have to be too concerned about puncturing that battery . But each of the four wheels has its own motor which allows you to do some funky tricks when you 're on the inside tank style turns which I 'm sure you 've seen . Hopefully we can find some snow because it 's for dirt or snow . It 's not going to work on regular pavement . So getting up"
560,580,"into the G Wagon is a bit of a thing . There is this side step but it 's a little bit narrow . I honestly tend to just jump like right in . Now I do n't know if that 's going to be for everyone . If you 're shorter I feel like you 're going to have to step on that first . With my daughter , I was like lifting her straight in . Like , you know what I 'm saying ? I have like a 5 - year - old daughter . She 's going"
580,600,"straight in . For me , I guess I 'm just going straight in . I 'm just totally ignoring that part there . And I also noticed these headrests in their down position are like in my back . Oh my god . So , that 's going to have to be maxed out . Oh , which it was , but then you have to put it down in order to fold them correctly . So , this is the actual configuration ,"
600,620,"which there 's lots of headroom . I do n't know why I 'm starting in the back seat here , but something to mention is the G Wagon looks like a big vehicle from the outside . It 's actually not that big inside . Like I moved this forward in order to get that fold to happen , but I would normally have this a little further back . I can fit two of me in here , but it 's not like large SUV status . Probably many people already know that . And the"
620,640,"same goes for the width of it . It 's pretty narrow . Now , these things are n't such a bad thing for off - roading , right ? You get the short wheelbase . You can approach more obstacles in that way . And this thing is properly capable off - road even though a lot of people just drive them around as luxury vehicles . This does have Burmester audio . You can see the dead giveaway of these metallic grills which are typically associated with Burmester . We"
640,660,"also have heated seats and a big beautiful door handle . The same blue stitching indicating to you that you got the electric model . Also , it just matches so well with this particular paint option . Even the leathers are coming in multiple tones . So , this is really where I noticed the difference from other electric vehicle options is just like kind of the fit and"
660,680,"finish and the difference in options available to really configure it to your own taste . Like , I 've got a Cybert truck right now and there 's nothing personalized about it at all . Everybody 's Cybertruck is essentially the same . Whereas , if you buy one of these , you can really personalize it in how you set things up . Granted , you 'll have to pay for those options . Oh , lastly , Mercedes probably has"
680,700,"like my favorite venting system where you can just reach up , grab , and direct . And it 's just so intuitive . It 's the same up front . It 's the same on a Sprinter van , but it 's intuitive and useful . Like , some things do n't need to be engineered beyond that into the screen . Like on my Tesla , like I 'm trying to point the airflow . This is just you reach up and you can move"
700,720,"it in 360 ° fashion . And then if you want to turn it off , you just spin it into the off position . I 'll show you in the front . For me , getting in , I just grab the the steering wheel and I kind of come like that . It 's not too bad for me , honestly . And then closing the door from the inside might be better than the outside . I do n't know . Listen . Oh , this is not something you 're used to if you 've been driving"
720,740,"electric vehicles for a while . They are the complete opposite . Just closing the door reinforces the idea that you 're in a vault . It feels like you 're inside of a vault . Like everything is sealed up . If you 're like me and you 've been driving electric cars for a while , you are not used to this at all . If you 've been driving Teslas for a while , you 're not used to this at all . The Hummer kind had kind of a"
740,760,"satisfying a slightly more satisfying , but nothing even close . I mean , no car really that I 'm aware of competes with the strength of that latching system . It means you get heavier doors , you get a heavier vehicle . If there is a theme to this vehicle , it 's this idea that you 're not screaming at the world that you 're driving an electric vehicle . you 're making a lot of"
760,780,"compromises on well range for example in order to have a vehicle that still almost in every way feels like a gas powered vehicle . Even the type of sounds that they 're pumping in . Like when I was driving my older kid in here , he was like , "" This feels like you 're driving a gas car . "" It really does . This is the one that will fool people that if they 're inside , you 'll have to tell them it 's electric , otherwise they might"
780,800,not even think about it . I believe that 's the buyer they 're looking for . the person that wants to buy electric but does n't want anybody to know about it or at least wants to play down the electric aspect and wants to kind of fly under the radar a little bit . Although in this color like you 're not flying under any radar . This color of G Wagon moving around town like people are are taking
800,820,"note . Anyway , what can we say ? The steering wheel is one of my favorite aspects . Honestly , I 've been using the steering yolk on the Tesla . This steering wheel is just a beauty . It 's fat . It 's got this perforated feel . It heats up really hot . Though , it did take me a while to figure out where you turn on the heated steering wheel . You can do so in the interface , but there 's pretty much a button or switch"
820,840,"for almost everything . And that 's the same for the heated steering wheel . It 's over here below the wiper control . And it 's a little twist to turn on the steering wheel . Heated seats are over here on the left . This has some sort of rapid heated seat system , which is especially good on an electric vehicle because these things are more efficient at heating you up comparative to the"
840,860,"whole car , and they heat up before the whole car heats up . So , these things get steaming quick . The other thing you can option in here is heating for the armrests as well , which is kind of a nice touch . We have a lot of adjustment for the seat . You know , everything , even the headrest is adjustable via the motorized adjustments . We can also"
860,880,"extend the leg rest . If you have longer legs , you can bring this out . If you have shorter legs , you can bring it in . The steering wheel telescoping adjustable also in , out , up , and down . This is what I 'm talking about . On , off , and point where you like it . I mean , what more do you want ? It is so fast , so"
880,900,"intuitive . Anybody who gets in this car immediately understands what to do if they want the air on them , if they do n't want the air on them , if they want it on , or if they want it off . Beautifully simple . In some cases , the mechanical solution is still superior to the software solution . It does mean you end up with extra components , but it is a satisfying experience , lending itself to this whole like"
900,920,"rugged atmosphere . This giant handle , that thing is just solid . It says addition one on it , and we can start to appreciate this carbon fiber with these little blue accents as we look around the cockpit . We have our two cup holders here . They are heated and cooled . They got a cool mechanism as well , depending on the cup size that you put in there . One cup is really small , so it 's held by that . The next cup is"
920,940,"medium , and then a large cup will push down the entirety of the spring - loaded element . Wireless charging for your phone is here . Then you still get another DC , two USBC ports as well . So , lots of flexibility for your devices . You can also close this whole section . And I like this carbon fiber surface with that release . They kind of roll up into there if you keep it"
940,960,"in its open position . By having the dual open , you do n't get the big lid , so you can access it from either side . Boom . Glove box . Got a little bit of space . There 's a pen holder . I think we can also outfit this with the whole like scent system for the experience . I do n't know . I might be wrong about that . What 's worth mentioning now is there 's a pretty extensive ambient lighting system"
960,980,"in here , which I started to connect with Mercedes in general . It 's now here in the G Wagon . So , even though this thing is meant to be a vault and meant to be an off - road machine and meant to be rugged , it 's also luxurious . Like , it 's this weird kind of mix of things that these buyers want . This off - road rugged appeal , but then at the same time , they want"
980,1000,"luxury . That 's a tough thing to mix , but Mercedes is doing it in the G Wagon . That 's their whole agenda . So , you 've got ambient lighting . It 's even in the vents . It 's in all kinds of different areas . So , we still have a lot of buttons to work with here , including like this big touch pad in the middle for interacting with the touchcreen . So , the UI is controlled either via touch . You can just reach up and touch , or you can use this"
1000,1020,"touchpad , which I have n't seen one of these in a while , but this used to be a common thing with car manufacturers . So , this is obviously a more natural place for your hand to rest . I found myself actually using this and not getting fingerprints on the screen . It does often require a couple more presses . rather than just reach up and touch , I have to toggle around like that . But you get good at it and some of these"
1020,1040,"things you do n't have to be incredibly rapid with . So , you end up using it and then other times you just reach up and touch . Something I want to mention here in the charging section , which is really cool because this thing is not like a range monster . They 've got this setting here in order to maximize your range . And you can see in a glimpse what 's using all of your power and if you restrict some certain element of the"
1040,1060,"vehicle , what you can gain back in vehicle , what you can gain back in range . So , like if I restricted the climate functions , I could add up to 16 km of range . If I change to eco driving from comfort , I could add up to 35 km range . Or I can just click in the center where it says maximize range , and that will add the two of them together in order to give you your maximum range . Now , when I did that while I was driving , it"
1060,1080,"actually turned this screen off . If you 're really serious about maximizing the range of the vehicle , you can do that . They 're not going to win any range competitions compared to I do n't even know what the competition is , so it does n't even matter . Like what is the competition for this ? There really is n't . I mean , Rivian , maybe these are not the same buyer . A G Wagon buyer and a Rivian"
1080,1100,"buyer . Is that the same person ? This is for me a person who already knew they wanted a G Wagon and then said , "" hm , there 's an electric one . Let me consider that . "" Or somebody who legitimately wants an electric vehicle that does not look like an electric vehicle . Because Rivians , they 're kind of boxy , but they still look like electric vehicles . Tesla Cybertruck , oh my god , everyone knows the"
1100,1120,"Hummers and EV . It 's truly a G Wagon electric , not EQSG . You know what I 'm saying ? Anyway , so you can control this from here . Maximize your range . So , if I click on comfort here , I got massage seats , classic hot , relaxing back , ambient lighting . I can manage from here . And it does have the"
1120,1140,"energizing comfort . Full luxury in that regard . Like , this is S - Class stuff . So , I can select from a variety of moods . and it 's going to smell nice and whisk me away to the seaside . Now , one of the coolest sections on the vehicle , I 'll have to show you when we 're driving . It 's right here . It 's the off - road cockpit . This is where we do our tank turn . They call it a G turn . Honestly , it 's"
1140,1160,"kind of mind - blowing when you do it . You ca n't help but smile . It 's a number of steps to make it happen . We got to find some snow so I can show you guys that . So , I will play some music ."
1160,1180,"man , like I do n't know , man . I still like something about buttons . And that 's not just the old man in me . They 're fast . Like if I just want to"
1180,1200,"turn the fan off , boom , it 's off . There 's a a certain muscle memory to it , right ? I know the location of it already . I can still look at the road and hit that versus trying to find a very specific spot to press on the display if it 's a touchcreen . All right , so we 're out . G Wagon feels like a Gwag . Like I feel boxy . I feel the"
1200,1220,"stiffness of it . It feels utilitarian . And I feel also elevated . Like I feel high up in here . One thing about G Wagons , I 'm not sure if people know , electric or otherwise , is they 're not that huge inside . Like Mo is like right here . Like I 'm infringing on Mo right now . There 's a reason for that . This was a utilitarian vehicle and it still looks and behaves a lot like the original military"
1220,1240,"vehicle . When you toggle the wipers , look at these little baby wipers . Look at those things right there . Utilitarian . See what I 'm saying ? Now , the sounds that are being pumped in are convincing . It does n't have those kind of pew pew Star Wars type of feedback . Obviously , that sound is being pumped in , but it is convincing . You 're like , "" What are these paddle shifters for ? "" This is going to change your recuperation"
1240,1260,"mode . Currently , we 're in comfort and it 's in intelligent recuperation , which is some sort of dynamic mode . But I can also turn recuperation off completely . So , you see the car just rolls . I love this . I love to have options in this regard because sometimes it can drive me crazy having too much recuperation . Every manufacturer has sort of approached this differently , but look at that . That 's no recuperation . This is going to hurt your range obviously , but"
1260,1280,"for those coming from gas powered vehicles or drive different vehicles , that can be a satisfying experience to just feel the roll of the car . I can go to normal , strong , maximum . Let 's feel what the maximum recuperation is like . It 's probably going to feel like breaking . Yeah , it feels like breaking as soon as my foot comes off the accelerator . I do n't mind that implementation either ."
1280,1300,"It makes me more inclined to like interact with it and modify it than I would otherwise do if it was buried in some menu . That 's the story of this car . Very few things are buried in menus . Everything is accessible to you close by . The steering , you can see here , very responsive and stiff . Like I said , and that 's in comfort mode . Obviously , there 's different driving modes , plenty of them"
1300,1320,"to choose from . Sport , you 've also got comfort , trail , rock , and then you can set up your own individual . In sport mode , your responsiveness . There goes thrown back there . And it actually it 's a little squirly , like in a fun way . She 's a little squirly . Did you feel what I 'm talking about ? I did , dude . It still has that sportiness to it"
1320,1340,"somehow . Like it 's a little She 'll get you now . It 's not like that murder power of the Cybert truck . That 's some murder power . The actual acceleration on this is not quite as quick as the G63 with the big motor in it , but it feels plenty fast on a vehicle like this . And obviously with the electric , it 's like instant . That"
1340,1360,"kind of like really immediate feedback that makes up for it . You I do n't think you 're going to notice a huge difference even though on paper the numbers are different . It 's plenty fun . Enough acceleration for plenty of fun . The sound is kind of convincing . No . Yeah , it is . It 's kind of convincing . It really sounds like it 's coming from there . There 's part of me that knows that it 's simulated , but at"
1360,1380,"a certain point , you stop thinking about that . Just to have that note associated with your acceleration , you ca n't help it . There 's something satisfied about it . I do n't know . I do n't know how to pinpoint it . Like , why do we have to hear that ? Why do we need to hear that rumble when we go fast ? Why ? We 're used to it . We grow up with it . I 'm not sure . But this is definitely the electric vehicle that 's the least electric , if you know what I 'm saying . As far as"
1380,1400,"range is concerned , gives you two numbers . So , it gives you the range and then it gives you the max range . And the numbers are drastically different . So , 191 km of range , but 278 km of max range , that 's almost 100 km different . But if I go ahead and just click maximize range in the center , it will dial back all of those consumption features . And what it 's"
1400,1420,"going to say is all energy saving measures are active . This display will switch off shortly . Just like that , we are now in the maximum range mode . The other thing I want to mention , there is this eco mode display . I can change this in the center , but it kind of shows how your driving habit is also affecting your range . There 's a real range component to this . And I have this ball in the center that sort of turns it into a"
1420,1440,"game . If I slam on the pedal , you 'll see get a little squirly again . Anyway , you 'll see it 'll go red . Essentially letting you know that you 're driving like an idiot . I mean , I do n't know that I need to see that cuz I already know that , but if you 're really trying to do this range challenge , then you have that feedback as an option . You can change whatever 's on this display . Attention assist , your audio source . I think the eco display is"
1440,1460,probably the most fun out of the bunch . Spin . I guess we got to spin . We got to find a spin spot . Go down to rock . Activate . Low range . Back into neutral . You spin to
1460,1480,drive . And then we g turn . Damn . That is so sick . Like it does n't seem possible . Should I do one more ? Yeah . Did you like
1480,1500,"that mo back to the G turn ? We 're like fully going down this hill in G turns . Listen , I do n't doubt this is a real off - road thing . This car is a real"
1500,1520,"off - road thing . That was insane . That was crazy . And then let 's see our circle . Look at our circle . Look at our circle , bro . Wow . Let 's see it in"
1520,1540,real life . Wow . Did you see that ?
