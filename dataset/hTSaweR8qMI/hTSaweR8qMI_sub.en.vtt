00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
We're going on some of the most
expensive dates in the world.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:08.008
Like this $500,000 date that includes the
entirety of Disneyland, all for ourselves…

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:15.215
a $100,000 date at this mega complex with
a massive waterpark and indoor ski resort…

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.918
a $50,000 private island date…

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.319
Best date ever!

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.456
a $10,000 date cooked by Gordon Ramsay…

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:25.792
and we even convinced
superstar singer Madison Beer

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.395
to go on a date with
my most awkward friend.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:31.632
All starting with this $1 date:
a Ferris Wheel!

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.699
- Here's $1.
- Ok.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.201
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.102
Take notes, men.

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:37.070
Is this safe?

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.675
I see why it's only $1.
The $1 date has now begun.

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:43.710
It's, uh, making a lot of noise.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.045
Why is it making that noise?

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:46.413
It's just the wind, right?

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.916
I usually film 20, 25 days a month,

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.984
and I don't really get to
spend much time with my fiancee,

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:54.855
so I literally picked this video so me and
my fiancee could spend more time together.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:57.758
I love you, even if you
didn't take me to Disneyland.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:58.725
Well… not yet.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.496
But for the final date in this video,
for the first time in history,

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:05.199
Disney reserved
the whole park just for us.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.934
That's it for the $1 date!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.437
Let's head out to the $10,000 dinner date—
After you, babe.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.840
Turn off the park.
I'll see you guys there.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.910
And now, the $10,000 date

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:19.913
where we're gonna be recreating
our first-ever date with sushi.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.215
- After you.
- Thank you.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:24.685
She doesn't know this, but Gordon Ramsay's
gonna be making us the meal for this date.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.586
Thank you.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.455
There you go.
You look really cute.

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:29.756
I picked this just for you.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:33.427
It's been a long time since my first date
with Thea, and now that we're engaged,

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:37.631
I'm really excited to explore the world's
most expensive dates with my fiancee.

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:40.701
You're probably wondering,
"Why is this the $10,000 date?"

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:41.568
Why is it?

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:45.439
Gordon Ramsay himself
is gonna be cooking our meals.

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:46.607
The Gordon Ramsay?

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:47.574
Yep. Come on in.

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.076
Welcome to Lucky Cat Miami!

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.377
It's nice meeting you!

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:51.144
How's it going?

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.380
What an amazing night
this is gonna be.

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:54.548
Oh, I'm excited. Yes.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:57.150
We're gonna kick off with some pea
guacamole with some delicious crackers.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:58.285
Did you say peacock?

00:01:58.352 --> 00:01:59.820
I said pea guac!

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:01.355
Oh, pea guac, oh…

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.589
Not peacock, babe.

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:07.194
To celebrate this $10,000 dinner,
some seriously exclusive sushi.

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:08.262
Ladies first.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:09.096
Cheers.

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:10.864
Yeah, this is good.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.469
We have a delicious gourmet fried chicken,
wonderful fried rice, and duck bao buns.

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:16.370
Duck tacos?

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:17.137
Bao buns!

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:17.871
Duck tacos.

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:19.239
Bao buns!

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:19.973
You can yell at me.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.843
I will do in a minute.
You're pushin' my limits, man. Enjoy.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.178
I want you to take the first bite.

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:26.613
I knew you were gonna do that.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.782
It's only the $10,000 date,

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.920
and we already have the world's best chef
cooking a romantic dinner for the 2 of us.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.922
Nothing could possibly
ruin this moment.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:35.422
Chef.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.423
What are you guys
doin' here?

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.224
No, no no, no.

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:38.692
- I got you.
- Come on, man!

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:40.527
Don't rip it!

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:42.362
I'm not ripping it, chef!
I'm not ripping it!

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:43.230
Oh my goodness, mate.

00:02:43.297 --> 00:02:44.831
Why are you disrespecting
his restaurant?

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.133
This is supposed to be
a romantic dinner!

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.234
Nolan, mine's burning.

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:48.569
That's it.
I'm done!

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:49.436
What are you?

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:50.771
An idiot sandwich!

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:51.939
That is worth 10K alone.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.473
You guys have turned it
to a nightmare!

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.678
For $10,000, Gordon had a romantic
surprise for our final course.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.082
This is nice!
This is romantic!

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:03.417
This is actually
very romantic.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.352
Aww. Thank you.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.521
This 10K date was amazing.

00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:10.724
I can't imagine how insane these dates
are gonna get later in the video.

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:14.094
The $50,000 date is this
entire private island,

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:17.798
so me and Thea brought some friends with
us to make this a quadruple date.

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:20.000
Wait, what?
What is that?

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:21.602
This is Tom,
the turkey.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.203
Please tell me we're
not eating Tom.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.338
We are not eating Tom.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:27.708
I didn't know if this was like a
Say-Hi-To-Your-Dinner thing as you arrive.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:32.012
We have this entire $50,000 island
and everything on it to ourselves.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.649
I say the best way to kick off
an island date is to go jet skiing!

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.317
Let's go!

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.119
Best date ever!

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:40.954
You might recognize Grizz and Hase

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:44.892
from the video where they spent 74 days in
the wilderness together.

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.295
The day I took that hood off and saw you
was the best day of my life!

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:52.766
And you saw these two when Josh spent
22 days in solitary confinement.

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.835
These three spent weeks away
from their wives,

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:57.171
so I thought I'd give them
some quality time together.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.273
This is the best date
we've ever been on!

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.541
Does the wife approve?

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:01.341
I approve!

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.745
This is how I make good with
all the people I put in prolonged places.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:09.149
Oh my gosh,
that was so close!

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.784
Hey, Jimmy!

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:11.885
It’s Nolan!

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:12.686
Yo!

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:15.255
Uh-oh,
we're bouncin'.

00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:17.357
Nolan is flying solo for this date,

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.260
but later on, he'll be going on
a date with Madison Beer.

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.162
I, uh—
the great outfit…

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.834
Everyone, the island is all yours.
Go do whatever you want!

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.238
So we all enjoyed the luxuries of
this $50,000 island date.

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:32.272
All right everyone,
heads up!

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:35.742
Like hitting golf balls that are also
fish food right into the ocean.

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.946
- Thea, you show me how it’s done.
- I actually don't know how to do this.

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:44.384
Now we're getting couples' massages
on the beach.

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:47.821
There is just a person on my back.
Very relaxing.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:50.324
Grizz and Hase were playing
some beach volleyball…

00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:52.626
against their wives, of course.

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:55.329
And Josh and Kenna were having
a picnic on the beach.

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.131
I forgive you for taking him away
from me for so long.

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:00.701
- Welcome in, guys.
- Oh wait, there's rose petals.

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:03.070
I mean, I laid those
just for you.

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:07.140
For 50 grand, we all get these
luxurious bungalows.

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:08.141
Where do the petals lead?

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:09.910
I mean, look where
the petals lead.

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:11.712
Into the lovely master suite.

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.881
I made a heart just for you.

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:16.517
It is so pretty.
And you picked them yourself?

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.352
- Oh, I made this myself.
- Wow.

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:21.522
And as the sun was setting on
this $50,000 date…

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:22.623
To our loved one!

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:23.557
Cheers!

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:26.226
…Nolan was the only one
at dinner without a date.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.829
Until Tom the turkey showed up.

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:30.964
Nolan, we found you a partner!

00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:32.299
Uh, I'm all good on Tom.

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.701
And after dinner,
we did some couples dancing.

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:36.203
Rate our dance move.

00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:38.071
Again. Got it?

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.073
Come on!

00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:46.580
And after dark, we had a beach campfire,
and I had a surprise for everyone.

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.182
Cue the fireworks show!

00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:54.888
And lightning at the same time!

00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:57.124
- Nolan, your date showed up!
- Tom the Turkey!

00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:58.825
Yo, why are you standin' so still?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.963
That's it for the $50,000 date!
I'll see you guys at the next one.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:05.499
For double the cost of
the previous date,

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:09.102
we get this massive indoor metropolis
all to ourselves.

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.637
There's a giant theme park,

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.973
the largest indoor
water park in America,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.042
even its own
weather control system

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:17.978
so they can have the largest indoor
ski slope in America.

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:19.079
Ooh, it's so cool.

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:20.380
This is terrifying!

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:21.715
And while Thea loves skiing…

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:23.684
I haven't told her…

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:26.453
I have no idea how to ski.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.522
Babe, this is massive!

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.927
You're scared?
Don’t be scared.

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:35.229
I'm not scared.

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:36.363
Nah. You're good.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.397
Hey, what's over there?

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:38.799
- What?
- I'm freakin' terrified.

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.501
- What did you say?
- I'm excited!

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:41.935
Ok, you got it?

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.571
Babe, grab the straight—

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:47.207
Babe, stop!

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:48.242
How do I stop?

00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:52.880
Babe, I'm starting to think
that you don't know how to ski.

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:54.181
No, I—
I know how to ski.

00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:55.816
- How do I stand up?
- I got you.

00:06:55.883 --> 00:06:57.251
Ah! Oh, no.

00:06:57.518 --> 00:06:58.352
Babe, stop!

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.253
Babe, help!

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:00.554
Thea, make me stop.

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:01.722
Ok. I got you.

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:06.293
How do I stop?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.327
Legs together!

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:10.898
Legs closed, legs closed!

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:12.266
What, are they not closed?

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:17.738
Yeah, skiing is so much fun.

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:19.273
Anyways, let's move on with the date!

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:21.808
With so much to explore in
this shopping metropolis,

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.977
it felt like doing ten dates in one!

00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:26.046
From winning prizes in an arcade…

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:28.615
…getting a hole-in-one
in mini golf…

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:30.017
- Look at that!
- Yeah!

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:32.352
…or building each other
custom teddy bears.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.420
I love it.

00:07:33.487 --> 00:07:37.157
And where I normally do these kinds of
videos by myself or with my friends,

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:40.994
doing this with the person I love most
was kind of magical.

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:47.301
Being able to do pretty much anything
you could ever want to do on a date—

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:50.137
It felt like being a kid in a candy store
…literally!

00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:51.672
Ooh, chocolate.

00:07:52.005 --> 00:07:53.807
Whoa. What is this?

00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:56.510
Uh. Hey, ma'am?
What is this?

00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:57.845
They're Hershey's.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:04.585
Can we replace these with Feastables?

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:05.519
Sure.

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:06.453
Ok. Oh!

00:08:07.554 --> 00:08:09.623
Much better! If you haven’t already,
try Feastables.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.358
It's the best-tasting chocolate
on the planet.

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:12.359
Let's keep the date going.

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:15.095
We now have an entire waterpark
to ourselves,

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:17.397
and we just wanna take
a relaxing swim together.

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:22.002
Isn't it crazy that we're
in the middle of a mall?

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:23.604
It's like as big as the ocean.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.974
Up next, we actually got Madison Beer to
go on a date with Nolan.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.675
Do you think Nolan has a chance with her?

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:31.778
We're about to find out.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:35.782
For the $250,000 date,
Madison Beer,

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:39.353
the two-time Grammy nominee,
platinum-selling artist,

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.322
with over 3.5 billion streams worldwide,

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:43.657
is going on a date with…

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:46.159
my awkward friend Nolan.

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:49.463
- Hello!
- Hey.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.031
- Great to meet you.
- How are you?

00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:52.733
Nice to meet you.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:54.902
And while Nolan is on his date with
Madison Beer,

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:57.104
me and Tareq are currently
tucked away in the bathroom

00:08:57.171 --> 00:09:00.407
with a walkie that communicates
directly to a mic in Nolan's ear.

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:01.575
Where are you from?

00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:03.143
- I'm from Long Island.
- New York?

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.278
Yes. Where are you from?

00:09:04.344 --> 00:09:06.313
Nebraska. Not much
out there besides corn.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:09.750
- Cool.
- Yeah.

00:09:09.816 --> 00:09:11.585
No, he's talking about corn!

00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:15.322
In this seven years I've known Nolan,
I have never seen him this nervous before.

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:20.294
So to help Nolan out, I spent $250,000
on Madison's dream date.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.531
From driving her favorite car,
getting VIP treatment at an MLB game,

00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:26.500
and an over-the-top sushi dinner,

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:29.870
all to give Nolan the best shot of
securing a second date.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.371
Tell her you like her outfit.

00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:32.206
A great outfit.

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:36.376
Thank you.

00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:38.212
We told the waiter to help us
wingman Nolan.

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:39.813
I'll be your server.
Welcome to Bar Siesta.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.448
You guys look amazing.
I like your shoes my man.

00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:42.149
Dude, thank you.

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.484
But it was quickly clear
that it wasn't working.

00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:45.185
How's the weather?

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:46.320
How's the weather?

00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:47.454
Cool.

00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:48.455
He’s falling apart.

00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:50.824
Nolan is not used to talking
to attractive women.

00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:52.826
- You've watched the videos before?
- I watch all the videos.

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:53.727
What's your favorite video?

00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:56.096
The one where they were underground
for 100 days.

00:09:56.163 --> 00:09:58.232
Madison Beer watches our videos.

00:09:58.298 --> 00:09:59.399
I never expected that.

00:09:59.466 --> 00:09:59.967
Same.

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:00.901
I don't really eat meat.

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:01.802
Vegan?
Vegetarian?

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:03.737
Pescatarian,
'cause I love sushi.

00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:05.472
They're getting to know each other,
this is nice.

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:08.308
- Sorry, I just got lost in your eyes.
- Aw, that's so sweet.

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:09.243
Ohh, he hit it!

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:10.477
He took the shot!

00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:12.579
I was staring into the abyss.
I don't…

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.081
- Oh, not my eyes?
- No.

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:18.085
As they finished eating,
I had one last idea to help Nolan.

00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:21.154
I want you to tip the waiter $10,000.
My card is in your wallet.

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:24.258
That guy was so nice.
I think we should tip $10,000.

00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:26.627
I would love nothing more.

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:28.662
- Nolan has a gift for you.
- We left a little something for you.

00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:30.364
Wait, are you guys serious?

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.665
- Thank you.
- I appreciate it.

00:10:31.732 --> 00:10:33.500
- Here are the keys.
- Thank you. Let's hit it.

00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:38.705
Madison really loves animals, so their
next stop on their date is an animal farm.

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:42.843
Nolan's only problem now was that
the petting zoo was an hour drive away.

00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:48.782
Me and Tareq are still listening in.

00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:52.419
What's it like going up in front of
thousands and thousands of people?

00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:53.720
I just love my fans.

00:10:53.787 --> 00:10:56.623
They're the reason I get to do
stuff like this and live my dreams.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.792
He's warming up and
he's getting better with time.

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.594
We made it to the second part of the date.

00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:03.830
The Gentle Barn, a sanctuary that
rescues abused animals.

00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:05.365
What made you start loving
animals so much?

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:09.636
I have a lot of anxiety, and I feel like
they just are a calming reminder of peace.

00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:10.971
I feel a sense of calm around you.

00:11:11.038 --> 00:11:12.606
You are smooth with it.

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:15.242
But visiting animals wasn't the only thing
on our agenda.

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:17.177
They're gonna give you guys $25,000,

00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:21.181
and I'm actually going to match them,
and I’m gonna give you another 25,000.

00:11:21.248 --> 00:11:23.617
And then it was time for me to ask
an important question.

00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:25.552
You two ready to head to
an Angels baseball game?

00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:26.687
- Let's do it.
- Sure am.

00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:30.090
Do you mind if me and my fiancee join you
guys for the next part of the date?

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:31.558
Am I allowed to say no?

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:32.426
No, 'cause I paid for it.

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:33.927
I mean, you paid for it, right?

00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:37.097
And then we had an entire suite to
ourselves at an Angels game.

00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:38.999
This view of the game is insane.

00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:41.368
We got custom jerseys with
our names on the back.

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:44.738
And after almost all of us
made it on the jumbotron…

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:48.008
a crowd began forming around us.

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:49.510
You'll be in a video, say "Hi."

00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:54.481
Anyways, we should probably head to
the next part of this date.

00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:57.417
And for the final part of
the $250,000 date—

00:11:57.484 --> 00:11:58.185
What are we
doing, Nolan?

00:11:58.252 --> 00:12:02.489
Sushi dinner and an ice skating rink with
some of the best sushi chefs on the earth.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.492
I can definitely say I've never
done anything like this.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.328
I gotcha, I gotcha.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.563
Thank you, Jimmy.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.665
Tonight we prepared for you all
a tasting menu.

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:13.300
How much does this
amount of fish cost?

00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:14.101
A couple thousand.

00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:16.303
How do you think we got up to
the 250K price tag?

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.672
Definitely looks like
my type of bite of sushi.

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:19.606
Oh my God.

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:22.209
- That is so good.
- Wow.

00:12:22.276 --> 00:12:26.313
And then we all enjoyed some of the best
sushi I've ever had in my entire life.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.748
This is the best date ever.

00:12:27.814 --> 00:12:29.716
- Thanks, Nolan.
- Anytime.

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:32.586
The 250K date, I think we could all agree,
was a lot of fun.

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:34.721
Nolan, you had a question
you wanted to ask.

00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:35.389
I do.

00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:37.591
Oh, God.

00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:42.396
Oh, Jesus.

00:12:42.663 --> 00:12:43.230
Oh, God.

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:45.732
My shoe was just untied.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.538
Would you like to go on a second date to
Disneyland with me?

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:53.173
Yes.

00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:54.775
Let's head on over!

00:12:54.842 --> 00:12:58.412
And now it is time for the most expensive
grand finale date.

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:00.948
We have Disneyland all to ourselves!

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:04.518
This is gonna be awesome.
Let's go ride some rides!

00:13:04.585 --> 00:13:06.954
Disney won't just hand over
their keys to anyone,

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.156
but for this once-in-a-lifetime date,

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:11.425
we were given the entire park
for one night.

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:14.194
And with so much to do,
we had to bring the boys,

00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:16.396
our friends from the island,
and of course…

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.831
Madison and Nolan.

00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:20.801
Yo, once we’re at the top,
this is gonna have a crazy view.

00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:26.139
But our first stop is this
absolutely insane Star Wars ride.

00:13:26.874 --> 00:13:27.774
All right, that's cool.

00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:30.711
Holy smokes!
Look how big this is!

00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:33.080
Normally, people can wait
hours for this ride,

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.681
but my friends and I walked right in.

00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:36.950
Yo, strap in.

00:13:37.017 --> 00:13:39.086
All right, who's ready for
the Star Wars ride?

00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:42.689
Is now a bad time to mention
I haven't seen the movies?

00:13:43.457 --> 00:13:43.957
What?

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:47.261
This is crazy!
How did Disney build all this?

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:48.562
This is wild.

00:13:49.296 --> 00:13:49.997
Oh my Gosh.

00:13:50.297 --> 00:13:51.932
Nolan, protect Madison!

00:13:52.566 --> 00:13:54.701
Yo, can you believe we're
doing this right now?

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:55.769
Yeah, this is insane!

00:14:00.741 --> 00:14:02.009
- That was awesome.
- Once in a lifetime!

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:02.709
This is crazy!

00:14:02.776 --> 00:14:03.410
That was amazing!

00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:06.079
Every other cart was empty.
We have this whole place to ourselves.

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:07.347
Disneyland is awesome!

00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:08.248
That was sick!

00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:10.484
And after that ride,
what could be cooler…

00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:13.020
…than building your own lightsaber?

00:14:13.554 --> 00:14:15.756
Oh, yeah!
Coolest lightsaber!

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.930
Up next, we're all gonna ride
this giant Ferris Wheel.

00:14:22.996 --> 00:14:24.598
We're back to where
this video started.

00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:26.266
You could say it went full circle.

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:30.504
I've never been on a Ferris Wheel
that looks like that!

00:14:30.571 --> 00:14:32.239
Yeah, this is massive!

00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:34.775
It feels like we're stepping into
an old movie.

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:36.643
Come on in, babe.

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:41.081
This is like the $1 date,
but in Disneyland and much bigger.

00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:42.015
Much bigger!

00:14:42.082 --> 00:14:43.717
You can see the entire
park up here.

00:14:43.817 --> 00:14:44.484
Wow!

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.386
How does this compare to
our $1 date?

00:14:47.154 --> 00:14:49.156
I mean, it's so much better.

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:51.158
It's very romantic here in Disney.

00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:53.393
Wonder what Nolan and
Madison are doing.

00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:55.829
Fist bump.

00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:57.898
Let's go.

00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:00.968
Things are not looking good for
Nolan right now.

00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:02.035
I can't wait to
play games.

00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:03.170
Yeah, that sounds fun.

00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:04.905
- Are you gonna win me something?
- Of course.

00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:05.873
Yay!

00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:07.040
Are you gonna win me something?

00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:08.909
Oh, you betcha!

00:15:08.976 --> 00:15:09.943
Let's go!

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.046
With his eye on the prize,
Nolan challenged me and Chandler

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:14.548
to a friendly competition.

00:15:14.615 --> 00:15:15.749
This is what you're
competing for.

00:15:15.816 --> 00:15:18.218
- A worm? Babe, do you want that worm?
- Yes, I really want it.

00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:19.853
Ok, boys, I'm gonna
have to win this one.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.221
- All right, I wanna win this for you.
- Please.

00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:23.757
3, 2, 1… Go!

00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:26.927
- Nolan!
- First one, first one.

00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:27.661
Let's go!

00:15:27.828 --> 00:15:28.896
It's, like, curving.

00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.097
Two! That's two!

00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:31.198
You need three to win.

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.403
This is the grand prize.
It's all yours.

00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:38.739
For you.

00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:44.678
You can feel the tension in
the air right now.

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:45.546
Gah, come here!

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.614
But you know I couldn't lose to
Nolan like that.

00:15:49.516 --> 00:15:50.651
Yes! Yes!

00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:52.386
Oh my goodness!

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:53.487
Let's run it back!

00:15:53.554 --> 00:15:54.054
Yes!

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:55.389
- Yay!
- Here y’go, babe.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.523
The Three P.
Here we go!

00:15:57.691 --> 00:15:58.725
We won again!

00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:00.027
That was fun!

00:16:00.694 --> 00:16:01.728
It's fun winning.

00:16:02.863 --> 00:16:08.035
There are no words to describe how special
it is to have Disneyland all to ourselves.

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:11.271
And I think we all made memories
that are gonna last a lifetime.

00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:13.841
Whoa, babe.
There's a puddle.

00:16:13.907 --> 00:16:15.375
You're a gentleman!

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:16.844
No wet feet for you.

00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:18.111
Take notes, boys.

00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:21.849
And to wrap things up,
we have one final surprise.

00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:25.152
We're gonna be eating dinner in
front of the Disney castle.

00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:26.253
- Oh my!
- What?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.456
All right, I don't know why Disney's going
all out for us, but thank you guys.

00:16:29.523 --> 00:16:30.691
- Oh my gosh.
- Wow!

00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:32.759
- This is crazy.
-This is beautiful!

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:34.661
Everyone, come on, sit down.

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:38.632
Cheers to the greatest date in history.

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:40.334
Cheers!

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:44.271
Yes! This was an awesome night.
I'm glad I can enjoy it with all of you.

00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:45.439
Cheers!

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.442
Of all the dates I took you on,
which one was your favorite?

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:49.877
Definitely this one.

00:16:49.943 --> 00:16:50.410
Yeah?

00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:53.647
Yeah, ‘cause everybody's here.
We should do this more!

00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:55.249
Rent all of Disneyland?

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:56.550
Yeah.

00:16:56.984 --> 00:16:57.918
That was awesome.

00:16:57.985 --> 00:17:01.955
And to wrap up the video,
for the first time in Disney's history,

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:04.258
they're going to do a private parade
for all of us.

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.026
Let's head on over.

00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:09.263
I gotta say, this date is gonna be
so hard to top.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:13.433
Huge thanks to Disney for absolutely
blowing our minds with this experience.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.235
This was truly a once in a lifetime.

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:17.437
If you don't have notifications on,
make sure you turn ‘em on

00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:18.805
so you don't ever miss a video.

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:19.606
