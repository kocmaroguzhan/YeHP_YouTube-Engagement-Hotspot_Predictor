180,185,This is nice ! This is romantic ! This is actually very romantic . Aww . Thank
185,190,you . This 10 K date was amazing . I ca n't imagine how insane these dates are gon na get
190,195,"later in the video . The $ 50,000 date is this entire private island , so me and Thea"
195,200,"brought some friends with us to make this a quadruple date . Wait , what ? What is that ?"
200,205,"This is Tom , the turkey . Please tell me we 're not eating Tom . We are not eating Tom . I did n't"
205,210,"know if this was like a Say - Hi - To - Your - Dinner thing as you arrive . We have this entire $ 50,000 island"
210,215,and everything on it to ourselves . I say the best way to kick off an island date is to
215,220,go jet skiing ! Let 's go ! Best date ever ! You might
220,225,recognize Grizz and Hase from the video where they spent 74 days in the wilderness together .
225,230,The day I took that hood off and saw you was the best day of my life ! And you saw these two
230,235,"when Josh spent 22 days in solitary confinement . These three spent weeks away from their wives ,"
235,240,so I thought I 'd give them some quality time together . This is the best date we 've ever been on ! Does the
240,245,wife approve ? I approve ! This is how I make good with all the people I put in prolonged places .
245,250,"Oh my gosh , that was so close ! Hey ,"
250,255,"Jimmy ! It ’s Nolan ! Yo ! Uh - oh , we 're"
255,260,"bouncin ' . Nolan is flying solo for this date , but later on , he 'll be going on a date with"
260,265,"Madison Beer . I , uh — the great outfit … Everyone , the island"
265,270,is all yours . Go do whatever you want ! So we all enjoyed the luxuries of this $
270,275,"50,000 island date . All right everyone , heads up ! Like hitting golf balls that are also fish food"
275,280,"right into the ocean . Thea , you show me how it ’s done . I actually do n't know how to do this ."
280,285,Now we 're getting couples ' massages on the beach .
285,290,There is just a person on my back . Very relaxing . Grizz and Hase were playing some beach
290,295,"volleyball … against their wives , of course . And Josh and Kenna were having a picnic on"
295,300,"the beach . I forgive you for taking him away from me for so long . Welcome in , guys . Oh wait , there"
300,305,"'s rose petals . I mean , I laid those just for you . For 50 grand ,"
305,310,"we all get these luxurious bungalows . Where do the petals lead ? I mean , look where the petals lead ."
310,315,Into the lovely master suite . I made a heart just for you . It is so pretty .
315,320,"And you picked them yourself ? Oh , I made this myself . Wow . And as the sun was"
320,325,"setting on this $ 50,000 date … To our loved one ! Cheers ! … Nolan was the only one at"
325,330,"dinner without a date . Until Tom the turkey showed up . Nolan , we"
330,335,"found you a partner ! Uh , I 'm all good on Tom . And after dinner , we did some couples dancing ."
335,340,Rate our dance move . Again . Got it ? Come
340,345,"on ! And after dark , we had a beach campfire ,"
345,350,and I had a surprise for everyone . Cue the fireworks show !
350,355,And lightning at the same time !
355,360,"Nolan , your date showed up ! Tom the Turkey ! Yo , why are you standin ' so still ? That 's"
360,365,"it for the $ 50,000 date ! I 'll see you guys at the next one . For double the cost of the"
365,370,"previous date , we get this massive indoor metropolis all to ourselves . There 's a"
370,375,"giant theme park , the largest indoor water park in America , even its own weather control"
375,380,"system so they can have the largest indoor ski slope in America . Ooh , it 's so cool . This is"
380,385,terrifying ! And while Thea loves skiing … I have n't told her … I have no
385,390,"idea how to ski . Babe , this is massive !"
390,395,You 're scared ? Do n’t be scared . I 'm not
395,400,"scared . Nah . You 're good . Hey , what 's over there ? What ? I 'm freakin ' terrified . What did you say ? I"
400,405,"'m excited ! Ok , you got it ? Babe , grab the straight —"
405,410,"Babe , stop ! How do I stop ?"
410,415,"Babe , I 'm starting to think that you do n't know how to ski . No , I — I know how to ski . How do I"
415,420,"stand up ? I got you . Ah ! Oh , no . Babe , stop ! Babe , help ! Thea ,"
420,425,make me stop . Ok . I got you .
425,430,How do I stop ? Legs together ! Legs
430,435,"closed , legs closed ! What , are they not closed ?"
435,440,"Yeah , skiing is so much fun . Anyways , let 's move on with the date ! With so much"
440,445,"to explore in this shopping metropolis , it felt like doing ten dates in one ! From"
445,450,winning prizes in an arcade … … getting a hole - in - one in mini golf … Look at that !
450,455,Yeah ! … or building each other custom teddy bears . I love it . And where I normally do these
455,460,"kinds of videos by myself or with my friends , doing this with the person I love most was"
460,465,kind of magical . Being able to do pretty
465,470,much anything you could ever want to do on a date — It felt like being a kid in a candy store …
470,475,"literally ! Ooh , chocolate . Whoa . What is this ? Uh . Hey ,"
475,480,ma'am ? What is this ? They 're Hershey 's .
480,485,Can we replace these with Feastables ?
485,490,"Sure . Ok . Oh ! Much better ! If you have n’t already , try Feastables . It 's the"
490,495,best - tasting chocolate on the planet . Let 's keep the date going . We now have an entire waterpark to
495,500,"ourselves , and we just wanna take a relaxing swim together . Is n't"
500,505,"it crazy that we 're in the middle of a mall ? It 's like as big as the ocean . Up next , we actually got"
505,510,Madison Beer to go on a date with Nolan . Do you think Nolan has a chance with her ?
510,515,"We 're about to find out . For the $ 250,000 date ,"
515,520,"Madison Beer , the two - time Grammy nominee , platinum - selling artist , with"
520,525,"over 3.5 billion streams worldwide , is going on a date with … my"
525,530,awkward friend Nolan . Hello ! Hey . Great to
530,535,"meet you . How are you ? Nice to meet you . And while Nolan is on his date with Madison Beer ,"
535,540,me and Tareq are currently tucked away in the bathroom with a walkie that communicates directly to a mic in
540,545,Nolan 's ear . Where are you from ? I 'm from Long Island . New York ? Yes . Where are you from ? Nebraska . Not
545,550,"much out there besides corn . Cool . Yeah . No ,"
550,555,"he 's talking about corn ! In this seven years I 've known Nolan , I have never seen him this nervous"
555,560,"before . So to help Nolan out , I spent $ 250,000 on Madison 's dream"
560,565,"date . From driving her favorite car , getting VIP treatment at an MLB game , and an"
565,570,"over - the - top sushi dinner , all to give Nolan the best shot of securing a second date ."
570,575,Tell her you like her outfit . A great outfit .
575,580,Thank you . We told the waiter to help us wingman Nolan . I 'll be your server . Welcome to Bar Siesta .
580,585,"You guys look amazing . I like your shoes my man . Dude , thank you . But it was quickly clear that it was n't working . How 's the"
585,590,weather ? How 's the weather ? Cool . He ’s falling apart . Nolan is not used to talking to
590,595,attractive women . You 've watched the videos before ? I watch all the videos . What 's your favorite video ? The one where they were
595,600,underground for 100 days . Madison Beer watches our videos . I never expected that . Same .
600,605,"I do n't really eat meat . Vegan ? Vegetarian ? Pescatarian , 'cause I love sushi . They 're getting to know each"
605,610,"other , this is nice . Sorry , I just got lost in your eyes . Aw , that 's so sweet . Ohh , he hit it ! He took"
610,615,"the shot ! I was staring into the abyss . I do n't … Oh , not my eyes ? No ."
615,620,"As they finished eating , I had one last idea to help Nolan . I want you to tip the waiter $ 10,000 ."
620,625,"My card is in your wallet . That guy was so nice . I think we should tip $ 10,000 . I would"
625,630,"love nothing more . Nolan has a gift for you . We left a little something for you . Wait , are you guys"
630,635,serious ? Thank you . I appreciate it . Here are the keys . Thank you . Let 's hit it .
635,640,"Madison really loves animals , so their next stop on their date is an animal farm . Nolan 's only"
640,645,problem now was that the petting zoo was an hour drive away .
645,650,Me and Tareq are still listening in . What 's it like going
650,655,up in front of thousands and thousands of people ? I just love my fans . They 're the reason I get to
655,660,do stuff like this and live my dreams . He 's warming up and he 's getting better with time . We made it to the second
660,665,"part of the date . The Gentle Barn , a sanctuary that rescues abused animals . What made you start loving"
665,670,"animals so much ? I have a lot of anxiety , and I feel like they just are a calming reminder of peace . I feel a"
670,675,sense of calm around you . You are smooth with it . But visiting animals was n't the only thing on our
675,680,"agenda . They 're gon na give you guys $ 25,000 , and I 'm actually going to match them , and I ’m gon na"
680,685,"give you another 25,000 . And then it was time for me to ask an important question . You two ready to head to an Angels"
685,690,baseball game ? Let 's do it . Sure am . Do you mind if me and my fiancee join you guys for the next part of the
690,695,"date ? Am I allowed to say no ? No , 'cause I paid for it . I mean , you paid for it , right ? And then we had an"
695,700,entire suite to ourselves at an Angels game . This view of the game is insane . We got custom
700,705,jerseys with our names on the back . And after almost all of us made it on the jumbotron …
705,710,"a crowd began forming around us . You 'll be in a video , say "" Hi . """
710,715,"Anyways , we should probably head to the next part of this date . And"
715,720,"for the final part of the $ 250,000 date — What are we doing , Nolan ? Sushi dinner and an ice skating"
720,725,rink with some of the best sushi chefs on the earth . I can definitely say I 've never done
725,730,"anything like this . I gotcha , I gotcha . Thank you , Jimmy ."
730,735,Tonight we prepared for you all a tasting menu . How much does this amount of fish cost ? A couple thousand . How do you think
735,740,we got up to the 250 K price tag ? Definitely looks like my type of bite of sushi . Oh my God .
740,745,That is so good . Wow . And then we all enjoyed some of the best sushi I 've
745,750,"ever had in my entire life . This is the best date ever . Thanks , Nolan . Anytime ."
750,755,"The 250 K date , I think we could all agree , was a lot of fun . Nolan , you had a question you wanted to ask . I"
755,760,"do . Oh , God ."
760,765,"Oh , Jesus . Oh , God . My shoe"
765,770,was just untied . Would you like to go on a second date to
770,775,Disneyland with me ? Yes . Let 's head on over !
775,780,And now it is time for the most expensive grand finale date . We have Disneyland
780,785,all to ourselves ! This is gon na be awesome . Let 's go ride some rides ! Disney
785,790,"wo n't just hand over their keys to anyone , but for this once - in - a - lifetime date , we were given"
790,795,"the entire park for one night . And with so much to do , we had to bring the boys , our friends"
795,800,"from the island , and of course … Madison and Nolan . Yo , once we ’re at the top , this is gon na"
800,805,have a crazy view . But our first stop is this absolutely
805,810,"insane Star Wars ride . All right , that 's cool . Holy smokes ! Look how"
810,815,"big this is ! Normally , people can wait hours for this ride , but my friends and I walked right in ."
815,820,"Yo , strap in . All right , who 's ready for the Star Wars ride ?"
820,825,Is now a bad time to mention I have n't seen the movies ? What ?
825,830,This is crazy ! How did Disney build all this ? This is wild . Oh my Gosh .
830,835,"Nolan , protect Madison ! Yo , can you believe we 're doing this right now ?"
835,840,"Yeah , this is insane !"
840,845,That was awesome . Once in a lifetime ! This is crazy ! That was amazing ! Every other cart was empty . We have
845,850,"this whole place to ourselves . Disneyland is awesome ! That was sick ! And after that ride , what could"
850,855,"be cooler … … than building your own lightsaber ? Oh , yeah ! Coolest"
855,860,lightsaber !
860,865,"Up next , we 're all gon na ride this giant Ferris Wheel . We 're back to where this video started . You"
865,870,could say it went full circle . I 've never been on a Ferris Wheel that
870,875,"looks like that ! Yeah , this is massive ! It feels like we 're stepping into an old movie ."
875,880,"Come on in , babe . This is like the $ 1 date , but in"
880,885,Disneyland and much bigger . Much bigger ! You can see the entire park up here . Wow ! How does
