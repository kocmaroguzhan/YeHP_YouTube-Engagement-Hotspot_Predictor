00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.901
- I got 100 of my subscribers

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:04.104
and gave them each $10,000.

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:07.007
And I also rented one of the
largest malls in the world

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.475
and locked them inside.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.511
And for the next 10 hours,
I'm gonna hunt them down.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.345
Run!

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.179
Get outta here!

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
Skedaddle!

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.649
If I find them, I take my $10,000 back.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.918
If they survive until
morning, they keep it.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.186
- I've never been in this mall.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.755
- This place is massive.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:22.589
- Let's go!

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.656
- Oh my God, yes!

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.892
- No, one's gonna find me here.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:27.327
- No way!

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.295
Can we put this in our pockets right now?

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.964
- I know I saw someone at Lego Land,

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.565
so me and the boys are gonna check it out.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.400
- This is ridiculous.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.534
- Whoa, this is actually crazy.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.703
- I know for a fact
someone is in this room.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:37.537
- Isn't it funny

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.806
that there's probably
gonna be somebody here?

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.307
Let's go this way.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.077
- Come on!

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.278
- Wait, you found someone up there?

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.312
- Yo, my parents literally told me

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:47.414
not to be the first person out.

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:49.182
- The first person has
officially been found,

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.452
and he has now transformed
into a mannequin.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.888
One down, 99 more to go.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:55.722
We need to spread out,

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.323
so I sent Chandler and Karl to Toys R Us

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.858
while I checked out the ice rink.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.126
This mall literally has everything.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.029
This vending machine is
suspiciously far off the wall.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:05.932
Oh.

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.167
Why is this vending machine like this?

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.001
There's a ladder.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.070
If they climbed up that
ladder into the ceiling,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.337
they deserve to win 10 grand.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.339
- I'm feeling there's
people at this Toys R Us.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.507
Did you see people here?

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:15.341
Do you know?

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.209
- I don't know.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.043
- Yeah, right!

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.711
Are you even hiding?

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.214
Is there anybody else in the Toys R Us?

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.048
- Yes.

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:22.882
- Oh, his morals are shot!

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.918
- Someone's definitely
behind these curtains.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.054
Oh, snap!

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.889
Yo, I was not expecting the first one.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:30.957
- Oh my gosh.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.125
- There's no one else over here?

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.426
Here, hold one second.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.260
See his face?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.896
Yeah, there's someone else here.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.133
Oh, I see another blue shirt.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.101
- I can't.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.936
- I just saved another $20,000.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.704
I'm sorry for ruining your dreams.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:45.772
- It's fine.
- It's fine.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:46.739
- Oh.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:47.674
No!

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.008
- Are you the only one here?

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:49.843
- Yes.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:50.677
- Well, you just lied to me

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:51.511
'cause there's somebody right here.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.213
- What a good guy.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.314
- Oh no.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:56.349
- I hate you so much, not you so much,

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:57.684
but I hate you so much.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:58.885
- I'm a super broke college student.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.887
This money would actually change my life.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.789
- 10 grand would definitely mean a lot

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.125
for, not only me, but for my family.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.359
- We've been searching for three hours,

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.394
and I've only found seven people.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.797
So, I need some backup.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.532
I called in Sapnap and Marques.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.334
Guys, I need you to search this ski resort

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.301
'cause I don't have time for it.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.236
- Hello?

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:17.704
Ah, found 'em.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.539
Another one.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.241
Oh!
- Oh God!

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.842
- There's a person there!
- There's someone?

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.544
Oh my God, how did you get in there?

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:25.612
I found the person.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:26.613
- Oh, you made a little fort.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.915
- That was a genuinely
good idea, but we got it.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.316
- Nolan's checking the trashcans,

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.485
Sapnap and Marques Brownlee
are checking the ski resort.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.921
I wonder how Karl and Chandler are doing?

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:39.025
- We are gonna check every
single water slide here twice.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.228
- I don't see anybody in there.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.832
- I didn't see anybody in there.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:46.666
We're gonna check.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.500
We're looking.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.169
- We'll check this slide.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.037
- Wait, guys, there's nobody up here.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:51.871
- Hello?

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:52.705
- Yo, you called?

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.073
- Yeah, I was curious what you're up to?

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:55.275
- We're at the water park.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.109
- I trust you.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.810
Just try to find more people, okay?

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.645
- Should we check?

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.380
- They're not even allowed to be in there.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.481
- But what if they're cheating?

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.683
- That's fair.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:04.651
- No way.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:05.718
No way.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.320
Now we're allowed to go on the slide!

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.254
- Yeah!

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:09.088
- Getting out of Toys R Us.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:12.692
Apparently they were
coming into Toys R Us.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:14.761
- I see you!

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:15.728
What's your number?

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.838
Hey, where are you, sneaky?

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:29.075
You're not gonna pull a fast one on Nolan!

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.910
- While the contestant
was running from Nolan,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.846
he actually ran straight
into Chandler and Karl.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.215
- Look, he's running away!

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.049
- What?

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.184
He's lucky my feet are wet,
and I don't have shoes on.

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:39.152
I'm catching you.

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.821
- Around the corner!

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:45.291
- No!

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.627
- You're fast.

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:48.962
- With just under six hours left,

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.464
we had 78 people left to find.

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.767
- We should go find people.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:57.937
There's a briefcase right there.

00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:01.374
That means there's somebody nearby.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:02.208
- Are you awake?

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.042
- She's asleep.

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:05.111
- Hello?

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.045
Yeah, but we found you.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:06.879
Good morning.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.714
- No, you didn't.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:08.548
- What is this, Tareq?

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:09.382
- A panda.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.216
- A hiding spot.

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:12.018
If you're in this pile of
ginormous stuffed animals,

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:13.319
you're gonna get found.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.654
See that zebra blanket right there?

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.556
That's oddly stretched out
in the shape of a human.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:17.991
Let's see if I just made 10 grand.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:20.393
- I think I scared you.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.628
- No, but that would've been embarrassing

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:22.462
if you weren't there.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:24.197
- Ya boy's exhausted.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.000
No way you're back there.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.335
- Yo, we have a little guest.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.270
That's crazy.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.104
Good luck to you.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.072
- Thank you, you too.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.040
- Yeah, let me get a putter.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.241
- Chandler, what are you doing?

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:36.442
You don't work here.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.277
- Relax.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.244
- What are you guys doing?

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:39.312
We're supposed to be looking.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.280
- We're looking, man.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.848
And you have to stop undermining the fact

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:42.815
that we're looking.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.551
- I don't know where he is, so...

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.957
They are playing mini golf right outside.

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:55.495
- Howdy.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:57.230
- They caught someone
right outside the box.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.197
- Experience is what it's all about,

00:04:58.197 --> 00:04:59.999
and I'm glad you guys
got to play putt-putt

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.167
while making me lose.

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:03.703
- We've caught 37 people so far,

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:04.671
which might sound great,

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:07.740
but I still have $630,000 on the line.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.442
I think I might need some backup.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.412
At exactly 5:00 AM I scheduled
a SWAT team to show up.

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:15.415
Believe it or not, there's
an entire theme park in here.

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:16.949
We haven't even searched it yet.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.051
Does this not look cool?

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.652
Here's the twist I haven't told them yet.

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:20.987
Every person you guys find,

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.422
I'll let you keep half the money.

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:23.289
- Yes, sir.

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.123
- They're so serious.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:24.957
What's the plan?

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:25.792
Do your thing.

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:26.626
- You two back there.

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:28.728
Us three, we're just gonna
circle around the whole mall.

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:31.130
- 7752, make sure the area's
clear before we leave it.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.801
- Someone under the stairs by the exit.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:35.635
- What?

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:36.469
No way.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.838
- They are scanning this place like crazy.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.541
- 77, check behind the
escalators to your nine.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.676
- So, you're currently
operating a thermal drone,

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.044
and then calling it out to your people.

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:47.046
- Hey, we got two behind by the brown mat.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.981
- Oh my gosh, there was a drone.

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:50.316
- Wait, is that someone hiding?

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:51.150
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.984
Come on, we're out.

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:52.885
- How long have you been under there?

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:53.720
- The whole time.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.554
- The whole time?

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:57.156
- There's a drone flying
literally right above my head.

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:57.990
- All clear.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.825
- Oh my God.

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:00.259
How long have you been back there?

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.461
- About five hours.

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.295
Tired.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.830
- Not gonna get away money on our watch.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.431
- This SWAT team does not mess around.

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:07.633
Oh my God, bro, look at how
many people they're finding.

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.435
He's carrying that like it weighs nothing.

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:10.903
You all managed to find 10 people

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.972
faster than I found like two.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:14.874
As promised, you guys
can take half of 'em.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:15.708
- Are you for real?

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:16.542
- Yeah.

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:17.377
- Thank you.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.678
- Actually, here, take this one as well.

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:19.812
You each to get a clean
briefcase of 10 grand.

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:20.646
Thank you!

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:21.481
- Thank you.

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:22.315
- Appreciate it.

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:24.217
- SWAT team that crushed my dreams.

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.184
- And now that that's done,

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.220
this entire theme park has to be empty.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.421
- Somehow they missed me.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.890
I guess the drone didn't see me.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.325
- And now they're mannequins.

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:33.526
The hunt continues.

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:36.095
Even with the SWAT team, we
have too much area to search.

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:38.364
We've gotta get some
contestants out in the open.

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:40.566
And to do it, I called upon
our friend, Jack Black.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.269
This is gonna play over every
speaker in the entire mall.

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.004
- Jimmy's closing the water park.

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.472
You guys better find a new place to hide

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:47.807
if you want that money.

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:48.641
- Thank you, Jack Black.

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:49.742
- I love him so much.

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.811
- He just said that they
closed down the water park.

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:55.114
I have to go down all these flights

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:58.351
- I'm going to keep hiding
here 'til the end of the night.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:01.287
- My next mission right now
is gonna be to go to pee.

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:02.722
I hope I survive?

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.357
- Gonna try to go under
the stage right now.

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:06.459
I don't think he'll be
able to catch us there.

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:10.696
Alrighty.

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:12.098
Made it under the stage, guys.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.300
I think we'll be good here
for the rest of the night.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.134
- I'm not kidding,

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:16.803
there was just somebody
there and now they're gone.

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:17.870
Tareq, give me your camera.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.273
- Okay, there you go.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.543
- There was just...

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:24.610
- You just saw somebody?

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.445
- Yes!

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.412
I was yelling at you to get over here.

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:27.613
- I don't see anyone.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:28.714
I think we're good.

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:29.782
- It is 7:00 AM.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:32.318
I knew as time went on, the
boys would get less motivated.

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:33.786
There are 53 people remaining.

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:35.288
And if you guys help me get it under 30,

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.624
I'll buy all your moms a boat.

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:39.892
- My mom likes boats!

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:41.227
- Here's how the math works out.

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:43.896
You get me under 30, I save 230 grand.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:46.299
I can find a nice boat for 15 grand a pop.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.834
That equals savings in my pocket.

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:49.502
It should be smooth sailing for the boys.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:50.970
- I see what he did there.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.313
- I believe I've sniffed out my prey.

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:03.583
Are you kidding?

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.051
I was positive.

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.886
There's no way nobody's

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.087
I see you!

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.655
I was almost about to leave.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.390
- You almost kept going.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.325
- If it means anything,

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.861
my mom's one step closer
to winning a boat.

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:15.828
- Your mom?

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.763
- Turns out the boats
were a good motivation

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:20.132
because the boys started
finding a ton of people.

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:20.967
- Oh no!

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.007
- We're down to just over two hours left.

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.709
The contestants have to be getting tired.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:30.910
- I'm beyond delirious,

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.779
but I think I've totally outsmarted Jimmy.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:35.081
- All right, Nolan, what's going on?

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:35.915
What are you doing, dude?

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:36.849
- I'm becoming an old man.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:39.118
And I'm gonna go become a janitor.

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:42.455
Back in my day

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:48.027
I think I heard something
in the candy store.

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.595
I found my t-shirt.

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:51.864
Have you seen anybody
with a blue jumpsuit?

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:52.965
- I'm trying to think.

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:54.600
- Feel like you're lying to me, son.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.935
- I would never.

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:58.304
- Jimmy said he already looked here,

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.773
but Jimmy's not good at it, so...

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:01.841
Oh no!

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:02.808
Dude, immediately.

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.143
Jimmy, you already looked here?

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:04.977
- Oh my gosh.

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:06.445
Remember, if you win your mom a boat,

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.214
you also win Sapnap's mom a boat.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.116
- I wanna give Sapnap's mom everything.

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:11.117
- All right.

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:14.420
- Grandpa's mad.

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:19.559
You've been found by the old man.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.526
What were you doing?

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:21.994
- I gotta go to pee.

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.563
- You were going to the bathroom?

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.397
- Yeah.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.865
- Well, this is awkward.

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:26.832
- The search goes on.

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:30.102
- You're not lying to
me, no one's in here?

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:31.404
All right, I know what I need to know.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.072
Scan the area, boys.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.308
- Oh!

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:36.142
- I knew it!

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.376
- Now is there someone in here?

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:38.210
- No.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.045
That's it.

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:39.879
- I believe him.

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:40.846
And if you count up the
mannequins back here,

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:43.950
there's over 70, which means
you guys hit your goal.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.653
All your moms just won a brand new boat.

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:48.487
- You're welcome, Mom.

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:50.823
- Karl, I think my girlfriend
could really use a new shirt.

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:53.559
- I'm gonna be honest, your
girlfriend looks good in red.

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.127
- Karl, what do you think
about this shirt right here?

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:56.329
I don't remember what size she is.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:57.663
Maybe we should buy all of 'em.

00:09:57.663 --> 00:09:58.497
Here.

00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:00.700
What about these Charleston Chews?

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.534
- Yeah.

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:02.501
And the shelf.

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:03.336
Maybe not the shelf.

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:04.537
- No, I want the shelf.

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:05.371
You know what?

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:06.339
I don't want the shelf.

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:07.173
You know what, Karl?

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:09.742
I think my girlfriend also
would want an It'Sugar box.

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.844
Let me just grab it real quick.

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:12.912
- Oh my God.

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:14.013
- Yeah, you really almost won.

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:14.847
- Love to hear that.

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:15.681
- You can do your thing.

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:16.515
I just need this.

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:17.483
With only 30 minutes left,

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:19.452
the mall actually opened to the public,

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.421
and I still have $230,000 left to recover.

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:24.857
Do you wanna be in the video?

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:27.059
You see any people in blue jumpsuits?

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:27.893
- Not yet.

00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:28.728
- Ah, darn

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.329
- Dude, look at, I don't
care if I've looked there,

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:31.163
just keep looking.

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:31.998
Are there two people in here?

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:32.832
- Yes.

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:33.899
- If you hand them to me right now,

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:35.735
you get to keep one of the briefcases.

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:37.536
- That means you're stealing
it from somebody else.

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:38.604
- Don't do it!

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:40.840
This is going on the internet!

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.908
- There's only 15 minutes left.

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:45.478
- 15 minutes left, and I walk away 10K.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:46.445
- Nothing can stop me.

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:47.246
I'm ready.

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.681
I'm winning this.

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:51.684
- Wait, what did I just see?

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:52.518
Wait.

00:10:52.518 --> 00:10:53.352
Here, come over here.

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:54.720
Since there's literally
less than 20 minutes,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.423
I'm gonna act like I can't
see, so you might wanna run.

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:59.258
I'd feel terrible taking
$10,000 from those guys

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:01.727
in the literal last 15
minutes of the challenge.

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:04.930
- We are in the final 10
minutes of this challenge.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:05.765
- So tired.

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:08.768
- The home stretch is finally here.

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:10.503
- The challenge does end in five minutes.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:11.704
- I'm not gonna do it.

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:12.538
- For 10 grand?

00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:13.372
- 10 grand.

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:14.206
Not gonna do it.

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:15.041
- Wow.

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:16.409
- The last four minutes of this challenge,

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:18.744
hopefully there's no
twist and turns again.

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:22.615
- I'd cry real tears if I
get eliminated at this point.

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.116
- Three, two, one.

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:29.722
Contestants, the timer
has finally hit zero.

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:30.656
- It's done, it's done, it's done.

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:31.490
- What?

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.292
- Jimmy, called the contestants.

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:34.527
- I just found...

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.361
Bro, wait.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:38.497
- If you are still in, that
means you won $10,000 in cash.

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:41.067
- You lasted one second extra.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:41.901
You won.

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:42.735
- I know.

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:45.071
I'm literally listening to them.

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:46.005
- Oh my God!

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:48.340
My kids are gonna have a real vacation.

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:53.245
- Congratulations on all you surviving.

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:55.414
They each just won $10,000 in cash.

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:57.183
On top of all the other
money we gave away,

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:58.651
I had a million dollars at risk,

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:00.386
and I think I ended up only
spending half a million

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.487
which I can live with.
