110,115,"Well , you just lied to me 'cause there 's somebody right here . What a good guy . Oh no . I hate you"
115,120,"so much , not you so much , but I hate you so much . I 'm a super broke college student . This money would"

170,175,"there 's nobody up here . Hello ? Yo , you called ? Yeah , I was curious what you 're up to ? We 're at the"
175,180,"water park . I trust you . Just try to find more people , okay ? Should we check ? They 're not even allowed to"
180,185,be in there . But what if they 're cheating ? That 's fair . No way .
185,190,No way . Now we 're allowed to go on the slide ! Yeah ! Getting out of Toys R Us .
190,195,Apparently they were coming into Toys R Us . I see you !
195,200,What 's your number ?
200,205,"Hey , where"
205,210,"are you , sneaky ? You 're not gon na pull a fast one on Nolan ! While the contestant"
210,215,"was running from Nolan , he actually ran straight into Chandler and Karl . Look , he 's running"
215,220,"away ! What ? He 's lucky my feet are wet , and I do n't have shoes on . I 'm catching you ."
220,225,Around the corner !
225,230,"No ! You 're fast . With just under six hours left , we had 78"
230,235,people left to find . We should go find people .
235,240,There 's a briefcase right there . That means there 's
240,245,somebody nearby . Are you awake ? She 's asleep .
245,250,"Hello ? Yeah , but we found you . Good morning . No , you did n't . What is this , Tareq ? A panda . A hiding"
250,255,"spot . If you 're in this pile of ginormous stuffed animals , you 're gon na get found . See that zebra blanket right there ? That 's"
255,260,oddly stretched out in the shape of a human . Let 's see if I just made 10 grand . I think I
260,265,"scared you . No , but that would 've been embarrassing if you were n't there . Ya boy 's exhausted ."
265,270,"No way you 're back there . Yo , we have a little guest . That 's"
270,275,"crazy . Good luck to you . Thank you , you too . Yeah , let me get a putter . Chandler , what are you"
275,280,doing ? You do n't work here . Relax . What are you guys doing ? We 're supposed to be looking . We 're
280,285,"looking , man . And you have to stop undermining the fact that we 're looking . I do n't know where"
285,290,"he is , so ... They are playing mini golf"
290,295,right outside .
295,300,"Howdy . They caught someone right outside the box . Experience is what it 's all about , and I 'm glad you guys got to play putt - putt"
300,305,"while making me lose . We 've caught 37 people so far , which might sound great , but"
305,310,"I still have $ 630,000 on the line . I think I might need some backup . At"
310,315,"exactly 5:00 AM I scheduled a SWAT team to show up . Believe it or not , there 's an entire theme"
315,320,park in here . We have n't even searched it yet . Does this not look cool ? Here 's the twist I have n't told them yet . Every
320,325,"person you guys find , I 'll let you keep half the money . Yes , sir . They 're so serious . What 's the plan ?"
325,330,"Do your thing . You two back there . Us three , we 're just gon na circle around the whole mall . 7752 , make sure the area 's"
330,335,clear before we leave it . Someone under the stairs by the exit .
335,340,"What ? No way . They are scanning this place like crazy . 77 , check behind"
340,345,"the escalators to your nine . So , you 're currently operating a thermal drone , and then calling it out to your"
345,350,"people . Hey , we got two behind by the brown mat . Oh my gosh , there was a drone . Wait , is that someone"
350,355,"hiding ? Come on , let 's go , let 's go . Come on , we 're out . How long have you been under there ? The whole time . The whole time ? There 's"
355,360,a drone flying literally right above my head . All clear . Oh my God . How long have you been back
360,365,there ? About five hours . Tired . Not gon na get away money on our watch . This SWAT team does not
365,370,"mess around . Oh my God , bro , look at how many people they 're finding . He 's carrying that like it weighs nothing . You all"
370,375,"managed to find 10 people faster than I found like two . As promised , you guys can take half of 'em ."
375,380,"Are you for real ? Yeah . Thank you . Actually , here , take this one as well . You each to get a clean briefcase of 10 grand ."
380,385,Thank you ! Thank you . Appreciate it . SWAT team that crushed my dreams . And now that that 's
385,390,"done , this entire theme park has to be empty . Somehow they missed me . I guess the drone"
390,395,"did n't see me . And now they 're mannequins . The hunt continues . Even with the SWAT team , we have"
395,400,"too much area to search . We 've got ta get some contestants out in the open . And to do it , I called upon our"
400,405,"friend , Jack Black . This is gon na play over every speaker in the entire mall . Jimmy 's closing the water"
405,410,"park . You guys better find a new place to hide if you want that money . Thank you , Jack Black . I love him so much . He"
410,415,just said that they closed down the water park . I have to go down all these
415,420,flights I 'm going to keep hiding here ' til the end of the night . My next mission right now
420,425,is gon na be to go to pee . I hope I survive ? Gon na try to go under the stage right now . I do n't think
425,430,he 'll be able to catch us there .
430,435,"Alrighty . Made it under the stage , guys . I think we 'll be good here for the rest of the night . I 'm not"
435,440,"kidding , there was just somebody there and now they 're gone . Tareq , give me your camera . Okay , there you"
440,445,go . There was just ... You just saw somebody ?
445,450,Yes ! I was yelling at you to get over here . I do n't see anyone . I think we 're good . It is 7:00 AM . I
450,455,"knew as time went on , the boys would get less motivated . There are 53 people remaining . And if you guys help me get it"
455,460,"under 30 , I 'll buy all your moms a boat . My mom likes boats !"
460,465,"Here 's how the math works out . You get me under 30 , I save 230 grand . I can find a nice"
465,470,boat for 15 grand a pop . That equals savings in my pocket . It should be smooth sailing for the boys . I see
470,475,what he did there .
475,480,I believe I 've sniffed out my
480,485,prey . Are you kidding ? I was
485,490,positive . There 's no way nobody 's I see you ! I was almost about to leave . You
490,495,"almost kept going . If it means anything , my mom 's one step closer to winning a boat ."
495,500,Your mom ? Turns out the boats were a good motivation because the boys started finding a ton of
500,505,people . Oh no !
505,510,We 're down to just over two hours left . The contestants have to be getting tired . I 'm
510,515,"beyond delirious , but I think I 've totally outsmarted Jimmy . All right , Nolan , what 's going"
515,520,"on ? What are you doing , dude ? I 'm becoming an old man . And I 'm gon na go become a janitor ."
520,525,Back in my day I
525,530,think I heard something in the candy store . I found my t - shirt . Have
530,535,"you seen anybody with a blue jumpsuit ? I 'm trying to think . Feel like you 're lying to me , son . I"
535,540,"would never . Jimmy said he already looked here , but Jimmy 's not"
540,545,"good at it , so ... Oh no ! Dude , immediately . Jimmy , you already looked here ? Oh my gosh ."
545,550,"Remember , if you win your mom a boat , you also win Sapnap 's mom a boat . I wanna give Sapnap 's mom"
550,555,everything . All right . Grandpa 's mad .
555,560,You 've been found by the old man . What
560,565,"were you doing ? I got ta go to pee . You were going to the bathroom ? Yeah . Well ,"
565,570,"this is awkward . The search goes on . You 're not lying to me , no one 's in"
570,575,"here ? All right , I know what I need to know . Scan the area , boys ."
575,580,Oh ! I knew it ! Now is there someone in here ? No . That 's it . I believe him . And
580,585,"if you count up the mannequins back here , there 's over 70 , which means you guys hit your goal . All your"
585,590,"moms just won a brand new boat . You 're welcome , Mom . Karl , I think my girlfriend could"
590,595,"really use a new shirt . I 'm gon na be honest , your girlfriend looks good in red . Karl , what do you think about this shirt right"
595,600,here ? I do n't remember what size she is . Maybe we should buy all of 'em . Here . What about these
600,605,"Charleston Chews ? Yeah . And the shelf . Maybe not the shelf . No , I want the shelf . You"
605,610,"know what ? I do n't want the shelf . You know what , Karl ? I think my girlfriend also would want an It'Sugar box ."
