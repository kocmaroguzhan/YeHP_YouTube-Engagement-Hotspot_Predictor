232.439,236.789,Zoolander I am now a male model I mean
236.799,241.35,kind of let me explain exactly how this
241.36,244.11,came to be so exactly a year ago a
244.12,245.39,couple nights before the New York City
245.4,247.99,marathon 2022 I realized I needed a
248.0,249.75,black shirt to run the marathon in but I
249.76,251.589,didn't have a black shirt to run the
251.599,255.39,marathon in gray blue gray blue white so
255.4,257.03,I rode my skateboard to Lululemon and I
257.04,259.27,found a black shirt a perfect black
259.28,261.909,shirt perfect and I ran the marathon in
261.919,266.189,that perfect black shirt let's go
266.199,268.55,casy now sometime after the marathon
268.56,269.87,some folks from Lululemon reached out
269.88,271.51,and they said hey we saw you wearing our
271.52,273.55,shirt we should stay in touch I said
273.56,276.59,yeah we should stay in touch about 10
276.6,278.55,months later 2 months ago they reached
278.56,280.11,out and said hey have you heard of our
280.12,281.95,ABC pants and I said have I heard of
281.96,283.79,them look at this

286.759,291.27,2017 and those are Lululemon pants in
291.28,294.909,fact they're these exact pair of
294.919,298.67,pants they're my favorite pants because
298.68,301.55,because while they're 100% as handsome
301.56,304.95,as regular pants they're 99% as
304.96,307.029,comfortable as
307.039,309.39,sweatpants and then yeah the folks at
