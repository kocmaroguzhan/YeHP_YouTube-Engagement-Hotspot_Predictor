0.0,2.31,so we got a chance to unbox the pro and
2.32,4.63,pro Max iPhone 16 but what about the
4.64,7.23,standard iPhone 16s which in some ways
7.24,9.549,seem more interesting this generation
9.559,11.43,because they have most of what the pro
11.44,13.07,and pro Max have but at a more
13.08,15.15,affordable price and arguably in colors
15.16,17.07,that people are more excited for MO is
17.08,19.029,definitely more excited for these colors
19.039,20.87,right here this one they're calling teal
20.88,21.99,maybe this one's my favorite I don't
22.0,24.23,know San Jose Sharks this is Mo's
24.24,26.23,favorite which is called ultramarine and
26.24,27.83,I think he likes it because it's called
27.84,29.71,ultramarine at least has to be part of
29.72,31.95,it obviously we have the plus and the
31.96,34.27,standard size they've rearranged the
34.28,35.91,camera layout on the back these devices
35.92,38.069,do have quite a bit of wobble because of
38.079,39.91,that camera layout I'm going to compare
39.92,41.869,the wobble to the previous generation
41.879,44.11,with the diagonal camera layout we'll do
44.12,45.99,a wobble comparison very soon I was
46.0,48.189,surprised that Apple gave the camera
48.199,50.95,control functionality to the standard
50.96,52.709,model not just the pro cuz it kind of
52.719,54.349,seems like a pro feature and a way for
54.359,56.189,them to differentiate but they know more
56.199,57.99,than I do they got all kinds of data and
58.0,59.59,market research that is a beautiful
59.6,61.229,color ultramarine yeah they have all
61.239,63.029,kinds of data to suggest where they need
63.039,65.03,to be at from a price point perspective
65.04,66.59,and which ones are going to be their hot
66.6,68.19,models and which features they should
68.2,70.149,have in there so we have camera control
70.159,71.95,on the standard iPhone this is a little
71.96,73.83,bit lighter there's no titanium here
73.84,75.67,we've got the aluminum frame finish on
75.68,77.91,the back I think it's pretty nice I mean
77.92,79.87,definitely an iPhone I'm pretty sure
79.88,82.749,that's an iPhone USBC we also got the
82.759,84.789,physical SIM tray Canadian version we
84.799,87.51,have eim buil in as well big power
87.52,89.99,switch volume rocker action button
90.0,91.71,pretty nice package starting at a lot
91.72,93.789,less than the pro model the unboxing
93.799,95.83,experience is identical as we carry on
95.84,98.389,braided USBC cable packed up in the
98.399,101.789,origami style and the good old SIM tool
101.799,104.27,unchanged for Generations now when it
104.28,107.63,comes to comparing the 15 to the 16 good
107.64,109.87,Lord they are very very similar very
109.88,112.27,very similar in form factor let's do
112.28,115.109,that wobble test that I am so curious
115.119,117.469,about in the very Corner we're okay on
117.479,120.27,the 15 as we move up the device we
120.28,122.87,increase our wobble we do get wobble in
122.88,125.789,the very oh we got a double wobble it's
125.799,127.67,it's more wobbly we get wobble here
127.68,129.79,wobble here wobble here whatever I mean
129.8,131.35,a lot of smartphones are wobbling at
131.36,132.949,this point it's a plague it's a wobble
132.959,134.949,plague of course Google cares about
134.959,136.99,these things shots fired that's up to
137.0,139.15,you to decide all right let's move on to
139.16,141.15,the teal see how it compares to the
141.16,144.43,ultramarine and this is the plus siiz
144.44,147.43,iPhone 16 standard oh I love it is it
147.44,149.71,enough to persuade Mo to change his mind
149.72,152.39,oh ultramarine versus teal teal is very
152.4,155.47,nice teal is very nice he says teal is
155.48,158.67,very nice do we have previous gen plus
158.68,161.39,we do and once again we are extremely
161.4,163.91,comparable wobble test oh wobble test
163.92,166.149,gets even worse that one wobbles if you
166.159,167.91,touch it if you try to make it wobble
167.92,169.39,but when you place it down it's no
169.4,171.11,wobble this one you place it down and it
171.12,172.63,just wobbles see what I mean it just
172.64,174.07,wobbles when you just place it on the
174.08,177.07,table 15 sits there unless you aim to
177.08,179.11,make it wobble okay I'm going nuts here
179.12,181.03,with this wobble thing but if we go
181.04,183.11,instead and compare to the new Pro
183.12,185.07,Models we can see the scale difference
185.08,189.63,there Pro Max versus iPhone 16 and pro
189.64,192.27,16 versus standard 16 you can also tell
192.28,194.71,here that the non-pro variant is
194.72,196.47,slightly thinner which is cool I mean
196.48,198.39,it's slight but it is there this episode
198.4,199.869,has been sponsored by ESR and their
199.879,202.19,brand new iPhone 16 cases so let's start
202.2,204.83,with the tough case exceed 7x military
204.84,207.229,grade protection foldable stash stand
207.239,209.869,built in designed to work with mag save
209.879,212.27,this is going to be your super rugged
212.28,213.949,option you can see the mag safe on the
213.959,216.429,back and we have a multi-layer setup we
216.439,218.229,have coverage on the power port and of
218.239,219.91,course we've also got access for camera
219.92,221.47,control now so this is what's called the
221.48,224.11,foldable stash stand and this obviously
224.12,226.11,allows you to have a better viewing
226.12,229.589,experience hybrid case with stash stand
229.599,232.91,clear color Halo lock magnetic case
232.92,235.429,stash stand still get that functionality
235.439,238.55,like that slightly less of a tank than
238.56,241.589,the tough case but arguably more stylish
241.599,243.949,I also notice that the stand changes
243.959,246.71,color from a darker metallic to a silver
246.72,248.309,so next up we have the soft case
248.319,250.789,satisfying texture very soft still got
250.799,252.83,our mag safe built in still have access
252.84,255.99,to our camera control a microfiber soft
256.0,258.349,touch interior they're actually stating
258.359,260.31,that this one is 3x military grade
260.32,262.31,protection as well so similar protection
262.32,264.629,level to the hybrid the other thing
264.639,266.51,about the stand is you can pick uh
266.52,269.51,between a number of angles depending on
269.52,271.749,what what's ideal and then last up we
271.759,273.59,have their new Ultra tempered glass
273.6,276.11,screen protectors with their included
276.12,278.43,applicator you simply drop it into this
278.44,280.189,jig pull the tab and the screen
280.199,282.59,protector is installed perfectly so let
282.6,283.71,me know down in the comments if you're
283.72,285.67,going to pick up one of these new cases
285.68,287.909,for your new iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max
287.919,290.15,which go for the tough the hybrid or the
290.16,292.31,soft okay so I got them both booted up
292.32,294.87,now I have to admit that just handling
294.88,297.79,the devices the regular iPhone 16 is the
297.8,300.11,most comfortable to hold one hand
300.12,302.87,two-handed it's the thinnest lightest so
302.88,305.11,I'm not too surprised by that now let's
305.12,306.67,talk a little bit about the differences
306.68,309.189,between the 16 and the 15 the display
309.199,311.749,it's identical we now have the action
311.759,313.909,button where the switch used to be so we
313.919,316.469,get to feel like we bought the pro model
316.479,318.189,even though we didn't that's good apple
318.199,320.99,Intelligence coming soon don't call it
321.0,322.469,AI unless you're going to say the whole
322.479,324.51,thing Apple intelligence they invented
324.52,325.909,it you didn't know it was never
325.919,327.35,artificial it was always Apple
327.36,329.469,intelligence the most intelligent oh we
329.479,331.35,got the camera control functionality now
331.36,333.15,that wasn't on the previous generation
333.16,335.309,it's now capable of macro on that same
335.319,338.189,camera spatial photos and videos and
338.199,340.629,you're getting the latest generation
340.639,342.67,photographic styles that come with that
342.68,344.909,a18 chip how about I give you a little
344.919,347.469,improved battery life to the tune of 2
347.479,349.27,hours mag safe wireless charging has
349.28,351.189,improved it's faster now this is looking
351.199,353.43,a lot like the pro spec sheet except you
353.44,354.749,don't have to pay as much I think a lot
354.759,355.67,of people are just going to go with this
355.68,357.39,one maybe not this color because Mo and
357.4,359.15,I both agree that in person I think he
359.16,361.55,used the term radioactive which is maybe
361.56,362.909,a little extreme there something off
362.919,364.83,about this color in person I don't know
364.84,366.629,to each their own but the more I look at
366.639,368.95,it the more I'm like teal and I say it
368.96,371.71,in that exact voice I go like this I go
371.72,375.67,teal 128 GB teal they're like sir what
375.68,378.469,is the matter with you ay one nit
378.479,379.87,minimum brightness it is like I'm
379.88,381.67,reading the pro spec sheet here
381.68,383.71,cinematic video stabilization why do you
383.72,385.23,have to buy the pro model why you got to
385.24,387.07,buy huh to get an extra camera I guess
387.08,389.11,and to get your titanium bro your
389.12,392.629,phone's not even titanium so bro your
392.639,394.79,phone's not even titanium so what are we
394.8,396.589,doing what are we doing your phone's not
396.599,398.95,even titanium so what do we do so
398.96,400.909,everybody knows that guy everybody knows
400.919,402.67,that guy you've met that guy before
402.68,404.07,listen this is the phone you should get
404.08,406.07,just get the iPhone 16 that's my verdict
406.08,407.629,this year if you have to get an iPhone
407.639,410.029,this year Lam yeah why you need the pro
410.039,411.909,model mo why you yelling about the pro
411.919,414.55,model pro model this PR model that okay
414.56,416.11,the wide doesn't look the ultra wide
416.12,417.749,maybe doesn't look quite as good these
417.759,418.95,ones look good though look at those look
418.96,421.83,at the regular standard focal length 1X
421.84,423.23,that's kind of what you're lacking there
423.24,425.309,your Ultra y doesn't look quite as good
425.319,426.629,it's tough on these screens like it just
426.639,428.35,look at the roof the sharp like it's
428.36,429.71,it's just obvious there's just too much
429.72,431.589,resolution on the other one I presume
431.599,434.589,that on video we're going to be 4K 60 we
434.599,439.51,got the same chip right 4K 60 and no 4K
439.52,442.07,120 cuz otherwise what is pro that's
442.08,445.23,okay here is a video sample 4K 60 and mo
445.24,449.029,changed his Jersey New Jersey New Jersey
449.039,450.189,New Jersey
450.199,453.83,oh there we go modeling Mo the model
453.84,460.67,this one is here he goes oh here we go
460.68,466.469,yeah damn dude sound good e
466.479,474.629,jeez you didn't have to do them like
474.639,478.029,that titanium bro we quickly get in the
478.039,480.79,camera bam we're in you can pause videos
480.8,482.149,now I don't know if you knew about that
482.159,483.869,you can like pause a video recording
483.879,485.589,it's a new feature it's very useful I
485.599,487.309,use that feature I'm happy about it
487.319,489.79,continue the recording sounds see what
489.8,491.869,kind of sounds fine sounds
491.879,494.51,loud the I'll pinch for you this looks a
494.52,496.83,lot different than right in there for
496.84,500.11,you way lighter it has want yeah I think
500.12,501.909,this year maybe more than ever or more
501.919,503.67,than I can remember in recent I'm sure
503.68,505.27,other people probably said this and you
505.28,506.99,probably watch those videos too this
507.0,508.629,year I mean you probably don't really
508.639,511.11,need the pro model unless money is no
511.12,512.99,problemo and you're just give me the
513.0,515.63,Desert Storm I know it's desert Titan
515.64,517.87,sounds funnier if I say Desert Storm you
517.88,519.029,understand and it should have been more
519.039,521.149,Desert Storm color in my opinion when I
521.159,523.389,had the mockup Desert Storm man look at
523.399,525.35,that this is what I wanted instead we
525.36,527.91,got that like another like white phone
527.92,530.87,basically nah anyway this is the entry
530.88,532.79,point and it has the vast majority of
532.8,533.949,what you're going to end up using and
533.959,536.31,liking on the other devices yeah if you
536.32,538.15,can't see yourself needing those Studio
538.16,540.55,audio features the extra extra camera 4K
540.56,542.67,120 bigger battery obviously bigger
542.68,544.75,screen like if those things are not
544.76,546.35,absolutely major to you you can save
546.36,548.23,your money this year and you can get the
548.24,550.23,iPhone 16 or you can save even more
550.24,552.03,money and wait until the next Generation
552.04,553.19,it's completely up to you you know what
553.2,554.75,I mean it's 2024 like you know if you
554.76,556.23,need a new phone or not I think we're
556.24,557.79,past just buying these things every
557.8,559.91,single generation because we have to and
559.92,561.19,the iPhone always represents an
561.2,562.87,opportunity to speak to the audience on
562.88,564.87,that topic of like how often should we
564.88,566.75,be buying and upgrading things it's just
566.76,568.71,this phone is like the marker it's like
568.72,570.99,the test it's like the economic test of
571.0,572.59,like hey where are we at where's the
572.6,574.35,disposable income but then also it's
574.36,575.509,like hey where are we at from a
575.519,577.47,technology perspective like have things
577.48,579.11,in this segment kind of slowed down a
579.12,581.069,little bit like are we seeing as many
581.079,582.91,massive improvements are people feeling
582.92,584.509,as compelled these are the conversations
584.519,586.31,I have in public in public like in the
586.32,588.75,world and I suppose now in public here
588.76,590.509,on the internet which is also somewhere
590.519,592.19,in the
592.2,596.48,world good night
