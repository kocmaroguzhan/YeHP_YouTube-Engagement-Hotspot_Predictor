0.08,2.19,I am speed running from bronze to Unreal
2.2,4.03,last season I spent over 100 hours
4.04,6.789,getting unreal without moving 308 games
6.799,9.23,now my goal is 10 hours world record
9.24,11.19,time I've hired three of Australia's
11.2,13.39,best players Alex worthy and Luda they
13.4,15.91,have 10 fncs championships between them
15.92,18.269,I will not be leaving this setup until I
18.279,20.189,have unreal we are currently unranked
20.199,22.39,let's go see what rank we
22.4,24.99,get start the timer all right we're
25.0,27.55,dropping here I am terrified these boys
27.56,29.55,have decided we're dropping Grim gate
29.56,31.349,every single game they want to kill the
31.359,33.35,boss get the Mythic get The
33.36,35.99,Medallion knock
36.0,38.99,one dead oh Dead all right my team are
39.0,40.27,already destroying everyone I'm just
40.28,41.79,sitting in a little corner spraying some
41.8,43.59,juice on myself contributing absolutely
43.6,45.51,nothing to my team I told these guys
45.52,48.27,"they get $2,000 each if we get unreal"
48.28,50.63,that is crazy luck it luck it so they
50.64,52.63,were immediately motivated to destroy
52.64,54.43,these unranked players it honestly felt
54.44,56.75,like bullying 10 time fncs Champions
56.76,58.91,against literal children 5 minutes in I
58.92,60.15,haven't even got a kill yet I need to
60.16,61.31,get a kill I need to feel like I'm
61.32,64.31,contributing full box full box I'm
64.32,65.99,getting bullied by the people I hired to
66.0,67.429,get me to one real I didn't pay to get
67.439,68.59,bullied all right I had enough of that
68.6,71.07,as a
71.08,73.429,kid this is a speedrun bro you need to
73.439,76.55,lock in I'm locked in man it was unfair
76.56,78.429,but the boys had to get as many kills as
78.439,80.23,possible so we could get a good starting
80.24,82.03,rank in the house in the house go go go
82.04,84.27,now's your chance to shine I'm in I'm
84.28,87.51,in I got one oh my god get greedy get
87.52,90.39,greed I'm contributing oh my God I'm
90.4,92.389,insane unfortunately even against these
92.399,94.27,players I still struggled I'm being
94.28,99.27,sniped at and he's using
99.28,101.83,earthbending okay fire bending
101.84,104.389,sucks first death of the video already
104.399,106.19,yeah 14 minutes in getting rebooted for
106.2,108.069,the first time that's crazy two players
108.079,112.069,remaining we have 28 kills let me in
112.079,115.99,nice yes all right let's get our rank
116.0,119.19,easy win oh come on just give me the
119.2,122.029,we're doing this it's a speed run gold
122.039,124.749,three 31% all right you're all bronze
124.759,126.35,but uh your rank doesn't matter let's
126.36,129.389,start a reboot counter reboot counter is
129.399,131.27,one I have a feeling that's going to be
131.28,133.07,a much higher number by the end of this
133.08,134.67,game one was pretty embarrassing I only
134.68,136.67,got two kills I'm hoping to change that
136.68,138.47,unfortunately we were having very long
138.48,139.79,cues and that was slowing down our
139.8,141.229,speedrun so we have to go play on
141.239,142.99,American Service gold three let's see if
143.0,145.55,we can get the Platinum this game oh
145.56,148.39,uh lag I swear I built that wall
148.4,150.27,luckily these Pro players did not seem
150.28,152.229,to struggle with the lag we have to get
152.239,154.27,as many kills as possible every game
154.28,156.11,there is no time to waste all right I'm
156.12,157.75,going update the reboot while I'm
157.76,159.589,getting rebooted now two all right let's

185.44,187.509,him the Americans are so stupid they
187.519,188.99,just eliminate
189.0,194.07,themselves oh too easy too easy we're in
194.08,196.11,Platinum last time it took me 23 games
196.12,197.43,to get to platinum sitting there doing
197.44,198.83,nothing we just did it in two games all
198.84,200.509,right still on American servers first
200.519,202.509,game of platinum in game three since the
202.519,204.07,boys were killing everyone and I was
204.08,205.83,doing basically nothing I was getting a
205.84,208.229,little bored so I decided I was going to
208.239,210.509,build a sky base have a bit of fun and
210.519,212.309,try and get the final kill got myself
212.319,214.35,Max Materials my job's done if these
214.36,215.63,guys just eliminate the rest of the
215.64,217.07,lobby I'll be good look at my fortnite
217.08,219.03,clan there I'm now an Esports team we've
219.04,220.99,started Team Laser I stole these guys
221.0,223.19,from Team power Lin's team it sounds
223.2,224.63,better than power it actually doesn't
224.64,227.39,sound too bad wo whoa wo calm down well
227.4,229.149,the boys obviously wiped the entire
229.159,230.71,lobby but I wasn't worried about that
230.72,232.39,I'm going up I spent all game getting
232.4,234.589,mats while you guys got 28 kills my turn
234.599,236.03,to get the kill all right do we know
236.04,237.55,where the last one is yeah I'm looking
237.56,238.869,at him right now and this could be a
238.879,240.309,tough shot hopefully I don't get shot
240.319,243.39,down oh right the drop off is crazy this
243.4,245.309,guy is just like trying to enjoy his
245.319,246.99,like Tuesday or something and he's just
247.0,252.429,getting bullied he moved so much oh
252.439,256.59,that hey we got him Max height
256.6,259.749,snip we didn't even 96 we didn't even
259.759,261.39,rank up that's actually such a scam game
261.4,263.189,four was the same we destroyed everyone
263.199,264.83,I was almost feeling bad that these
264.84,266.87,Platinum Players were being wiped out by
266.88,268.99,fncs Champions but I didn't feel that
269.0,270.39,bad because of of course we're going to
270.4,272.87,bully the last guy oh the Avatar he's in

284.919,287.59,2 What's Happening
287.6,291.029,Here 81% though so much of our time had
291.039,293.189,been spent sitting in cues but the next
293.199,295.79,game we finally got an Australian server
295.8,297.11,let's put on a good show on our own

496.24,497.909,was a disaster I died to storm
497.919,499.67,immediately but the boys won the game to
499.68,501.189,keep the win streak alive which also
501.199,502.71,proved I was contributing nothing and
502.72,504.51,was completely useless so we tried it
504.52,507.469,again go win the game boys hurry up

910.0,912.59,has to leave 4 hours remaining and maybe
912.6,914.15,I should have taken this more seriously
914.16,915.87,but of course I was just going to sit on
915.88,917.629,reboots oh someone's driving past they
917.639,920.189,need a reboot
924.759,926.829,really oh no they're coming to reboot

947.88,949.55,build walls in these lobbies the boys
949.56,951.23,were doing what they were good at and I
951.24,953.47,was doing what I was good at absolutely
953.48,956.509,nothing oh someone's coming here yeah
956.519,959.949,he's he's liter he oh is running away oh
961.6,964.309,tragic you should have rebooted come on
964.319,967.949,man oh it was 20% that's not terrible at
967.959,969.47,this point I really should have stopped
969.48,971.55,sitting on reboot Vans but I was really
971.56,974.509,committed unfortunately disaster
974.519,976.35,struck I'm
976.36,980.189,dead 8 8 W these Pro players all died I

998.079,1000.71,these guys to die so the next game I
1000.72,1002.79,decided to change things up and take it
1002.8,1005.59,super seriously I'm just kidding I sat
