0,20,I am speed running from bronze to Unreal last season I spent over 100 hours getting unreal without moving 308 games now my goal is 10 hours world record time I 've hired three of Australia 's best players Alex worthy and Luda they have 10 fncs championships between them I will not be leaving this setup until I have unreal we are currently

40,60,"I 'm just sitting in a little corner spraying some juice on myself contributing absolutely nothing to my team I told these guys they get $ 2,000 each if we get unreal that is crazy luck it luck it so they were immediately motivated to destroy these unranked players it honestly felt like bullying 10 time fncs Champions against literal children 5 minutes in I have n't even got a kill yet I"
60,80,need to get a kill I need to feel like I 'm contributing full box full box I 'm getting bullied by the people I hired to get me to one real I did n't pay to get bullied all right I had enough of that as a kid this is a speedrun bro you need to lock in I 'm locked in man it was unfair but the boys had to get as many kills as possible so we could get a good
80,100,starting rank in the house in the house go go go now 's your chance to shine I 'm in I 'm in I got one oh my god get greedy get greed I 'm contributing oh my God I 'm insane unfortunately even against these players I still struggled I 'm being sniped at and he 's using
100,120,earthbending okay fire bending sucks first death of the video already yeah 14 minutes in getting rebooted for the first time that 's crazy two players remaining we have 28 kills let me in nice yes all right let 's get our rank easy win oh come on just give me the we 're
120,140,doing this it 's a speed run gold three 31 % all right you 're all bronze but uh your rank does n't matter let 's start a reboot counter reboot counter is one I have a feeling that 's going to be a much higher number by the end of this game one was pretty embarrassing I only got two kills I 'm hoping to change that unfortunately we were having very long cues and that was slowing down our
140,160,speedrun so we have to go play on American Service gold three let 's see if we can get the Platinum this game oh uh lag I swear I built that wall luckily these Pro players did not seem to struggle with the lag we have to get as many kills as possible every game there is no time to waste all right I 'm going update the reboot while I 'm getting rebooted now two all right let 's
160,180,wipe them boys got him oh my God you all suck do n't try and ra your friends you 're all trash and in this Lobby I was actually able to contribute oh on laggy servers as well annihilated you 're trash uh one player remaining let 's uh Whack Him with the pickaxe got 35 kills it 's too easy
180,200,for us something in this game you know for us something in this game you know oh what I wanted to I wanted to pickax him the Americans are so stupid they just eliminate themselves oh too easy too easy we 're in Platinum last time it took me 23 games to get to platinum sitting there doing nothing we just did it in two games all right still on American
200,220,servers first game of platinum in game three since the boys were killing everyone and I was doing basically nothing I was getting a little bored so I decided I was going to build a sky base have a bit of fun and try and get the final kill got myself Max Materials my job 's done if these guys just eliminate the rest of the lobby I 'll be good look at my fortnite clan there I 'm now an Esports team we 've started Team
220,240,Laser I stole these guys from Team power Lin 's team it sounds better than power it actually does n't sound too bad wo whoa wo calm down well the boys obviously wiped the entire lobby but I was n't worried about that I 'm going up I spent all game getting mats while you guys got 28 kills my turn to get the kill all right do we know where the last one is yeah I 'm looking at him right now and this could be a tough shot hopefully I do n't
240,260,get shot down oh right the drop off is crazy this guy is just like trying to enjoy his like Tuesday or something and he 's just getting bullied he moved so much oh that hey we got him Max height snip we did n't even 96 we did n't even rank
260,280,up that 's actually such a scam game four was the same we destroyed everyone I was almost feeling bad that these Platinum Players were being wiped out by fncs Champions but I did n't feel that bad because of of course we 're going to bully the last guy oh the Avatar he 's in the Box he 's the final player get him get him get him yeah we still
280,300,maintain a 100 % win rate over an hour and 30 minutes in how much do I get in Platinum 2 What 's Happening Here 81 % though so much of our time had been spent sitting in cues but the next game we finally got an Australian server let 's put on a good show on our own servers oh my God oh my God it feels so good I was
300,320,very excited for no lag bro it feels so nice I 'm in heaven there 's a rebooting squad over here now that we 're on our own servers I think I can get him okay oh my God I swear there 's like two squads here oh oh oh I got one add one to
320,340,the reboot counter all right I 'm the reboot counter all right I 'm back oh God oh God not again not another yep even on Australian servers I sucked but the boys certainly do n't with zero lag they were even more deadly and we got the most kills we 've gotten so far one guy left 48 kills might just start a
340,360,storm right now in 3 2 1 oh what no way there is no way you just did that no way you just called that l no why is that lowkey crazy oh with Platinum 3 already all right do we go all the way up not quite a 48 kill game I gave you one kill it 's

600,620,annihilating every player we saw man they 're already dead before I can see where they 've gone over here yeah on me on me they 're already just by the time you 've called them out they 're dead I 'm so confused somehow with unreal players we got more kills than ever before we wanted to get to 50 oh my God two more people two more kills for 50

640,660,oh we 're 4 hours in woo lucky I 'm going to have plenty of Game Stops to keep me awake all through the night we may have 10 fncs championships between us but playing fortnite for this long can lead mistakes I 'm dead there 's another one yeah I I do n't have any ammo I 'm dead yeah I 'd say just play for the win streak play for the win
660,680,streak now I 'm dead after we all died the win streak was in Alex 's hands but he 's a three - time fncs champion it was fine all right Alex clutched up nice Alex bro do n't worry Guys these lobes sure are getting serious eh I 've updated the reboot counter a few times that close call was like a slap in the face it woke us up we went

800,820,rejuvenated myself otherwise this is world record Pace as fast as possible I 've switched up the gamer Subs flavor to go with my skin cuz now I was in Elite I wanted to sit on reboot Vans and do memes while these boys destroyed the lobby as we loaded into our first game of elite the lobbies were going to get harder but we were feeling good we were feeling refreshed the game started as normal but things
820,840,slowly started to turn 8 white 8 white slowly started to turn 8 white 8 white bro disaster struck we 've thrown we 've thrown we 've thrown the 12 game win streak was in Worthy 's hands I 'm out no no the win streak no no
840,860,bro no why is this guy being weird bro no the win Stak after 12 straight games we die on spawn it took us 5 hours and 40 minutes to die Focus up we 've just lost percent we can not afford any more mistakes this is a
860,880,speed run knock one knocked two dead you guys do all that I 'm going to sit on this reboot van I 'm sure even in Elite lobbies this is going to work the boys went absolutely crazy this game I was n't paying him to lose with you guys killing everyone so fast someone will have to reboot War oh oh there 's
880,900,someone coming they 're rebooting but there 's a wall here hold on he still kind of fell for it all right he 's dead good to know even elite players are that stupid one player left all right you got him first try 46 kills in a
900,920,leite gives us 21 % are you trolling we need to do this before 9:00 I got something on at 9:00 the reason we only had 10 hours to get this done Alex has to leave 4 hours remaining and maybe I should have taken this more seriously but of course I was just going to sit on reboots oh someone 's driving past they need a
920,940,reboot really oh no they 're coming to reboot they 're coming to reboot okay I 'm going standby bro he 's coming coming he 's smart he 's building around it just just let it cook let it cook let it cook oh my god oh oh I 'm not in that box I 'm going for it oh they fell for
