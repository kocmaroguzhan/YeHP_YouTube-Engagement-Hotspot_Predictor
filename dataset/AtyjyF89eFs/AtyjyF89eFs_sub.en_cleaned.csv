103.96,106.389,Middleton Island the FAA has a weather
106.399,108.429,station here so once a month a crew
108.439,110.51,comes to do maintenance and there's a
110.52,112.709,team of biologists studying birds out
112.719,113.99,here and those two ladies on the
114.0,115.55,four-wheeler are biologists and they
115.56,117.149,offered to give us a tour of their
117.159,121.55,research facility
121.56,123.91,see some rabbit poo rumor has it this
123.92,126.35,island is infested with feral rabbits so
126.36,128.229,Tommy brought a little air rifle oh look
128.239,133.43,at this oh look at that it's a it's a
133.44,136.309,jaw oh we got so lucky on the weather
136.319,138.43,the Gulf of Alaska is not known for
140.959,143.99,gentle here look at this it's all ship
144.0,146.309,wreck yeah it's an old landing
146.319,148.67,craft do you guys know how this boat got
148.68,151.47,all the way up here 1964 there was a
151.48,153.79,massive earthquake the second biggest
153.8,155.91,ever recorded in the history of man and
155.92,158.11,during that earthquake Middleton Island
158.12,160.91,Rose 12 ft out of the ground all the
160.92,163.27,shoreline below these Bluffs didn't
163.28,168.07,exist before
170.12,173.03,oh rabbit you just saw a
173.04,175.509,rabbit there's wood here there's rabbits
175.519,177.39,to hunt the waterers right there so we
177.4,179.229,go fishing I think this might be a good
179.239,181.27,spot to camp yeah I think maybe over
181.28,203.789,here yeah I'm going to get all the Rocks
203.799,206.509,off all

236.0,238.509,good we got lunch in us I think it's
238.519,243.429,time to explore the island
243.439,245.429,so this right here is part of the FAA
245.439,247.39,facility here on Middleton Island it's
247.4,249.75,mostly a weather station and pretty much
249.76,251.71,all the commercial flights that go from
251.72,253.83,Asia and North America come up through
253.84,255.75,the Gulf of Alaska so this weather
255.76,257.349,station keeps an eye on all the weather
257.359,260.229,within a 250 M radius helps keep a lot
260.239,262.749,of people
262.759,266.909,safe oh just saw another
266.919,268.909,rabbit so another thing interesting

877.759,880.949,favorite camping meals such an easy meal
880.959,882.829,cor one thing I like about this cooking
882.839,884.31,method is that because the food doesn't
884.32,886.389,touch the water you can use salt water
886.399,888.91,and I'm also doing my dishes with it and
888.92,890.31,it can get all nasty and it doesn't
890.32,892.31,matter cuz it ain't going to touch my
892.32,896.79,food got all
896.8,899.43,this you guys ready let's go explore the
899.44,901.59,island some more do you want to just
901.6,904.949,push it up the hill yeah you can see
904.959,906.749,these Bluffs that go the length of both
906.759,908.509,sides of the island that's where the
908.519,910.59,shore was before the earthquake in a
910.6,913.069,period of 5 minutes during an earthquake
913.079,914.829,all of that land came up out of the
914.839,916.949,ocean and this island doubled in size
916.959,918.43,can't believe how amazing that would
918.44,920.269,have been to watch both my parents were
920.279,922.03,in Alaska during that earthquake and
922.04,929.069,they've got some crazy stories
929.079,931.23,let's go stop over here there's a
931.24,932.87,shipwreck on the island so we're going
932.88,934.55,to ask some of the biologists if they
934.56,937.11,can get us directions to how to get to
937.12,939.269,it over here that looks like a sombrero
939.279,941.47,oh yeah yeah but I I got some cherries

1006.72,1009.71,cesta this is an old FAA air traffic
1009.72,1011.79,control navigation site it's used to
1011.8,1013.749,help planes navigate when they're flying
1013.759,1015.829,over the Gulf of
1015.839,1018.71,Alaska bald eagle up there there's a ton

1056.88,1059.39,the ship ground to avoid being torpedoed
1059.4,1061.19,so this shipwreck's been here for about
1061.2,1063.75,80 years and now it's turned into a
1063.76,1066.83,giant bird
1066.84,1069.549,Rookery look at those giant anchors the
