0,20,Luke here at the art Boys YouTube channel and welcome to Middleton Island Alaska for the next 3 days me and my boys are going to be traveling to this remote island in the Gulf of Alaska to explore abandoned military bases catch and cook feral rabbits surf fish from the beach explore World War II shipwrecks and tag along with biologists studying
20,40,Birds wish that I could stay wish for this moment to never
40,60,go away but it 's all in my mind and though I know that there is nothing to find you 're beautiful sight in the Su night that 's right and you ca n't put
60,80,up a fire in the light welcome to Middleton
80,100,Island should we go explore and find a yeah say hi oh hi my this is my son Tommy and Nathan and I 'm Luke by the way are you full - time are you grad students or
100,120,what are you students only a few people ever come to Middleton Island the FAA has a weather station here so once a month a crew comes to do maintenance and there 's a team of biologists studying birds out here and those two ladies on the four - wheeler are biologists and they offered to give us a tour of their research
120,140,facility see some rabbit poo rumor has it this island is infested with feral rabbits so Tommy brought a little air rifle oh look at this oh look at that it 's a it 's a jaw oh we got so lucky on the weather the Gulf of Alaska is not known for
140,160,gentle here look at this it 's all ship wreck yeah it 's an old landing craft do you guys know how this boat got all the way up here 1964 there was a massive earthquake the second biggest ever recorded in the history of man and during that earthquake Middleton Island Rose 12 ft out of the
160,180,ground all the shoreline below these Bluffs did n't exist before oh rabbit you just saw a rabbit there 's wood here there 's rabbits to hunt the waterers right there so we go fishing I think this might be a good spot to camp
180,200,yeah I think maybe over here yeah I 'm going to get all
200,220,the Rocks off all right o we got it so you 've got a couple options this is a
220,240,sliced ham wrap or we can do hot dog that 's good we got lunch in us I think it 's time to
240,260,explore the island so this right here is part of the FAA facility here on Middleton Island it 's mostly a weather station and pretty much all the commercial flights that go from Asia and North America come up through the Gulf of Alaska so this weather station keeps an eye on all the weather within a 250 M radius helps keep a
260,280,lot of people safe oh just saw another rabbit so another thing interesting about Middleton island is there 's an abandoned military base on this island and you can see the birds have taken over oh
280,300,look at all this equipment it 's just sitting in here look at this old water fountain oh and a dead bird this is a very strong smell of seafood and Bird
300,320,I wo n't yeah car I 'm really worried about you guys stepping on a nail in here oh here 's the
320,340,bathrooms all the power boxes got be so careful I do n't want to step on a nail or something out
340,360,here oh my goodness that building is full of gold what stop I see one right there hold on hold on I just saw one hop over there Tom I know it 's just a
360,380,tiny B oh there 's one right there see him he just look at look at n look at oh he 's so close he was so close see him oh there 's a bunch right in here it 's my favorite type of hunting lots of shooting and no gutting okay you got that here you hold on to the
380,400,he 's in between those two generators in the end these rabbits we 're hunting are not wild rabbits they 're actually feral they were released here on the island and they have no natural Predators there 's no other mammals here on this island so there 's just tons and tons of these rabbits and the rabbits do compete with some of the birds for Den
400,420,locations how gun is come up here see it can you see this can you see him right here other one 's just sitting right there see him do you see him get him okay go wait wait just

640,660,backpack is heavy there 's a whole lot of rabbit in here not a very big island it 's only about 5 miles long but all in all we did uh probably close to 10 miles today not bad
660,680,for two little boys we need to find a cutting board that
680,700,is a fat definitely okay to do you got to take your knife two is you got to scream all this junk off you you let
700,720,why see okay I ca n't that 's how you you get it all on a spit right there is this good I do n't no I I vacuum sealed some delicious steaks with a little bit of butter and rosemary we 're going to put
720,740,those in here here Nathan 's rabbit 's so fat it 's taking forever to cook over the fire so I think we 're going to go stew
740,760,it all right
760,780,got you guys pretty full yeah let 's get ready for bed we do some dessert in bed okay took the dishes down to the ocean
780,800,and uh managed to get my shoes pretty and uh managed to get my shoes pretty wet yeah hopefully my my shoes will dry overnight Nathan where 'd you go I ca n't see
800,820,you you 're camouflaged you no farting in my good sleeping bags okay you guys are probably too tired for dessert no no then we 'll pull out the uh chocolate caramel ganache brownies how about that oh my goodness yeah ganache is basically decadent fudge what do you think you like ganach I love it we 're going
820,840,to see you guys in the morning we 've got a lot of exploring to do all right Dad good morning D good morning Nathan I get up and make breakfast it 's 8:00 in the morning and I already need sunscreen the Sun is is intense
840,860,up here in Alaska but it 's up for so long that you can get burned oh we 're going to have some biscuits and gravy so I got some homemade sausage gravy that I vacuum sealed and froze just going to go ahead and put it in some hot
860,880,water get it all piping hot here 's ready me thank you Dad is biscuits and gravy one of your favorite camping meals
880,900,such an easy meal cor one thing I like about this cooking method is that because the food does n't touch the water you can use salt water and I 'm also doing my dishes with it and it can get all nasty and it does n't matter cuz it ai n't going to touch my food got all this you guys ready let 's go explore the island
900,920,some more do you want to just push it up the hill yeah you can see these Bluffs that go the length of both sides of the island that 's where the shore was before the earthquake in a period of 5 minutes during an earthquake all of that land came up out of the ocean and this island doubled in size ca n't believe how amazing that would have been to watch both my
920,940,parents were in Alaska during that earthquake and they 've got some crazy stories let 's go stop over here there 's a shipwreck on the island so we 're going to ask some of the biologists if they can get us directions to how to get to it over here that looks like a sombrero oh yeah
940,960,yeah but I I got some cherries I 'm assuming fresh fresh fruit is just make make sure to share as best you can well anyway I 'll see you guys at two and thank you very much awesome yeah have a great time you thank you I think I heard most of these researchers have been out here since uh May so by this point they
960,980,'re probably craving fruit and vegetables we 've probably seen 15 bunnies already they 're just everywhere they 're a different species of animal than the native Snowshoe hair which we see on the mainland of Alaska you guys
980,1000,tired yes you tired you guys really that tired yeah all right you just sit here for a second who wants to watch a show and eat some chocolates me come over here take a take a seat in the rabbit poop here have a chocolate covered almond dark and forbidden Secrets the boys
1000,1020,are pretty tired I think they might be a little sore from yesterday so we 're going to we 're going to take it easy have a cesta this is an old FAA air traffic control navigation site it 's used to help planes navigate when they 're flying over the Gulf of Alaska bald eagle up there there 's a ton of of them on the island
1020,1040,you guys feeling better all right you guys ready yep oh look at this just ca n't look at that shipwreck that thing is huge we got to get down this cliff and through
1040,1060,those marshes I 'm I just took one this shipwreck is from World War II this is a cargo ship that was being hunted by a Japanese submarine so the captain ran the ship ground to avoid being torpedoed so this
1060,1080,shipwreck 's been here for about 80 years and now it 's turned into a giant bird Rookery look at those giant anchors the chances of us not getting pooped on are low oh yeah there 's a bald eagle nest way up to the top plenty for him to feed on down here oh man look at the hole
1080,1100,in side you can just hear this Seagle poop raining around us if one of us had french fries would ' be dead oh there 's so much poop landing around take
1100,1120,cover I that bar I kind of want to go in here explore but birds tend to have fleas and lice and there 's just tons of crap on the ground I 'm so afraid if I go in there I 'm going to end up with fleas in my pants I do n't do n't
1120,1140,want that so badly oh what did you eat that was huge this is an aircraft you know my dad was attacked by seagulls once yeah they broke his rod us right now yeah they are so bobbing us yeah there 's the drive sh

1280,1300,right under the tower is kind of a s yeah do n't look down if you do n't like like we 're in the top of this Tower and these birds have nested all along the outside and they 've built these
1300,1320,little glass windows and doors so they can access the nests without disturbing the birds too much and and is this a kitty wake y every morning we ride down every bird on the tower so if anyone does n't come home you know about it is that a catch or is it just broken a new broken you
1320,1340,sure write that down yeah so Tom saw an egg that rolled out of the nest and broken that 's getting written down that 's data they 're filing a CPS report you probably noticed all the eggs are colored red or blue yeah the red ones are were the first ones that were laid the blue is the second oh so that 's you 're doing there yeah and the dates are on the tape oh
