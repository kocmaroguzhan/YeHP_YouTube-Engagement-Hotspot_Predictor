0,5,Luke here at the art Boys YouTube channel and welcome to Middleton Island Alaska for the next
5,10,3 days me and my boys are going to be traveling to this remote island in the Gulf of Alaska to explore
10,15,abandoned military bases catch and cook feral rabbits surf fish from the beach
15,20,explore World War II shipwrecks and tag along with biologists studying
20,25,Birds
30,35,wish that I could
35,40,stay wish for this moment to never
40,45,go away but it 's all in my mind and though I
45,50,know that there is nothing to find
50,55,you 're beautiful sight in the Su
55,60,night that 's right and you ca n't put
60,65,up a fire in the
70,75,light welcome to Middleton
85,90,Island should we go explore and find a
90,95,yeah say hi oh hi my this is my
95,100,son Tommy and Nathan and I 'm Luke by the way are you full - time are you grad students or
100,105,what are you students only a few people ever come to Middleton
105,110,Island the FAA has a weather station here so once a month a crew comes to do maintenance and
110,115,there 's a team of biologists studying birds out here and those two ladies on the four - wheeler are
115,120,biologists and they offered to give us a tour of their research
120,125,facility see some rabbit poo rumor has it this island is
125,130,infested with feral rabbits so Tommy brought a little air rifle oh look at this oh
130,135,look at that it 's a it 's a jaw oh we got so
135,140,lucky on the weather the Gulf of Alaska is not known for
140,145,gentle here look at this it 's all ship wreck yeah
145,150,it 's an old landing craft do you guys know how this boat got all the way up
150,155,here 1964 there was a massive earthquake the second biggest ever recorded in the
155,160,history of man and during that earthquake Middleton Island Rose 12 ft out of the
160,165,ground all the shoreline below these Bluffs did n't
165,170,exist before
170,175,oh rabbit you just saw a rabbit there 's wood here there
175,180,'s rabbits to hunt the waterers right there so we go fishing I think this might be a good spot to camp
180,185,yeah I think maybe over here
185,190,yeah I 'm going to get all the Rocks
205,210,off all right
210,215,o we got it
215,220,so you 've got a couple options this is a
220,225,sliced ham wrap or we can do hot
230,235,dog that 's
235,240,good we got lunch in us I think it 's time to
240,245,explore the island so this right here is part
245,250,of the FAA facility here on Middleton Island it 's mostly a weather station and pretty much all
250,255,the commercial flights that go from Asia and North America come up through the Gulf of Alaska so
255,260,this weather station keeps an eye on all the weather within a 250 M radius helps keep a
260,265,lot of people safe oh just
265,270,saw another rabbit so another thing interesting about Middleton
270,275,island is there 's an abandoned military base on this island and you
275,280,can see the birds have taken over oh
280,285,look at all this equipment it 's just
285,290,sitting in here look at this old
290,295,water fountain oh and a dead bird this is a very strong smell of
295,300,seafood and Bird
300,305,I wo n't yeah car I
305,310,'m really worried about you guys stepping on a nail in
310,315,here oh here 's the

720,725,those in here
725,730,here Nathan 's rabbit 's so fat it 's taking forever to cook
730,735,over the fire so I think we 're going

825,830,all right Dad good morning D good morning
830,835,Nathan I get up and make
835,840,breakfast it 's 8:00 in the morning and I already need sunscreen the Sun is is intense
840,845,up here in Alaska but it 's up for so long that you can get burned
845,850,oh we 're going to have some
850,855,biscuits and gravy so I got some homemade sausage gravy that I vacuum sealed
855,860,and froze just going to go ahead and put it in some hot
860,865,water get it all piping
865,870,hot
870,875,here 's ready me thank
875,880,you Dad is biscuits and gravy one of your favorite camping meals
880,885,such an easy meal cor one thing I like about this cooking method is that because the food does n't touch the
885,890,water you can use salt water and I 'm also doing my dishes with it and it can get all nasty and it
890,895,does n't matter cuz it ai n't going to touch my food
895,900,got all this you guys ready let 's go explore the island
900,905,some more do you want to just push it up the hill yeah you can see
905,910,these Bluffs that go the length of both sides of the island that 's where the shore was before the
910,915,earthquake in a period of 5 minutes during an earthquake all of that land came up out of the
915,920,ocean and this island doubled in size ca n't believe how amazing that would have been to watch both my
920,925,parents were in Alaska during that earthquake and they 've got
925,930,some crazy stories let 's go stop
930,935,over here there 's a shipwreck on the island so we 're going to ask some of the biologists if they can
935,940,get us directions to how to get to it over here that looks like a sombrero oh yeah
940,945,yeah but I I got some cherries I 'm assuming fresh fresh fruit is just
945,950,make make sure to share as best you can well anyway I 'll see you guys at two and
950,955,thank you very much awesome yeah have a great time you thank you I think I heard most of
955,960,these researchers have been out here since uh May so by this point they
960,965,'re probably craving fruit and vegetables we 've
965,970,probably seen 15 bunnies already they 're just everywhere they 're a different
970,975,species of animal than the native Snowshoe hair which we see on the
975,980,mainland of Alaska you guys
980,985,tired yes you tired you guys really that
985,990,tired yeah all right you just sit here for a second who wants to watch a
990,995,show and eat some chocolates me come over here take a take a seat in

1000,1005,are pretty tired I think they might be a little sore from yesterday so we 're going to we 're going to take it easy have a
1005,1010,cesta this is an old FAA air traffic
1010,1015,control navigation site it 's used to help planes navigate when they 're flying over the
1015,1020,Gulf of Alaska bald eagle up there there 's a ton of of them on the island
1020,1025,you guys feeling better all right you guys
1025,1030,ready yep oh look at this just ca n't look at that shipwreck
1030,1035,that thing is huge we got to get down this cliff and
1035,1040,through those marshes
1045,1050,I 'm I just took one
1050,1055,this shipwreck is from World War II this is a cargo ship that was being hunted by a Japanese
1055,1060,submarine so the captain ran the ship ground to avoid being torpedoed so this
1060,1065,shipwreck 's been here for about 80 years and now it 's turned into a
1065,1070,giant bird Rookery look at those giant anchors the
1070,1075,chances of us not getting pooped on are low oh yeah there 's a bald eagle nest way up to the
1075,1080,top plenty for him to feed on down here oh man look at the hole
1080,1085,in side you can just hear this Seagle poop
1085,1090,raining around us if one of us had french fries would ' be dead oh
1090,1095,there 's so much poop landing
1095,1100,around take
1100,1105,cover I that
1105,1110,bar I kind of want to go in here explore but
1110,1115,birds tend to have fleas and lice and there 's just tons of crap on the ground
1115,1120,I 'm so afraid if I go in there I 'm going to end up with fleas in my pants I do n't do n't
1120,1125,want that so badly oh what did you eat that was

1280,1285,right under the
1285,1290,tower is kind of a s yeah
1290,1295,do n't look down if you do n't like like we 're in the top of
1295,1300,this Tower and these birds have nested all along the outside and they 've built these
1300,1305,little glass windows and doors so they can access the nests without disturbing the birds too
1305,1310,much and and is this a kitty wake y every morning we ride down
1310,1315,every bird on the tower so if anyone does n't come home you know about it is that a
1315,1320,catch or is it just broken a new broken you
1320,1325,sure write that down yeah so Tom saw an egg that rolled out of the nest and broken that 's
1325,1330,getting written down that 's data they 're filing a CPS report you probably
1330,1335,noticed all the eggs are colored red or blue yeah the red ones are were the first ones that were laid
1335,1340,the blue is the second oh so that 's you 're doing there yeah and the dates are on the tape oh
