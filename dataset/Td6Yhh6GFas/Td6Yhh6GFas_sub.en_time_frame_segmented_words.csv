0,5,how many pixels is that though well someone 's going to have to do the math on screen just like 1
5,10,billion pixels I 've got in front of me something called the fusion doc Max one for my vany
10,15,and this is probably the most capable dock that I 've ever seen or had if
15,20,this thing comes crashing down that is
20,25,"literally $ 21,000 cracked that 's so"
25,30,crazy I mean
30,35,I guess it 'll be counter weighted this
35,40,thing is capable of pumping Out video from a
40,45,MacBook to three 6 K displays and one 4 K
45,50,display from one single dock we actually happen to have those
50,55,monitors here in the studio we 'll just have to pile them together and then of course LG sent
55,60,us one of their latest my view smart monitors in order to make up that final
60,65,monitor to add to this wild setup now the way that this works is obviously via
65,70,Thunderbolt it is designed for Mac OS and it is designed for up to a quad monitor
70,75,setup I think the best way to do this is to do the three xdr
75,80,displays 6 K * three along the bottom and then we 'll do the 4 K display on the
80,85,top it 's going to require a little bit of adjustment I have n't used this
85,90,particular Mount before but it seems like it 'll have the reach all
90,95,your peripherals keyboard mouse you 're going to get a built - in SD card slot we 've got
95,100,gigabit Ethernet so we can stay wired we 've also got a security slot so we can keep everything locked
100,105,down power delivery over the Thunderbolt cable so we can deliver 96
105,110,watts of power and we 've got optical watts of power and we 've got optical audio if we want to send digital
110,115,audio out to any of our uh external gear it all mounts to the desk and then it 's height
115,120,adjustable via this pole but it will be a kind of trial and error
120,125,situ ation to figure out your Heights
125,130,this looks roughly where I need to be so that
130,135,'ll work but then we may run out of space above I
135,140,think we got to go lower
140,145,maybe there I mean I do n't think we can go any lower I think
145,150,that 's it just like this that 's it so because these plates are so easy to take on and
150,155,off I guess if you did want to adjust the height at a later moment it
155,160,would n't be that big of a
165,170,deal how the
170,175,how do you tighten that piece if we have a Mac
175,180,Mini M1 or M2 basically any of these laptops can go to a single display that 's that
180,185,'s not much of a surprise dual display now we 're talking about MacBook Pro M1
185,190,M2 M3 Pro or a Mac Mini with an M2 Pro and then when we talk about quad displays we 're
190,195,looking at MacBook Pros that are either M1 M2 or M3 Max for the
195,200,purpose of this setup that we 're going to build we 're going to go with an M3 Max
200,205,yeah so this has a tension piece on it to adjust your angle and the amount of force
205,210,required to move that angle after you have it mounted so you have to offset for
210,215,whatever type of weight you 're dealing
220,225,with this is going to be interesting this is going
225,230,to be quite interesting oh man well these are
230,235,"precarious mounts hey can you imagine putting $ 20,000 worth of"
235,240,monitors on this Mount look at it it 's already
240,245,bending that way
260,265,jeez oh my God
265,270,that 's a lot of pixels right there 6 K * 3 I 'm always going to
270,275,put the math right here total number of pixels currently and we 're going to still add 4 K to it
275,280,this is the LG my view smart Monitor and what 's cool about this is having this as your fourth monitor it
280,285,'s a 4k monitor this is the maximum output from the M3 Max MacBook Pro 36k 1
285,290,14k but what 's cool about this it has a remote control it 's a smart monitor so it behaves kind of
290,295,like a TV dive into the smart interface and just like watch Netflix or stream sports or
295,300,whatever you want to do just write
300,305,on the monitor natively
305,310,the other cool thing about this monitor is it
310,315,'s going to have speakers as
315,320,wow that 's pretty
320,325,cool jeez and I like the double 32 like it 's just so symmetrical and
325,330,I suppose you could take the the upper one and put a little
330,335,more tilt on it yeah like that
335,340,it 's kind of tilting down oh yeah sick oh
340,345,yeah oh yeah oh yeah I forgot it also comes with a webcam a
345,350,magnetically attaching webcam they showed me this at CES and it 's got
350,355,the Privacy shield on it there 's a magnetic connection point
355,360,on the back here lines up with this and your camera
360,365,just fits on there and if you want it off for whatever reason boom gone so it
365,370,'s like double privacy comes with an HDMI cable that 's a
370,375,bonus this is what I 'm talking about dedicated remote volume all your smart
375,380,TV controls dedicated buttons for Netflix Disney plus Prime video they
380,385,do give you some cables to get up and running and the most interesting one is this one
385,390,right here so this is a dual Thunderbolt cable which will interface with
390,395,your MacBook Pro and the dock so when you look at the dock here and you see the
395,400,laptop portion this dual cable slots in like that so you 're only having
400,405,one cable to attach I love the one cable system to give you that
405,410,bandwidth that throughput that you 're going to need to pump all those pixels okay so
410,415,everything is plugged in it 's kind of messy like it 's just proof of concept make
415,420,sure everything works I have a keyboard and
420,425,that have been connected and then we have our special cable with
425,430,the Dual Thunderbolt connections to drive all of
430,435,these monitors so the top monitor is HDMI into the ivank
435,440,dock the others are using those 6 K Thunderbolt ports so just let 's just see
440,445,how everything reacts to being plugged in
445,450,here allow accessory yes allow
450,455,oh okay so we
455,460,definitely have the cinema displays and then maybe this needs to be
460,465,on and then I 'm
465,470,going to just jump into system
470,475,settings and displays LG Smart UHD
475,480,arrange and I 'll move that guy up there
485,490,Behold a lot of pixels a a
490,495,very a very very lot very lot of pixels most pixels I 've ever
495,500,sat in front of possibly 3 *
500,505,6 K 1 * 4 K wow to push this many pixels from
505,510,a laptop is impressive it is a high - powered laptop but but it 's
510,515,still impressive that laptop uses 96 WS of power you 're getting
515,520,that full power delivery from the dock so single cable power and all
520,525,of these pixels and it 's really like obviously we did n't manage the cables yet
525,530,but it 's really not that many when you look at it like this would be fairly easy to manage
530,535,we have a single HDMI there 's two Thunderbolts here 's the specialty cable
535,540,going out to the laptop and then power to the dock the dock really enhances the convenience of doing
540,545,something like this can I have the laptop monitor or do I lose the other
545,550,one when I open up the
550,555,laptop oh you can have you you can
555,560,have all you can have them all so jeez
560,565,that 's even more pixels these tops are your actual
565,570,resolutions 616 by 3384 * 3 3840 by
570,575,2160 and then 3456 by 2234
575,580,plus plus plus
580,585,plus yeah that 's
585,590,happening whoa whoa the
590,595,viewing angles on these xdr displays is great by the way like I 'm just
595,600,realizing I can sit here and even having these things on
600,605,this angle they look great this is
605,610,quite the cockpit like curved monitors are cool and all
610,615,that but they are nowhere near the resolution that Mo 's going to put
615,620,on the screen right now after he
620,625,does the calculation all right so we move this setup a little bit and we 're getting it dialed in
625,630,like you can see there 's a little bit of cable management going on which is kind of key when you have have this
630,635,much Hardware our dock is doing the heavy lifting right now spitting out all of these pixels
635,640,that 's pretty wild and our peripherals are n't wired right now so we still have
640,645,tons of potential IO that we could use but we just have a wireless keyboard and mouse for the time
645,650,being this Mount that I purchased we just discovered an interesting thing when you
650,655,are dialing in your fit for your variety of monitors you have this crank
655,660,in the center of the two middle mounted displays that
660,665,lets you slightly raise or lower each in order to
665,670,create a flush multim monitor setup so in this case we just spin
670,675,this guy One Direction or the other and it will travel either up or down
675,680,and currently this is going up but I could technically bring
680,685,this down or tilt it more tilt it more like this I mean I could do both tilt it and
685,690,bring it down
700,705,yeah I do n't see a need to have this laptop anywhere near me
705,710,because I have so much screen real estate already I just
710,715,walk up plug in my laptop step over
715,720,here wake it up
720,725,I actually have some updates for the xdr displays
725,730,look at that so clean look at all my desk space H the scaling is
730,735,different so they 're now all running the same scaled resolution see
735,740,that so when you when I pull or drag something between the two it 's the
740,745,exact same size even though obviously we have 6 K and 4 K we
745,750,were trying to figure out like what the optimal kind of setup was would be
750,755,like where you would put your YouTube where you would put your
755,760,Photoshop where you would put your final cut if you would put social media anywhere I
760,765,mean it 's versatile there 's a lot of different ways you could utilize this you have your YouTube up there
765,770,your media up there you could be listening to music up there you know some people like to play like lowii just have it
770,775,playing up there doing your work down here it 's not one extra thing that the that the PC or in
775,780,this case the MacBook is doing this could easily be Final Cut Pro it could be photo shop if you
780,785,were in Final Cut the other thing you could do is you could put your output monitor over here so you just always got like a
785,790,full screen of what your edit is looking like look to take advantage of this
790,795,dock you do n't need to run this extreme use case you could just
795,800,have a bunch of peripherals a wired keyboard or a Wired Mouse that you prefer
800,805,audio equipment that can remain connected to the dock and maybe only one monitor maybe two monitors
805,810,instead and they do n't have to be xdr displays this Mount is actually pretty pretty affordable I think
810,815,it was like 150 bucks the main important thing here is regardless of how you choose to
815,820,configure it when you 're ready to go and take your work with you all you 've got to do is just
820,825,remove the one cable that 's it now I 'm ready to go and part of the reason that
825,830,people dread having the laptop as the desktop setup is the plugging and
830,835,unplugging of all the things that are typically connected on a desktop this is the
835,840,easiest version possible and because you have that dual Thunderbolt cable you 've got the
840,845,throughput that you need for highspeed storage and tremendous
845,850,resolutions of
