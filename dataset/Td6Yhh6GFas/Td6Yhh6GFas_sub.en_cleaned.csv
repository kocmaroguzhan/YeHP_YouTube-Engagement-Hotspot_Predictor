0.04,1.35,how many pixels is that though well
1.3599999999999999,2.35,someone's going to have to do the math
2.36,5.67,on screen just like 1 billion pixels
5.68,7.23,I've got in front of me something called
7.24,10.23,the fusion doc Max one for my vany and
10.24,13.35,this is probably the most capable dock
13.36,15.629,that I've ever seen or had if this thing
15.639,17.15,comes crashing
17.16,20.029,down that is literally
20.039,23.349,"$21,000 cracked that's so"
23.359,30.91,crazy I mean
30.92,34.83,I guess it'll be counter weighted this
34.84,38.27,thing is capable of pumping Out video
38.28,43.75,from a MacBook to three 6K displays and
43.76,47.79,one 4K display from one single dock we
47.8,50.029,actually happen to have those monitors
50.039,51.83,here in the studio we'll just have to
51.84,54.63,pile them together and then of course LG
54.64,57.029,sent us one of their latest my view
57.039,59.189,smart monitors in order to make up that
59.199,60.43,final monitor
60.44,62.83,to add to this wild setup now the way
62.84,64.59,that this works is obviously via
64.6,67.23,Thunderbolt it is designed for Mac OS
67.24,69.31,and it is designed for up to a quad
69.32,71.749,monitor setup I think the best way to do
71.759,75.67,this is to do the three xdr displays 6K
75.68,77.83,* three along the bottom and then we'll
77.84,81.069,do the 4K display on the top it's going
81.079,82.91,to require a little bit of adjustment I
82.92,85.67,haven't used this particular Mount
85.68,89.069,before but it seems like it'll have the
89.079,91.51,reach all your peripherals keyboard
91.52,93.71,mouse you're going to get a built-in SD
93.72,95.95,card slot we've got gigabit Ethernet so
95.96,97.91,we can stay wired we've also got a
97.92,99.35,security slot so we can keep everything
99.36,102.35,locked down power delivery over the
102.36,104.99,Thunderbolt cable so we can deliver 96
105.0,107.429,watts of power and we've got optical
107.439,110.069,audio if we want to send digital audio
110.079,112.67,out to any of our uh external gear it
112.68,114.23,all mounts to the desk and then it's
114.24,116.67,height adjustable via this pole but it
116.68,120.029,will be a kind of trial and error situ
120.039,123.59,ation to figure out your Heights
123.6,126.95,this looks
126.96,129.15,roughly where I need to
129.16,131.949,be so that'll work but then we may run
131.959,137.11,out of space above I think we got to go
137.12,141.39,lower maybe
141.4,143.67,there I mean I don't think we can go any
143.68,146.869,lower I think that's it just like this
146.879,148.79,that's it so because these plates are so
148.8,151.07,easy to take on and off I guess if you
151.08,152.91,did want to adjust the height at a later
152.92,157.96,moment it wouldn't be that big of a
168.8,172.03,deal how the how do you tighten that
172.04,176.11,piece if we have a Mac Mini M1 or M2
176.12,178.99,basically any of these laptops can go to
179.0,180.27,a single display that's that's not much
180.28,182.229,of a surprise dual display now we're
182.239,185.589,talking about MacBook Pro M1 M2 M3 Pro
185.599,188.07,or a Mac Mini with an M2 Pro and then
188.08,189.75,when we talk about quad displays we're
189.76,192.03,looking at MacBook Pros that are either
192.04,195.99,M1 M2 or M3 Max for the purpose of this
196.0,197.35,setup that we're going to build we're
197.36,200.71,going to go with an M3 Max yeah so this
200.72,202.949,has a tension piece on it to adjust your
202.959,205.509,angle and the amount of force required
205.519,206.869,to move that angle after you have it
206.879,208.83,mounted so you have to offset for
208.84,219.75,whatever type of weight you're dealing
219.76,222.07,with this is going to be interesting
222.08,226.949,this is going to be quite
226.959,229.39,interesting oh man well these are
229.4,231.83,precarious mounts hey can you imagine
231.84,234.71,"putting $20,000 worth of"
234.72,237.149,monitors on this Mount look at it it's
237.159,241.47,already bending that way
261.919,264.469,jeez oh my
264.479,267.03,God that's a lot of pixels right there
267.04,268.71,6K *
268.72,270.99,3 I'm always going to put the math right
271.0,273.029,here total number of pixels currently
273.039,274.79,and we're going to still add 4K to it
274.8,276.83,this is the LG my view smart Monitor and
276.84,278.51,what's cool about this is having this as
278.52,280.71,your fourth monitor it's a 4k monitor
280.72,283.029,this is the maximum output from the M3
283.039,285.909,Max MacBook Pro 36k 1 14k but what's
285.919,287.83,cool about this it has a remote control
287.84,289.51,it's a smart monitor so it behaves kind
289.52,291.55,of like a TV dive into the smart
291.56,293.95,interface and just like watch Netflix or
293.96,295.749,stream sports or whatever you want to do
295.759,307.029,just write on the monitor natively
307.039,309.31,the other cool thing about this monitor
309.32,312.83,is it's going to have speakers as
316.56,320.51,wow that's pretty cool
320.52,323.51,jeez and I like the double 32 like it's
323.52,325.79,just so symmetrical and I suppose you
325.8,328.67,could take the the upper one and put a
328.68,331.469,little more tilt on
331.479,334.35,it yeah like
334.36,338.07,that it's kind of tilting down oh yeah
338.88,342.95,sick oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I forgot it
342.96,345.189,also comes with a webcam a magnetically
345.199,348.189,attaching webcam they showed me this at
348.199,352.23,CES and it's got the Privacy shield on
352.24,354.909,it there's a magnetic connection point
354.919,357.95,on the back here lines up with this and
357.96,360.59,your camera just
360.6,362.79,fits on there and if you want it off for
362.8,365.39,whatever reason boom gone so it's like
365.4,369.27,double privacy comes with an HDMI cable
369.28,371.39,that's a bonus this is what I'm talking
371.4,374.51,about dedicated remote volume all your
374.52,377.029,smart TV controls dedicated buttons for
377.039,380.029,Netflix Disney plus Prime video they do
380.039,381.51,give you some cables to get up and
381.52,384.309,running and the most interesting one is
384.319,386.629,this one right here so this is a dual
386.639,389.27,Thunderbolt cable which will interface
389.28,392.43,with your MacBook Pro and the dock so
392.44,394.35,when you look at the dock here and you
394.36,397.55,see the laptop portion this dual cable
397.56,399.909,slots in like that so you're only having
399.919,402.43,one cable to attach I love the one cable
402.44,405.749,system to give you that bandwidth that
405.759,407.189,throughput that you're going to need to
407.199,410.79,pump all those pixels okay so everything
410.8,413.029,is plugged in it's kind of messy like
413.039,415.15,it's just proof of concept make sure
415.16,418.51,everything works I have a keyboard and
420.08,421.71,that have been connected and then we
421.72,425.07,have our special cable with the
425.08,429.39,Dual Thunderbolt connections to drive
429.4,431.99,all of these monitors so the top monitor
432.0,436.309,is HDMI into the ivank dock the others
436.319,439.309,are using those 6K Thunderbolt ports so
439.319,440.469,just let's just see how everything
440.479,442.95,reacts to being plugged in
444.68,448.94,here allow accessory yes allow
452.84,456.71,oh okay so we definitely have the cinema
456.72,458.629,displays and then maybe this needs to be
462.16,463.83,on and
463.84,468.39,then I'm going to just jump into system
468.4,474.43,settings and displays LG Smart UHD
474.44,486.83,arrange and I'll move that guy up there
486.84,490.83,Behold a lot of pixels a a very a very
490.84,493.51,very lot very lot of pixels most pixels
493.52,496.309,I've ever sat in front of
496.319,500.749,possibly 3 * 6K 1 *
500.759,505.029,4K wow to push this many pixels from a
505.039,508.07,laptop is impressive it is a
508.08,510.07,high-powered laptop but but it's still
510.08,513.35,impressive that laptop uses 96 WS of
513.36,515.829,power you're getting that full power
515.839,518.829,delivery from the dock so single cable
518.839,521.909,power and all of these pixels and it's
521.919,524.149,really like obviously we didn't manage
524.159,526.15,the cables yet but it's really not that
526.16,528.07,many when you look at it like this would
528.08,530.509,be fairly easy to manage we have a
530.519,533.59,single HDMI there's two Thunderbolts
533.6,535.31,here's the specialty cable going out to
535.32,537.19,the laptop and then power to the dock
537.2,539.19,the dock really enhances the convenience
539.2,541.31,of doing something like this can I have
541.32,542.949,the laptop monitor or do I lose the
542.959,551.11,other one when I open up the
551.12,555.11,laptop oh you can have you you can have
555.8,560.43,all you can have them all so jeez that's
560.44,562.99,even more pixels these tops are your
563.0,565.389,actual resolutions
565.399,567.15,616 by
567.16,573.79,3384 * 3 3840 by 2160 and then 3456 by
573.8,578.31,2234 plus plus plus
578.32,587.47,plus yeah that's
587.48,591.15,happening whoa whoa the viewing angles
591.16,593.269,on these xdr displays is great by the
593.279,596.67,way like I'm just realizing I can sit
596.68,599.87,here and even having these things on
599.88,602.509,this angle they look
602.519,605.59,great this is quite the
605.6,608.43,cockpit like curved monitors are cool
608.44,609.47,and all
609.48,613.31,that but they are nowhere near the
613.32,615.19,resolution that Mo's going to put on the
615.2,620.829,screen right now after he does the
620.839,622.71,calculation all right so we move this
622.72,624.23,setup a little bit and we're getting it
624.24,626.19,dialed in like you can see there's a
626.2,627.99,little bit of cable management going on
628.0,629.55,which is kind of key when you have have
629.56,631.79,this much Hardware our dock is doing the
631.8,633.91,heavy lifting right now spitting out all
633.92,636.47,of these pixels that's pretty wild and
636.48,638.19,our peripherals aren't wired right now
638.2,641.629,so we still have tons of potential IO
641.639,643.31,that we could use but we just have a
643.32,644.75,wireless keyboard and mouse for the time
644.76,647.11,being this Mount that I purchased we
647.12,649.269,just discovered an interesting thing
649.279,651.629,when you are dialing in your fit for
651.639,654.31,your variety of monitors you have this
654.32,657.629,crank in the center of the two middle
657.639,661.55,mounted displays that lets you slightly
661.56,665.509,raise or lower each in order to create a
665.519,668.43,flush multim monitor setup so in this
668.44,671.509,case we just spin this guy One Direction
671.519,673.91,or the other and it will travel either
673.92,677.87,up or down and currently this is going
677.88,680.23,up but I could technically bring this
680.24,682.949,down or tilt it more tilt it more like
682.959,684.91,this I mean I could do both tilt it and
684.92,687.52,bring it down
700.16,702.67,yeah I don't see a need to have this
702.68,705.87,laptop anywhere near me because I have
705.88,709.03,so much screen real estate already I
709.04,711.23,just walk up plug in my
711.24,714.629,laptop step over
714.639,717.23,here wake it up
722.48,723.99,I actually have some updates for the xdr
724.0,727.269,displays look at that so clean look at
727.279,729.87,all my desk space H the scaling is
729.88,732.31,different so they're now all running the
732.32,735.91,same scaled resolution see that so when
735.92,737.949,you when I pull or drag something
737.959,740.87,between the two it's the exact same size
740.88,744.829,even though obviously we have 6K and 4K
744.839,746.47,we were trying to figure out like what
746.48,749.79,the optimal kind of setup was would be
749.8,752.269,like where you would put your
752.279,754.629,YouTube where you would put your
754.639,756.949,Photoshop where you would put your final
756.959,759.31,cut if you would put social media
759.32,761.79,anywhere I mean it's versatile there's a
761.8,763.47,lot of different ways you could utilize
763.48,765.15,this you have your YouTube up there your
765.16,766.47,media up there you could be listening to
766.48,767.91,music up there you know some people like
767.92,770.43,to play like lowii just have it playing
770.44,771.99,up there doing your work down here it's
772.0,774.47,not one extra thing that the that the PC
774.48,776.87,or in this case the MacBook is doing
776.88,778.59,this could easily be Final Cut Pro it
778.6,780.509,could be photo shop if you were in Final
780.519,781.67,Cut the other thing you could do is you
781.68,783.35,could put your output monitor over here
783.36,785.23,so you just always got like a full
785.24,788.43,screen of what your edit is looking like
788.44,790.23,look to take advantage of this dock you
790.24,793.829,don't need to run this extreme use case
793.839,795.75,you could just have a bunch of
795.76,798.43,peripherals a wired keyboard or a Wired
798.44,801.069,Mouse that you prefer audio equipment
801.079,802.629,that can remain connected to the dock
802.639,804.389,and maybe only one monitor maybe two
804.399,805.79,monitors instead and they don't have to
805.8,808.87,be xdr displays this Mount is actually
808.88,810.189,pretty pretty affordable I think it was
810.199,812.75,like 150 bucks the main important thing
812.76,814.829,here is regardless of how you choose to
814.839,817.31,configure it when you're ready to go and
817.32,819.15,take your work with you all you've got
819.16,821.11,to do is just remove the one cable
821.12,823.069,that's it now I'm ready to go and part
823.079,826.389,of the reason that people dread having
826.399,829.11,the laptop as the desktop setup is the
829.12,830.949,plugging and unplugging of all the
830.959,832.67,things that are typically connected on a
832.68,836.189,desktop this is the easiest version
836.199,838.189,possible and because you have that dual
838.199,839.71,Thunderbolt cable you've got the
839.72,842.43,throughput that you need for highspeed
842.44,845.67,storage and tremendous resolutions of
