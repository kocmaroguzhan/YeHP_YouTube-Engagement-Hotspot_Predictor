0,20,Hello friends it 's me today we are watching videos that will make your brain hurt I look some skis wo how ' you do that is it broken is it chewy is it stretchy what how is it doing this okay this I ca n't tell if it 's AI or not because it looks way too realistic but like how do they do that it has to be an edit
20,40,like that thing is stretchy it 's glitching up I think there 's something wrong with your skis you got to wait for them to patch Us in the next update Ro is climbing a ladder right okay wow very cool very cool have you noticed there 's no support on this ladder oh is he going to go through it is he going to pull himself through it and somehow end oh he did a flip even
40,60,better wo you know nothing but sheer determination and Aura keeping this ladder up bro flipped himself on a freestanding ladder do you have any idea how much strength this would take this is like extremely impressive I would even think I could do this on a ladder with some legs with three people holding the ladder bro just casually pretending
60,80,that gravity does n't exist knock knock who 's there wa your cat is huge wait a second maybe the house is small oh that 's a child okay this is weird it looks like a very modern apartment there 's also cars
80,100,outside it 's even got an elevator it even makes the elevator sounds and has marble floors like bro this is like a super modern futuristic Barbie playhouse for billionaire kids it 's even got ambient Lighting on the ceiling for friends sake it 's got a backlit mirror in the
100,120,bathroom this has to be a replica of somebody 's very fancy house it 's probably this big maybe bigger kids look like giants in here just drink half a bottle of water we 'll save the other half for later okay everyone does this bro made a little water bottle boat nothing could
120,140,have prepared me for this moment you drink half a bottle of water half right vertically not horizontally what 's wrong with you enjoy sipping the other half from your little water bottle boat and leave me out of these Shenanigans I spent 2 weeks looking for my iPad do you see the iPad the cover of the iPad matches the seat perfectly it looks like it
140,160,'s part of the seat has nobody accidentally sat on this like is that my frail buttbone or an iPad usually when you lose something that you use all the time it 's usually right in front of your eyes and then you miss it like where did my glasses go oh nine times out of 10 they 're on my head this is an optical illusion called The Parallax effect where it looks like like the plane is just
160,180,floating in place bro is glitching in real time just casually over the ocean like hold on I 'm waiting for the other plane to pass before I go so he 's actually moving and if you keep watching the video you can kind of see like he 's over the bridge now but the way that the planes are moving together when you move in the same parallel plane it looks like you 're not moving at all pretty cool huh
180,200,this is the sanso football stadium in Milan it has a spiral walkway and when people are walking on it it looks like the entire staircase is rotating but it 's not it 's just the people making it look like it 's rotating is n't that so cool like it looks like it 's spinning no the people are making it look like it 's spinning by walking down you know what if they all
200,220,walked up it would rotate the other way walked up it would rotate the other way remake instant Ramen okay it 's finished wait what are you doing why did you drain it why are you cleaning it are n't you going to eat it are we reversing the entire process with a fine tooth comb rearrange all the noodles and the
220,240,dried toppings oh wow put in the oven to dehydrate it put all of the toppings in a little contain oh wait oh wait bro bro was
240,260,really dedicated to reversing the ramen he prints out the ramen package oh we 're doing this legit just like brand new you could have just used another Ramen package no not good enough we started at 100 and now we 're at one even the little seasoning packet I 'm shook he like reduced the sauce he did a
260,280,little reduction into a concentration and then put it all back where it belongs you seal it off with a hair straightener and it 's like brand new congratulations you can get one whole dollar for that now I ca n't believe bro just DIY some packaged Ramen you can restore to factory settings revert to its
280,300,original form the dehydrated Ramen Circle and the packets I can not believe this now sell it to somebody see if they notice a difference I wonder if somebody would cook this again and they 'd be like something missing 50 % of the flavor is gone almost tastes like it 's been cooked before one star how do you like your fries with ketchup on the side or ketchup drizzled on top either way
300,320,okay wrong answer this is how this guy does fries ketchup then fries then ketchup then fries then more ketchup and another layer are you the guy who ordered extra fries with your ketchup here let me just top you off a little bit fantastic oh man the fury completely missed the fries it 's the best part completely normal treatment of your average ketchup lover backing
320,340,an 18 - wheeler like a pro there is no way that truck can back up into that corner like you 're already too far ahead like how do you even do this the parking lot is full you hit the other truck it 's so close bro you like you 're already messed up bro there 's like three spots next to it like empty spots no you 're going to hit it you 're going to hit the car oh stop doing that stop going in and out you ai
340,360,n't a burger oh wow okay that was actually very impressive you know maybe that 's the tech the In - N - Out until you get it right oh he 's so long and awkward it 's just the way I like my men I hate these AI videos you 're watching a plate of mushrooms and then what is that Suddenly It 's a bird when did it
360,380,it turned into a bird or a penguin are those Penguins bro why are they on a plate my mushrooms they got up and walked away like it honestly feels like a fever dream like bro what just happened that mushroom looked at me funny and then suddenly they evolved into penguins and then walked away like who 's making these AI videos either way I do
380,400,n't like it that guy got left behind he just wanted to be a mushroom he did n't choose the penguin life I do n't like it they be messing with my head I 'm telling you a few years from now like you 're you 're not going to be able to tell the difference between real and AI bro I can s this video to my mom and then she 'd be like Is that real college practices are no joke why oh why is it
400,420,moving like that how do you move your calf muscle like that like by itself there 's something living inside there that 's about to give you a cramp if the nerve becomes injured or becomes irritated it causes the calf muscle to involuntarily twitch that 's why he said College practices are no joke they got his calf working overtime that thing has been awoken this a mind
420,440,of its own it 's going to be involuntarily twitching from now on because you 've worked him so hard wait is bro standing on his door okay no standing on the floor but wait a second he put his feet up and then his arms wait how bro just casually defies gravity gravity just does n't exist in this room like how can you stand on one wall
440,460,yes no problem and then stand on the door like it 's no problem well I 'm so confused is this like a optical illusion maybe you got some sticky feet I actually have no idea how we did this okay I already know this is going to be one of them AI videos it 's going to be grapes and they 're going to transformed into something I 'm not ready for what okay let 's see it grapes are
460,480,those kittens oh dogs yes some nonchalant grapes that turn into some very chalant dogs I do n't like it they did n't even make their final transformation I love grapes I 'm not going to let this video ruin grapes for me these grapes are not the best we 're going to tiar rank grapes real quick assuming they are all crunchy green grapes a these purple
480,500,grapes a these grapes B the dark purple ones also known as Moon balls C I do n't think I 've ever had these crunchy before cotton candy grapes B long purple grapes D no they 're going to ruin blackberries for me too bro I was literally just eating blackberries and now
500,520,you 're going to ruin blackberries for me too and those look like the biggest most suculent blackberries I 've ever seen I know this is going to be like AI generated it 's going to transform or something I saw it move I seen it it 's turning into a bird ew it was n't even blackberries they were literally Birds I hate it can we stop that 's enough food to animal AI there are two bike wheels
520,540,spinning towards the ball the ball is going to get thrown inside and it just launches it up into the sky I was not expecting that to happen now clearly I do n't know my physics I thought it would just be like trapped inside that ball got yeated further than Ronaldo they took a stick put it on the waterfall and then it just like illuminated the rest of the waterfall bro
540,560,just controlled the flow of water is it physics or are you a water bender okay that seemed very unlikely that all of these colored but wait wait wait wait wait how does it even happen they have to be sorted by weight but like they 're all trapped inside there and then when you unleash them all the balls go into their respective color category how 's that physics how does that even happen why are there so
560,580,much less red balls than blue balls man I would love to have this as a kid I would try to shake it up and try to get them to mix I 'll show you physics you know I 've seen some crazy makeup but she got her hand inside her face how 'd you do this wait where are her fingers the entire hand was a prosthetic oh the fingers are still in there wait a second there 's another look this time the fingers
