11.08,14.35,stretchy what how is it doing this okay
14.36,16.07,this I can't tell if it's AI or not
16.08,17.99,because it looks way too realistic but
18.0,19.59,like how do they do that it has to be an
19.6,21.47,edit like that thing is stretchy it's
21.48,22.99,glitching up I think there's something
23.0,24.47,wrong with your skis you got to wait for
24.48,26.55,them to patch Us in the next update Ro
26.56,30.029,is climbing a ladder right okay wow very
30.039,32.51,cool very cool have you noticed there's
32.52,34.43,no support on this ladder oh is he going
34.44,36.229,to go through it is he going to pull
36.239,38.19,himself through it and somehow end oh he
38.2,41.11,did a flip even better wo you know
41.12,43.75,nothing but sheer determination and Aura
43.76,45.99,keeping this ladder up bro flipped
46.0,48.869,himself on a freestanding ladder do you
48.879,50.91,have any idea how much strength this
50.92,53.15,would take this is like extremely
53.16,54.79,impressive I would even think I could do
54.8,56.709,this on a ladder with some legs with
56.719,58.91,three people holding the ladder bro just
58.92,60.91,casually pretending that gravity doesn't
60.92,63.869,exist knock knock who's there wa your
63.879,66.03,cat is
66.04,69.19,huge wait a second maybe the house is
69.2,72.109,small oh that's a
72.119,75.87,child okay this is weird it looks like a
75.88,78.469,very modern apartment there's also cars
78.479,83.55,outside it's even got an
83.56,85.91,elevator it even makes the elevator
85.92,88.63,sounds and has marble floors like bro
88.64,91.39,this is like a super modern futuristic
91.4,94.109,Barbie playhouse for billionaire kids
94.119,96.03,it's even got ambient Lighting on the
96.04,98.31,ceiling for friends sake it's got a
98.32,100.91,backlit mirror in the bathroom this has
100.92,103.71,to be a replica of somebody's very fancy
103.72,106.069,house it's probably this big maybe
106.079,108.749,bigger kids look like giants in here
108.759,110.709,just drink half a bottle of water we'll
110.719,113.19,save the other half for later okay
113.2,116.069,everyone does
116.079,119.029,this bro made a little water bottle boat
119.039,121.029,nothing could have prepared me for this
121.039,123.069,moment you drink half a bottle of water
123.079,126.149,half right vertically not horizontally
126.159,128.15,what's wrong with you enjoy sipping the
128.16,129.71,other half from your little water bottle
129.72,131.55,boat and leave me out of these
131.56,134.19,Shenanigans I spent 2 weeks looking for
134.2,136.71,my iPad do you see the iPad the cover of
136.72,139.35,the iPad matches the seat perfectly it
139.36,140.869,looks like it's part of the seat has
140.879,142.91,nobody accidentally sat on this like is
142.92,145.27,that my frail buttbone or an iPad
145.28,146.99,usually when you lose something that you
147.0,149.11,use all the time it's usually right in
149.12,150.79,front of your eyes and then you miss it
150.8,153.15,like where did my glasses go oh nine
153.16,154.949,times out of 10 they're on my head this
154.959,156.509,is an optical illusion called The
156.519,158.79,Parallax effect where it looks like like
158.8,160.83,the plane is just floating in place bro
160.84,163.07,is glitching in real time just casually
163.08,164.869,over the ocean like hold on I'm waiting
164.879,167.03,for the other plane to pass before I go
167.04,168.99,so he's actually moving and if you keep
169.0,170.55,watching the video you can kind of see
170.56,172.55,like he's over the bridge now but the
172.56,174.75,way that the planes are moving together
174.76,176.99,when you move in the same parallel plane
177.0,178.75,it looks like you're not moving at all
178.76,180.869,pretty cool huh this is the sanso
180.879,182.949,football stadium in Milan it has a
182.959,185.19,spiral walkway and when people are
185.2,187.309,walking on it it looks like the entire
187.319,189.71,staircase is rotating but it's not it's
189.72,191.71,just the people making it look like it's
191.72,194.27,rotating isn't that so cool like it
194.28,196.509,looks like it's spinning no the people
196.519,198.27,are making it look like it's spinning by
198.28,199.99,walking down you know what if they all
200.0,202.75,walked up it would rotate the other way
202.76,205.509,remake instant Ramen okay it's
205.519,207.509,finished wait what are you doing why did
207.519,209.75,you drain it why are you cleaning it
209.76,211.39,aren't you going to eat it are we
211.4,214.11,reversing the entire process with a fine
214.12,216.429,tooth comb
216.439,218.47,rearrange all the
218.48,221.869,noodles and the dried toppings oh wow
221.879,228.4,put in the oven to dehydrate
233.0,235.55,it put all of the
235.56,238.589,toppings in a little contain oh wait oh
238.599,241.19,wait bro bro was really dedicated to
241.2,243.27,reversing the ramen he prints out the
243.28,246.03,ramen package oh we're doing this legit
246.04,248.229,just like brand new you could have just
248.239,250.589,used another Ramen package no not good
250.599,253.069,enough we started at 100 and now we're
253.079,256.11,at one even the little seasoning packet
256.12,259.509,I'm shook he like reduced the sauce he
259.519,261.909,did a little reduction into a
261.919,263.95,concentration and then put it all back
263.96,266.07,where it belongs you seal it off with a
266.08,268.31,hair straightener and it's like brand
268.32,270.71,new congratulations you can get one
270.72,272.67,whole dollar for that now I can't
272.68,275.95,believe bro just DIY some packaged Ramen
275.96,278.55,you can restore to factory settings
278.56,280.629,revert to its original form the
280.639,283.59,dehydrated Ramen Circle and the packets
283.6,285.55,I cannot believe this now sell it to
285.56,287.469,somebody see if they notice a difference
287.479,288.71,I wonder if somebody would cook this
288.72,289.83,again and they'd be like something
289.84,292.189,missing 50% of the flavor is gone almost
292.199,294.39,tastes like it's been cooked before one
294.4,296.55,star how do you like your fries with
296.56,298.67,ketchup on the side or ketchup drizzled
298.68,301.23,on top either way okay wrong answer this
301.24,303.27,is how this guy does fries ketchup then
303.28,305.55,fries then ketchup then fries then more
305.56,307.23,ketchup and another layer are you the
307.24,308.67,guy who ordered extra fries with your
308.68,311.029,ketchup here let me just top you off a
311.039,313.31,little bit fantastic oh man the fury
313.32,315.31,completely missed the fries it's
315.32,316.95,the best part completely normal
316.96,319.27,treatment of your average ketchup lover
319.28,322.27,backing an 18-wheeler like a pro there
322.28,324.83,is no way that truck can back up into
324.84,326.43,that corner like you're already too far
326.44,328.309,ahead like how do you even do this the
328.319,330.189,parking lot is full you hit the other
330.199,331.95,truck it's so close bro you like you're
331.96,333.629,already messed up bro there's like three
333.639,335.629,spots next to it like empty spots no
335.639,336.629,you're going to hit it you're going to
336.639,338.629,hit the car oh stop doing that stop
338.639,340.749,going in and out you ain't a burger oh
340.759,342.309,wow okay that was actually very
342.319,343.71,impressive you know maybe that's the
343.72,346.51,tech the In-N-Out until you get it right
346.52,348.83,oh he's so long and
348.84,351.79,awkward it's just the way I like my
351.8,354.469,men I hate these AI videos you're
354.479,356.43,watching a plate of mushrooms and then
356.44,359.39,what is that Suddenly It's a bird when
359.4,361.07,did it it turned into a
361.08,364.79,bird or a penguin are those Penguins bro
364.8,366.95,why are they on a plate my mushrooms
366.96,368.71,they got up and walked away like it
368.72,370.71,honestly feels like a fever dream like
370.72,372.35,bro what just happened that mushroom
372.36,374.43,looked at me funny and then suddenly
374.44,376.309,they evolved into penguins and then
376.319,378.629,walked away like who's making these AI
378.639,380.67,videos either way I don't like it that
380.68,382.35,guy got left behind he just wanted to be
382.36,383.95,a mushroom he didn't choose the penguin
383.96,385.51,life I don't like it they be messing
385.52,387.309,with my head I'm telling you a few years
387.319,388.55,from now like you're you're not going to
388.56,390.07,be able to tell the difference between
390.08,392.11,real and AI bro I can s this video to my
392.12,394.27,mom and then she'd be like Is that real
394.28,398.83,college practices are no joke why
398.84,401.749,oh why is it moving like that how do you
401.759,403.67,move your calf muscle like that like by
403.68,405.35,itself there's something living inside
405.36,407.07,there that's about to give you a cramp
407.08,409.51,if the nerve becomes injured or becomes
409.52,412.11,irritated it causes the calf muscle to
412.12,414.51,involuntarily twitch that's why he said
414.52,416.629,College practices are no joke they got
416.639,418.67,his calf working overtime that thing has
418.68,420.629,been awoken this a mind of its own it's
420.639,422.83,going to be involuntarily twitching from
422.84,425.67,now on because you've worked him so hard
425.68,428.749,wait is bro standing on his door okay no
428.759,431.749,standing on the floor but wait a second
431.759,433.55,he put his feet up and then his arms
433.56,435.869,wait how bro just casually defies
435.879,437.71,gravity gravity just doesn't exist in
437.72,439.629,this room like how can you stand on one
439.639,441.749,wall yes no problem and then stand on
441.759,443.629,the door like it's no problem well I'm
443.639,445.589,so confused is this like a optical
445.599,447.67,illusion maybe you got some sticky feet
447.68,450.629,I actually have no idea how we did this
450.639,451.749,okay I already know this is going to be
451.759,453.67,one of them AI videos it's going to be
453.68,454.95,grapes and they're going to transformed
454.96,457.11,into something I'm not ready for what
457.12,458.67,okay let's see it
458.68,462.029,grapes are those kittens oh dogs yes
462.039,464.27,some nonchalant grapes that turn into
464.28,467.149,some very chalant dogs I don't like it
467.159,468.43,they didn't even make their final
468.44,470.189,transformation I love grapes I'm not
470.199,471.749,going to let this video ruin grapes for
471.759,473.469,me these grapes are not the best we're
473.479,475.589,going to tiar rank grapes real quick
475.599,477.71,assuming they are all crunchy green
477.72,481.43,grapes a these purple grapes a these
481.44,485.07,grapes B the dark purple ones also known
485.08,488.23,as Moon balls C I don't think I've ever
488.24,490.23,had these crunchy before cotton candy
490.24,495.749,grapes B long purple grapes D no they're
495.759,497.629,going to ruin blackberries for me too
497.639,499.189,bro I was literally just eating
499.199,500.39,blackberries and now you're going to
500.4,501.83,ruin blackberries for me too and those
501.84,503.83,look like the biggest most suculent
503.84,505.309,blackberries I've ever seen I know this
505.319,506.83,is going to be like AI generated it's
506.84,508.149,going to transform or something I saw it
508.159,511.309,move I seen it it's turning into a bird
511.319,513.389,ew it wasn't even blackberries they were
513.399,515.909,literally Birds I hate it can we stop
515.919,518.11,that's enough food to animal AI there
518.12,521.79,are two bike wheels spinning towards the
521.8,523.55,ball the ball is going to get thrown
523.56,526.07,inside and it just launches it up into
526.08,527.949,the sky I was not expecting that to
527.959,529.55,happen now clearly I don't know my
529.56,531.11,physics I thought it would just be like
531.12,533.03,trapped inside that ball got yeated
533.04,535.509,further than Ronaldo they took a stick
535.519,537.389,put it on the waterfall and then it just
537.399,538.99,like illuminated the rest of the
539.0,541.35,waterfall bro just controlled the flow
541.36,543.59,of water is it physics or are you a
543.6,545.509,water bender okay that seemed very
545.519,547.949,unlikely that all of these colored but
547.959,549.47,wait wait wait wait wait how does it
549.48,551.35,even happen they have to be sorted by
551.36,552.91,weight but like they're all trapped
552.92,554.75,inside there and then when you unleash
554.76,556.31,them all the balls go into their
556.32,557.829,respective color category how's that
557.839,559.269,physics how does that even happen why
559.279,560.99,are there so much less red balls than
561.0,562.87,blue balls man I would love to have this
562.88,564.63,as a kid I would try to shake it up and
564.64,566.949,try to get them to mix I'll show you
566.959,568.99,physics you know I've seen some crazy
569.0,571.03,makeup but she got her hand inside her
571.04,573.43,face how'd you do this wait where are
573.44,575.069,her fingers the entire hand was a
575.079,576.75,prosthetic oh the fingers are still in
576.76,578.67,there wait a second there's another look
578.68,580.67,this time the fingers are ripping off
580.68,582.63,her skin okay this is the coolest makeup
582.64,586.15,I've ever seen okay pull it out oh
586.16,588.55,wo okay it gets crazier cuz what the
588.56,590.71,heck is this where is anything on her
590.72,592.949,face where is her nose where are her
592.959,595.91,eyes it's a clean canvas okay play it I
595.92,597.71,got to see where her ey oh wa that
597.72,599.03,doesn't explain anything else where's
599.04,601.35,her nose where's your mouth I sacrific
601.36,603.55,my eyeballs and nose for a very large
603.56,605.11,mouth what are you for Halloween
605.12,607.829,certified yapper okay that's way too
607.839,610.47,cool that is these are so sick I love
610.48,612.59,optical illusion makeup there another
612.6,614.79,optical illusion on paper but it looks
614.8,616.67,like it's a ramp like the battery is
616.68,619.23,going to slide down
619.24,621.23,righte it looks like it's going to go
621.24,623.19,down a slide but it doesn't and it's
623.2,624.79,making my brain hurt I don't know how
624.8,626.59,much more of this I could take but
