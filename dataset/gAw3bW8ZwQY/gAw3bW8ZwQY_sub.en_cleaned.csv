0.64,1.22,Oh my
3.56,7.9,gosh. What is this?
12.88,14.39,"Hey, what's going on everybody for First"
14.4,15.91,We F East. I'm Sean Evans and you're
15.92,17.349,watching Hot Ones. It's the show with
17.359,19.109,hot questions and even hotter wings. And
19.119,20.87,today we're joined by Anna De Armis.
20.88,22.31,She's a Golden Globe and Oscar award
22.32,23.67,"nominated actress, you know, from films"
23.68,25.429,"like Knives Out, Blonde, No Time To Die,"
25.439,27.109,and many more. Her latest project though
27.119,28.63,is a starring role in the fifth film of
28.64,30.23,the John Wick franchise. It's called
30.24,31.83,Ballerina
31.84,33.27,and it's set to release in theaters on
33.28,35.43,"June 6th. Anna de Armis, welcome to the"
35.44,38.229,show. Thank you. How are you with spicy
38.239,40.47,food before we get started? I I'm not
40.48,43.35,good at all. Like I I honestly I knew
43.36,44.63,this was happening and I have been
44.64,54.23,practicing a little bit but not ready.
66.96,68.429,"Yeah, let's do"
68.439,75.109,"it. Okay, here we go."
75.119,76.749,"Well, this is"
76.759,79.71,"good. Oh, I like it. I'm doing"
79.72,86.469,good. This is great.
86.479,89.59,"It's yummy. So, the John Wick franchise"
89.6,91.51,is iconic for its imaginative use of
91.52,93.429,"violence. And not to give too much away,"
93.439,95.749,but I particularly enjoyed the Icegate
95.759,98.31,Massacre and the flamethrower duel. What
98.32,100.31,are the creative conversations like in
100.32,102.149,shaping a character like Eve's fighting
102.159,103.83,"style? Like, were there any interesting"
103.84,105.91,chats about how to tailor the signature
105.92,107.83,John Wick choreography to the skills of
107.84,110.069,"a ballerina turned assassin? Yeah, I"
110.079,113.27,mean I think we wanted to just keep
113.28,115.91,pushing the humor in the franchise. You
115.92,117.749,know that you watch the John Wick films
117.759,119.19,and sometimes the fights are really
119.2,121.429,"intense and gory, but it's the kind of"
121.439,122.95,action that you're just having so much
122.96,125.03,fun with. Like you put your fingers in
125.04,126.87,"in your on your face, but you're looking"
126.88,130.309,through you can't stop it. And also like
130.319,132.949,adding the val ballet element to it was
132.959,135.11,really important. Like I really wanted
135.12,138.07,to like see her. She's a woman in the
138.08,141.27,men's world and I wanted to feel like
141.28,143.91,"every punch, every kick, everything was"
143.92,146.07,hurting. Like I really wanted her to go
146.08,148.55,through that pain. Kind of reminds me of
148.56,150.39,the experience of doing Hot Ones. You
150.4,152.07,know what I mean? Like there's a certain
152.08,154.39,pain that you just become familiar with.
154.4,155.589,You know what I mean? And that always
155.599,157.19,allows you to push through cuz you know
157.2,159.589,on the other side you'll be fine. Yeah.
159.599,161.35,"All right, Anna, you're doing great."
161.36,163.19,Okay. Are you ready to move on here to
163.2,165.75,sauce number two? Number two. All right.
165.76,169.589,So up next we have just winging it.
181.28,185.99,Still good. Yeah. There we go.
186.0,189.11,So recently the Academy Awards announced
189.12,191.27,a new category to recognize achievement
191.28,193.509,in stunt design. Mhm. M if you were in
193.519,195.589,"charge of the criteria for that award,"
195.599,196.71,what do you think are like the most
196.72,198.55,important things to focus on? Like are
198.56,200.309,there elements of best of the best
200.319,201.91,Hollywood action sequences in your
201.92,204.949,opinion? I think yes. I would say like
204.959,207.03,feeling like it's a one like you know
207.04,209.509,like a one continuous shot. That would
209.519,212.149,be cool. That's important to to feel
212.159,215.27,like you're in the moment. Um so
215.28,218.27,definitely no cuts. No cuts. No cuts.
218.28,222.47,"Um, I would say just being original,"
222.48,224.229,like doing things that you haven't seen
224.239,226.63,"before, like surprising people. What"
226.64,228.47,else? What am I missing? I You know
228.48,230.229,"what? To me, you nailed it. That was you"
230.239,231.35,"just pulling an arrow, hitting a"
231.36,233.509,bullseye. Right. Y those two things.
233.519,236.149,Yep. How are you doing so far? I'm good.
236.159,240.07,I'm I'm good. Woo. I like that. From
240.08,241.67,nervous to confident. I can see it
241.68,244.98,already. It's not going to go well.
248.48,252.949,I'm ready.
252.959,254.869,"So, lately we've been in the habit of"
254.879,256.949,asking actors about the scenes that they
256.959,258.87,dreaded doing from the second they read
258.88,260.39,them in the script to when they saw it
260.4,262.79,up on the call sheet scheduled. Yeah.
262.8,264.87,What is it about the chaotic dinner
264.88,267.11,"scene in Eden, which I understand took 3"
267.12,269.43,"days to shoot, that made it one of the"
269.44,273.15,scariest things you've ever done?
273.16,276.469,"Singing. I hated it. I mean, I remember"
276.479,279.03,"when I talked to Ron and I was like,"
279.04,281.27,"""Ron, I really think I should lip- sync."
281.28,283.51,"Like, this is not for me."" And he he"
283.52,285.03,just didn't want to hear it. He was
285.04,286.23,"like, ""No, you're singing. You're"
286.24,287.909,"singing. It's, you know, if you do it"
287.919,289.35,"bad, it's good for the character."""
289.36,290.629,"That's what I'm like, ""Yeah, but people"
290.639,294.87,"don't know that."" Um, so anyways, I I"
294.88,296.55,just couldn't I just couldn't convince
296.56,298.31,"him to let me lip sync. So, I had to"
298.32,300.35,learn the
300.36,303.189,song. It was horrible. I was terrified.
303.199,306.07,I would rather do a hundred stunts than
306.08,309.27,"than sing song. Yeah, it was it was"
309.28,311.029,terrifying because also in front of all
311.039,312.629,the actors and I just I don't know. I
312.639,314.79,just I just felt very exposed and
314.8,317.51,vulnerable and it's not it's not one of
317.52,320.28,my talents for sure.
324.16,330.87,Every time I'm so nervous.
330.88,334.79,They're messy. They are messy.
334.8,336.15,And then just be careful around the
336.16,338.469,"eyes, you know."
338.479,339.909,"Yeah, I definitely don't want this on my"
339.919,343.189,"eyes. So, in the Spanish class SNL skit"
343.199,344.87,that you did with Marcelo Hernandez and
344.88,347.029,"Carol G, you rattle off a long list of"
347.039,349.59,"Cuban foods, everything from rope vieja"
349.6,352.39,"to durrio, if you were to put together"
352.4,354.95,"your last meal on earth Cuban style,"
354.96,356.629,"what would that feast look like? Like,"
356.639,357.749,what are the dishes that are most
357.759,361.749,"nostalgic to you? Oo, Cuban food is just"
361.759,364.07,"comfort food for me and it's very basic,"
364.08,366.39,you know. It's it's rice and beans. The
366.4,369.35,"black beans are my favorite. Um,"
369.36,373.27,"definitely raka. Uh, the toston is the"
373.28,376.23,"picadija is good, too. It's um minced"
376.24,378.55,meat in a in tomato sauce and with
378.56,380.95,olives and all that is like Cuban food
380.96,383.67,is really well like condimented.
383.68,385.59,It's not spicy. You say we're
385.6,387.51,condimented over here. No. No. but not
387.52,390.95,"this kind of uh spice. It's spices, not"
390.96,394.71,"spicy. So, it's it's just oh my gosh, I"
394.72,397.51,I love it. It's so it's so yummy. What
397.52,399.35,would you say distinguishes a grape
399.36,402.55,mojito from a mediocre one? I think it's
402.56,403.629,the the
403.639,406.23,the how much sugar you put it like it's
406.24,408.71,a fine line between making it like way
408.72,410.87,too sweet and like just the right
410.88,413.99,"amount, you know, like um and the rum is"
414.0,415.749,important. You have to. It's white rum
415.759,418.629,Havana 3. That's what it is. You can't
418.639,420.55,put anything else in it. Rules to live
420.56,423.52,by. Yes.
427.039,430.95,Oh my god.
430.96,433.27,Would you like the mustard? It's all
433.28,434.95,"right. You know, I'm kind of like you. I"
434.96,437.43,kind of like the more citrusy Yeah. hot
437.44,439.589,"sauces. You know, like a little uh fruit"
439.599,442.309,to undercut the heat. This one's pretty
442.319,445.51,"hearty, you know. Oo."
447.84,451.029,"Oh, Sean."
451.039,453.749,"I know it's another level, but we're"
453.759,455.749,"here. Yeah, we got this. I've been"
455.759,458.469,"dealing lately with a lot of high fever,"
458.479,460.87,"you know, allergies. Yeah. From this"
460.88,462.07,kind of clears them out. I know. Where
462.08,464.23,were they when I needed them last week?
464.24,467.029,"I was really congested and now I'm like,"
467.039,468.55,"look at this. Yeah. Well, now you know"
468.56,470.309,you have this tool in the kit should you
470.319,471.749,ever need it again. All right. and we're
471.759,473.27,"giving you the sauces to go, so you'll"
473.28,476.23,have Yeah. your own medicine bag. Okay.
476.24,478.07,Can you talk me through the level of
478.08,480.629,detail that went into putting together
480.639,482.469,the scene in Knives Out where you puke
482.479,484.629,"on Chris Evans's face? Like, is it true"
484.639,487.029,that you and director Ryan Johnson
487.039,488.869,experimented with different kinds of
488.879,491.11,baby food to see which projectile had
491.12,493.029,like the longest shot in the air and
493.039,495.11,"what looked best on camera? Yes, it is"
495.12,497.43,"true. We had to, you know, we had the"
497.44,500.71,props guys like having like different
500.72,503.029,textures and mixes in different cups and
503.039,504.869,we went outside the house while they
504.879,507.51,were lighting the room and I was just
507.52,509.749,with Ryan out there and crazy. Pretty
509.759,512.469,much everyone came out just to see it
512.479,514.63,"was an event. Yeah, it was an event and"
514.64,516.63,we needed like on Chris's face like
516.64,519.75,really well. So we did one that had like
519.76,521.43,was kind of chunky. Yeah. Yeah. You want
521.44,523.99,to be authentic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Real
524.0,525.509,"to the floor, you know. He's so"
525.519,528.47,handsome. We wanted to like really Yeah.
528.48,529.62,mess with
533.959,539.75,him. I feel good.
539.76,542.23,"Right. So, how are you feeling? I'm okay"
542.24,546.47,"if you're okay. You know,"
546.48,547.829,"but this one to me, it's like, you know"
547.839,550.23,how we had this tropical one at number
550.24,551.509,"one that you're like, ""Oh, it's so"
551.519,553.59,"nice."" This has that tropical vibe, but"
553.6,556.63,then it has that I know. They all they
556.64,558.63,all take like a little minute to like
558.64,561.75,really come alive. Yep. Yeah.
561.76,563.43,"So, through your career so far, you've"
563.44,565.269,gained admiration and support from some
565.279,566.87,true heavy hitters in Hollywood. From
566.88,569.67,Robert Dairo to Daniel Craig to Keano
569.68,571.509,"Reeves. What, if anything, have you"
571.519,573.03,learned from them about what it means to
573.04,574.79,be number one on the call sheet? the way
574.8,576.23,that they command a set when they have
576.24,580.15,"that distinction. You know, going to LA"
580.16,582.63,or going to Hollywood was never a plan
582.64,584.87,for me. I moved to Spain and then from
584.88,586.87,"Spain to LA, but it was it was just kind"
586.88,589.509,of happening naturally. I just never
589.519,592.389,planned on it. And to be on set with
592.399,595.43,them was always uh kind of like a pinch
595.44,597.59,me moment every time. And I've worked
597.6,600.47,"with Yeah. Like you said, really, really"
600.48,603.91,amazing people. The project becomes the
603.92,605.91,project because of the people in them
605.92,608.23,and the way they collaborate and they
608.24,610.47,lead by example.
610.48,613.389,"This one, right? Yeah. It's called"
613.399,615.75,Apricot. Emphasis on the hot. Is that
615.76,617.509,the one you were warning me about? No.
617.519,619.43,"No, not yet. That'll be the next one."
619.44,620.63,But let's take our wins where we get
620.64,622.61,"them here, you know."
624.32,634.47,"Oh, I don't like this. Oh."
634.48,636.87,What is it? It's almost like a spicy
636.88,639.11,lemon to me when I bite into it. You
639.12,641.11,"know, like it has a citrus quality to"
641.12,644.87,"it, but then it contends with that"
644.88,646.55,"spice. Yeah. A little sour, little"
646.56,653.91,"spice, right? Puts us in that mode."
653.92,655.75,"So, when you're watching your own"
655.76,657.99,"performance, is there a technical aspect"
658.0,659.509,that you're always critiquing of
659.519,661.03,yourself or that you're trying to take
661.04,662.71,"to the next level? Like, when you watch"
662.72,664.63,"yourself, when are you your own biggest"
664.64,666.79,critic? I hate watching myself. I have
666.8,668.71,"to say,"
668.72,671.91,what was the question?
671.92,673.59,I'm curious like when you watch
673.6,675.43,"yourself, what are your own biggest"
675.44,678.55,"critic? Yeah. So, yeah, I'm uh that also"
678.56,680.31,that that that goes all the way through
680.32,682.63,"to the end. So, I start seeing early"
682.64,685.67,"cuts of the film. So, I've kind of like"
685.68,688.63,got gotten better at watching myself and
688.64,692.389,like trying to like separate myself from
692.399,695.35,from my performance alone and just look
695.36,697.75,"at the whole thing, the whole picture"
697.76,699.269,and what what's good for the film
699.279,702.069,"sometimes, you know, it's not what"
702.079,704.15,"selfishly you would want to, you know,"
704.16,707.509,for yourself. I'm very perfectionist and
707.519,709.509,"I like things, you know, they can always"
709.519,712.23,be improved. They can always be better.
712.24,715.43,"Is the one. Yeah, you know too much."
715.44,722.63,This is the bomb beyond insanity.
725.72,733.829,Okay. My bomb. Mhm.
733.839,736.43,Scott beyond insanity. Oh my
736.44,741.43,"god. Sean, this is bad. Yeah,"
741.44,744.79,I know that look. I know that look. Who
744.8,746.31,put me here? Who volunteered me for
747.839,753.31,Oh my god. I know. I
753.32,755.91,know. But this is as bad as it gets.
755.92,759.67,"Okay. Well,"
759.68,762.069,so I understand that in preparation for
762.079,763.59,your role as Marilyn Monroe and Blonde
763.6,764.949,that you watched her filmography
764.959,767.59,hundreds of times. Do you have a Mount
767.6,770.23,Rushmore of Marilyn Monroe movies? Like
770.24,772.23,four movies that you'd recommend to
772.24,773.75,maybe people in the audience who only
773.76,775.509,have a casual awareness of her career in
775.519,780.629,acting? Oh my gosh.
780.639,782.629,"What is this? I know. It's, you know,"
782.639,784.829,just a habanero
784.839,791.11,pepper that's concentrated.
791.12,795.43,"Oh, no. I know."
795.44,796.949,We could only laugh through the pain of
796.959,801.949,it all.
801.959,806.269,"Bro, please help."
806.279,809.47,"Um, definitely."
809.48,817.269,"Um, some like it hot. A classic."
817.279,821.11,Some Like it hot. It's really amazing.
821.12,824.15,She's wonderful in it. I love the prince
824.16,826.87,on the show girl. She's so relaxed and
826.88,828.87,you can see her like really enjoying
828.88,831.19,that character. Niagara is another
831.2,833.829,classic that I really loved. Jennal
