0,5,Oh my gosh .
5,10,What is this ?
10,15,"Hey , what 's going on everybody for First We F East . I 'm"
15,20,Sean Evans and you 're watching Hot Ones . It 's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings . And today we 're
20,25,"joined by Anna De Armis . She 's a Golden Globe and Oscar award nominated actress , you know , from films like Knives Out , Blonde , No"
25,30,"Time To Die , and many more . Her latest project though is a starring role in the fifth film of the John Wick franchise . It 's"
30,35,"called Ballerina and it 's set to release in theaters on June 6th . Anna de Armis ,"
35,40,welcome to the show . Thank you . How are you with spicy food before we get started ?
40,45,I I 'm not good at all . Like I I honestly I knew this was happening and I have been
45,50,practicing a little bit but not ready .
65,70,"Yeah , let 's do it ."
70,75,"Okay , here we go ."
75,80,"Well , this is good . Oh , I like it . I 'm doing"
80,85,good . This is great .
85,90,"It 's yummy . So , the John Wick franchise is"
90,95,"iconic for its imaginative use of violence . And not to give too much away , but I particularly"
95,100,enjoyed the Icegate Massacre and the flamethrower duel . What are the creative conversations
100,105,"like in shaping a character like Eve 's fighting style ? Like , were there any interesting chats about how to"
105,110,"tailor the signature John Wick choreography to the skills of a ballerina turned assassin ? Yeah ,"
110,115,I mean I think we wanted to just keep pushing the humor in the
115,120,franchise . You know that you watch the John Wick films and sometimes the fights are really intense and
120,125,"gory , but it 's the kind of action that you 're just having so much fun with . Like you put your fingers"
125,130,"in in your on your face , but you 're looking through you ca n't stop it . And also"
130,135,like adding the val ballet element to it was really important . Like I really
135,140,wanted to like see her . She 's a woman in the men 's world and I
140,145,"wanted to feel like every punch , every kick , everything was hurting . Like I"
145,150,really wanted her to go through that pain . Kind of reminds me of the experience of doing Hot
150,155,Ones . You know what I mean ? Like there 's a certain pain that you just become familiar with . You know what I
155,160,mean ? And that always allows you to push through cuz you know on the other side you 'll be fine . Yeah . All
160,165,"right , Anna , you 're doing great . Okay . Are you ready to move on here to sauce number two ? Number"
165,170,two . All right . So up next we have just winging it .
180,185,Still good . Yeah .
185,190,There we go . So recently the Academy Awards announced a new category
190,195,to recognize achievement in stunt design . Mhm . M if you were in charge of the criteria for
195,200,"that award , what do you think are like the most important things to focus on ? Like are there elements of best of"
200,205,the best Hollywood action sequences in your opinion ? I think yes . I would say like
205,210,feeling like it 's a one like you know like a one continuous shot . That would be
210,215,cool . That 's important to to feel like you 're in the moment .
215,220,"Um so definitely no cuts . No cuts . No cuts . Um , I would say"
220,225,"just being original , like doing things that you have n't seen before ,"
225,230,"like surprising people . What else ? What am I missing ? I You know what ? To me , you nailed it . That"
230,235,"was you just pulling an arrow , hitting a bullseye . Right . Y those two things . Yep . How are you"
235,240,doing so far ? I 'm good . I 'm I 'm good . Woo . I like that .
240,245,From nervous to confident . I can see it already . It 's not going to go well .
245,250,I
250,255,"'m ready . So , lately we 've been in the habit of"
255,260,asking actors about the scenes that they dreaded doing from the second they read them in the script to when
260,265,they saw it up on the call sheet scheduled . Yeah . What is it about the chaotic dinner
265,270,"scene in Eden , which I understand took 3 days to shoot , that made it one of the"
270,275,scariest things you 've ever done ? Singing . I hated it . I
275,280,"mean , I remember when I talked to Ron and I was like , "" Ron , I really"
280,285,"think I should lip- sync . Like , this is not for me . "" And he he just did n't want to hear it . He"
285,290,"was like , "" No , you 're singing . You 're singing . It 's , you know , if you do it bad , it 's good for the character . "" That 's what I 'm"
290,295,"like , "" Yeah , but people do n't know that . "" Um , so anyways , I I"
295,300,"just could n't I just could n't convince him to let me lip sync . So , I had to learn"
300,305,the song . It was horrible . I was terrified . I would rather do a
305,310,"hundred stunts than than sing song . Yeah , it was it was terrifying"
310,315,because also in front of all the actors and I just I do n't know . I just I just felt very exposed and
315,320,vulnerable and it 's not it 's not one of my talents for
320,325,sure .
325,330,Every time I 'm so nervous .
330,335,They 're messy . They are messy . And
335,340,"then just be careful around the eyes , you know . Yeah , I definitely do n't want this on my"
340,345,"eyes . So , in the Spanish class SNL skit that you did with Marcelo Hernandez and"
345,350,"Carol G , you rattle off a long list of Cuban foods , everything from rope vieja to"
350,355,"durrio , if you were to put together your last meal on earth Cuban style ,"
355,360,"what would that feast look like ? Like , what are the dishes that are most nostalgic to you ? Oo ,"
360,365,"Cuban food is just comfort food for me and it 's very basic , you know . It 's"
365,370,"it 's rice and beans . The black beans are my favorite . Um ,"
370,375,"definitely raka . Uh , the toston is the picadija is good ,"
375,380,too . It 's um minced meat in a in tomato sauce and with olives and all that is
380,385,like Cuban food is really well like condimented . It 's not spicy . You
385,390,say we 're condimented over here . No . No . but not this kind of uh spice . It 's
390,395,"spices , not spicy . So , it 's it 's just oh my gosh , I I"
395,400,love it . It 's so it 's so yummy . What would you say distinguishes a grape mojito
400,405,from a mediocre one ? I think it 's the the the how much sugar
405,410,you put it like it 's a fine line between making it like way too sweet and like
410,415,"just the right amount , you know , like um and the rum is important . You have"
415,420,to . It 's white rum Havana 3 . That 's what it is . You ca n't put anything else in it .
420,425,Rules to live by . Yes .
425,430,Oh my
430,435,"god . Would you like the mustard ? It 's all right . You know , I 'm kind of like you . I"
435,440,"kind of like the more citrusy Yeah . hot sauces . You know , like a little uh fruit to"
440,445,"undercut the heat . This one 's pretty hearty , you"
445,450,"know . Oo . Oh ,"
450,455,"Sean . I know it 's another level , but we 're here . Yeah , we got"
455,460,"this . I 've been dealing lately with a lot of high fever , you know , allergies ."
460,465,Yeah . From this kind of clears them out . I know . Where were they when I needed them last week ? I was
465,470,"really congested and now I 'm like , look at this . Yeah . Well , now you know you have this tool in the kit"
470,475,"should you ever need it again . All right . and we 're giving you the sauces to go , so you 'll have Yeah . your own"
475,480,medicine bag . Okay . Can you talk me through the level of detail that went into
480,485,"putting together the scene in Knives Out where you puke on Chris Evans 's face ? Like , is it true that"
485,490,you and director Ryan Johnson experimented with different kinds of baby food to see
490,495,"which projectile had like the longest shot in the air and what looked best on camera ? Yes , it"
495,500,"is true . We had to , you know , we had the props guys like having like"
500,505,different textures and mixes in different cups and we went outside the house while they
505,510,were lighting the room and I was just with Ryan out there and crazy . Pretty
510,515,"much everyone came out just to see it was an event . Yeah , it was an event and we"
515,520,needed like on Chris 's face like really well . So we did one that had like was
520,525,"kind of chunky . Yeah . Yeah . You want to be authentic . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Real to the floor , you"
525,530,know . He 's so handsome . We wanted to like really Yeah . mess with
535,540,him . I feel good .
540,545,"Right . So , how are you feeling ? I 'm okay if you 're okay ."
545,550,"You know , but this one to me , it 's like , you know how we had this tropical one at"
550,555,"number one that you 're like , "" Oh , it 's so nice . "" This has that tropical vibe , but then it has that"
555,560,I know . They all they all take like a little minute to like really
560,565,"come alive . Yep . Yeah . So , through your career so far , you 've gained admiration and support"
565,570,from some true heavy hitters in Hollywood . From Robert Dairo to Daniel Craig to Keano
570,575,"Reeves . What , if anything , have you learned from them about what it means to be number one on the call sheet ? the way that"
575,580,"they command a set when they have that distinction . You know , going to"
580,585,LA or going to Hollywood was never a plan for me . I moved to Spain and then from
585,590,"Spain to LA , but it was it was just kind of happening naturally . I just never"
590,595,planned on it . And to be on set with them was always uh kind of like a
595,600,"pinch me moment every time . And I 've worked with Yeah . Like you said , really ,"
600,605,really amazing people . The project becomes the project because of
605,610,the people in them and the way they collaborate and they lead by
610,615,"example . This one , right ? Yeah . It 's called Apricot . Emphasis on"
615,620,"the hot . Is that the one you were warning me about ? No . No , not yet . That 'll be the next one . But let 's take"
620,625,"our wins where we get them here , you know ."
625,630,"Oh , I do n't like this . Oh ."
630,635,What is
635,640,"it ? It 's almost like a spicy lemon to me when I bite into it . You know , like it"
640,645,"has a citrus quality to it , but then it contends with that"
645,650,"spice . Yeah . A little sour , little spice , right ?"
650,655,"Puts us in that mode . So , when you 're"
655,660,"watching your own performance , is there a technical aspect that you 're always critiquing of yourself or"
660,665,"that you 're trying to take to the next level ? Like , when you watch yourself , when are you your own biggest"
665,670,"critic ? I hate watching myself . I have to say , what was"
670,675,"the question ? I 'm curious like when you watch yourself , what are your own"
675,680,"biggest critic ? Yeah . So , yeah , I 'm uh that also that that that goes all the way"
680,685,"through to the end . So , I start seeing early cuts of the film . So , I 've"
685,690,kind of like got gotten better at watching myself and like trying to
690,695,like separate myself from from my performance alone and just
695,700,"look at the whole thing , the whole picture and what what 's good for the film"
700,705,"sometimes , you know , it 's not what selfishly you would want to , you know , for"
705,710,"yourself . I 'm very perfectionist and I like things , you know , they can always be"
710,715,"improved . They can always be better . Is the one . Yeah , you know too"
715,720,much . This is the bomb
720,725,beyond insanity .
725,730,Okay . My
730,735,bomb . Mhm . Scott
735,740,"beyond insanity . Oh my god . Sean , this is"
740,745,"bad . Yeah , I know that look . I know that look . Who put"
745,750,me here ? Who volunteered me for Oh my
750,755,god . I know . I know . But this is as
755,760,"bad as it gets . Okay . Well , so I"
760,765,understand that in preparation for your role as Marilyn Monroe and Blonde that you watched her filmography
765,770,hundreds of times . Do you have a Mount Rushmore of Marilyn Monroe movies ?
770,775,Like four movies that you 'd recommend to maybe people in the audience who only have a casual awareness of
775,780,her career in acting ? Oh my
780,785,"gosh . What is this ? I know . It 's , you know , just a habanero"
785,790,pepper that 's concentrated .
790,795,"Oh , no . I"
795,800,know . We could only laugh through the pain of it
800,805,"all . Bro , please"
805,810,"help . Um , definitely ."
810,815,"Um , some like it hot . A classic ."
815,820,Some Like it hot . It 's
820,825,really amazing . She 's wonderful in it . I love the prince on the show
825,830,girl . She 's so relaxed and you can see her like really enjoying that character .
830,835,Niagara is another classic that I really loved . Jennal prefer blondes .
835,840,Those are that 's a good one . And then be careful . Be careful . It kind of
840,845,"like went away , you know . Yeah . Yeah . fight . But the problem"
845,850,"with this show is , you know , the storm clears , the clouds break , the sunshine"
850,855,"comes in , and then more dark clouds start"
855,860,rolling in . What are you telling me ? That there are two more to
860,865,"go . Oh my god , that was so bad . You can keep that"
865,870,one . I do n't want it .
875,880,I 'm just numbed . This is
880,885,"good . You like it ? No , I mean it 's good that I 'm numb . It 's"
885,890,good . Yeah . Great . As someone who 's had a big acting career both here and
890,895,"abroad , I 'm curious . Is there a abroad , I 'm curious . Is there a difference between like a Spanish movie going audience and American"
895,900,moviegoing audience ? Like is there any difference in like what somebody who buys a movie ticket in
900,905,Madrid is looking for versus someone in LA ? The influence of
905,910,American cinema in in Europe is more um is a is stronger I
910,915,say . Uh and Europeans like European films for the you know
915,920,like it 's it 's a kind of like um you can not
920,925,"do that . Be careful . No . Um , I think Europeans also or"
925,930,Spanish people have a a pretty wide um spectrum of of
930,935,"they they know about cinema , right ? You know , and they they have they have"
935,940,"good taste , you know . Yeah . All right , Anna . This is"
940,945,it .
945,950,"You do n't have to if you do n't want to . Ah , you"

955,960,say that to me . I love it .

980,985,"go . And with that , Anna de"
985,990,"Armis , you have run the Hot Ones gauntlet . And just one more question before we get you"
990,995,"out of here . And you know , my favorite thing about watching the John Wick films is the use"
995,1000,of practical everyday objects in fight sequences . Looking around
1000,1005,"right now , if you were to storyboard out a combat scene , how might you use what 's here"
1005,1010,"in the studio to your advantage ? Um ,"
1010,1015,"well , I would definitely get this bottle ,"
1015,1020,"break it , and I think I would just like , you know , um ,"
1020,1025,"make sure you 're close to me , like on the table . Mhm . So , I would just"
1025,1030,probably smash your head on the table on top of the sauce and the glass . The shards of
1030,1035,"glass . Well , you know what ? That right there sounds like it 's worth the price of admission ."
1035,1040,"And look at you , Anna de Armas , taking on the wings of death , looking to tell the tale , and now"
1040,1045,"there 's nothing left to do but roll out the red carpet for you . This camera , this camera , or this camera ? Let the people know what you"
