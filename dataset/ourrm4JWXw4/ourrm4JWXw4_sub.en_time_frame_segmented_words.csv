0,5,"Hello friends , it 's me and today we are checking out some very unlucky"
5,10,"people . She 's playing the claw machine game . Oh , she got it . Oh , by the foot . No ."
10,15,"Oh , it was so close . This be happen to me all the time . There is"
15,20,"nothing like a claw machine getting your hopes up just to be like , "" Oh , here you go ."
20,25,"Oh , here Mickey for you . Oh , no . No . No . Sorry . No Mickey . No toy . You"
25,30,"know , maybe if you give me $ 20 more dollars and 10 more tries , maybe , just maybe , you 'll be a"
30,35,"winner . Mom , I saw this really cool hack on YouTube where you put a ton of rubber bands on a"
35,40,"watermelon and then it 'll pop in half . Here , I did it . Why is n't it"
40,45,"working ? Yeah , that exploded . All right . You know , that melon was at its breaking point . I can no"
45,50,"longer handle this abuse . As you can see , it does"
50,55,"work , but you just do n't know when it will work . In the"
55,60,"whole entire animal kingdom , seagulls have got to be the rudest and most"
60,65,"unhinged . Like , people will just be at the beach minding their own business , eating , and"
65,70,they will fly down and they will swoop down and steal your snack right out of your
70,75,"mouth . They do n't care . Like , the way he low - key teaagged her too while stealing her"
75,80,"snack . Like , they 've been using their wings for evil . They 're evil thieves . See , I"
80,85,"'m telling you , they are the worst creatures . Look at this guy . He knew . He knew exactly what he"
85,90,was going to do . There was n't even food . She did n't even have any food . He went for the eyeball .
90,95,Watch this in slow motion . He thought there was food in
95,100,there . This is a violation . A molestation of her
100,105,eyeball . Bro went in there . I do n't like seagulls . I am very weary of
105,110,seagulls . Traumatized by the beard . This guy might have had the
110,115,"worst luck ever . This guy threw a basketball in a pipe . Oh , just barely"
115,120,"missed it . It 's going to hit his head . Ah , not the head I was talking about . Now , I 'm"
120,125,not even a guy and I can feel this video . My peanuts .
125,130,POV . When the lifeguard gets too cocky . Did you see him ? I have to
130,135,"go back . You know , when they do that flying kick , give you all that momentum . Bro brought himself"
135,140,"along , too . Like , it hit him a little too hard . Where is he ? Is he okay ? Is he coming down ? Bro"
140,145,'s probably not going to have a good time going down that with no floaty . Raw dog in the water
145,150,slide . I thought he was a professional at this . That was just
150,155,unlucky . A bad day at the job . First time for little Billy
155,160,going down the slide . How does that even happen ? There 's just
160,165,simply not enough traction . How 'd you get a concussion going down a
165,170,slide ? Poor kid probably never went on a slide again . Like what ? It 's supposed to be
170,175,"Oh , I 'm glad she was able to protect her"
175,180,"daughter in time , but Oh , I mean , what were y' all trying to do ? You try to hurt nature ,"
180,185,"nature will strike back . Ooh , that 's crazy how our mom instinct just kicked in ."
185,190,"Like , oh , protect my head . Wait , no . I have a child . Protect the child . And it"
190,195,"all happened so fast . You know , summer grandma go lay on the"
195,200,"I thought she was supposed to fit in the hole . Ah . So , when I was"
200,205,"growing up and we went to the grocery store , my parents would always test"
205,210,"the watermelon by smacking it . I never understood this . I always thought I I do n't know ,"
210,215,they 'd be smacking every melon in the box . And somehow they always brought home the
215,220,"perfect melon . But as an adult , I tried this and I started tapping all the melons to see"
220,225,"if there was something different about the sound . I could n't even tell you . But anyways , they brought"
225,230,home this melon that they thought had a good sound and it 's white . Where 's the
230,235,juice ? It 's glorious watermelon essence has been sucked dry . Or maybe he was
235,240,"picked from the patch a little too soon . Like , how does this even happen ? How do you end up getting the worst"
240,245,"melon in the batch ? She was confident , too . Tap on all of them like , "" Oh , yes , you . "" You know , there"
245,250,'s so many melon hacks . How do you determine which is a good melon ? Look for one that
250,255,"feels heavy , looks dull and not shiny , and potentially a sweet aroma . Bro , you got"
255,260,"it . I ai n't got time to smell each melon at the grocery store . Yellow spot means ready to eat . So ,"
260,265,"when you tap it , it 's to hear if there 's a hollow sound . That means it 's ready to eat . If it"
265,270,"'s a dull sound , then it 's not right . Now , we know how to choose our Malone . Congratulations . You are"
270,275,now a melon expert . Everybody 's worst fear came to life when this dude dropped his
275,280,"phone and it went in the great . But wait , it 's He got so lucky it did n't fall in . It 's that Popsocket"
280,285,"protecting him and his phone . Come on , pick it up . Just pick it up . No . Why would"
285,290,you do that ? Why would n't you pick it up from the phone and not the flimsy popsocket ? Good thing
290,295,"you got your Gojo bird popsocket back . Thank goodness we saved him . Now , who"
295,300,"needs the iPhone when you got this guy ? Oh , you only get one . Only one fell ."
300,305,There is no way . Y'all should have got all three of those for the price up here . You can be pulpy down
305,310,"there . Also , what is a pulpy ? It sounds very delicious . Fruit soda . Where I got to go to get me"
310,315,one of these . I have been to one one of these . I have been to one softball game all year and this happens .
315,320,"The ball went into the car window . Oh , but at least you get to keep the ball , right ? Right ."
320,325,"Trade offer . You get broken car window , but also free baseball . I do n't know . Depends on what"
325,330,"game it was from , but most likely not worth it . The battery in their car died ."
330,335,And then they left a note on their car . Battery died . We 'll be back at 2:30
335,340,"with cables and a friend to jump . Please do not tow the car . So , they did n't tow the car , but"
340,345,"they gave them a ticket . Like , bro , the car is dead . How do you expect me to move a dead car ?"
345,350,"Huh ? You ca n't park here . It 's like somebody getting into a car accident and getting a parking violation . Like , you ca"
350,355,n't park here . You ca n't park in the middle of the road . How irresponsible of you . Come on . Some people need a
355,360,"little bit of sympathy . Okay , can we talk about this ? This is the most annoying thing"
360,365,"with booking a flight . And I do n't know why this happens . Like , you go to book a flight ."
365,370,"Oh , the ticket is $ 98 . Okay , great . Wow . I 'm going to go take a shower , make"
370,375,"myself some dinner , and then I 'll buy my plane ticket for $ 98 . And then you"
375,380,refresh the page . And suddenly the price went from $ 98 to
380,385,"$ 1,600 . How ? Why ? Who ? Where ? What ? Because you"
385,390,know I 'm interested in this flight . You saw somebody on the internet
390,395,"looking up this exact flight . Oh , maybe two people are looking at the same flight at the same time . Let 's"
395,400,quadruple the price just for funsies . I hate how the algorithm works . I I do n't
400,405,"understand . It 's like the first time you see a flight , you have to do it in a private window or I"
405,410,"literally bought a VPN just for this specific reason . So , they"
410,415,"stopped doing this to me . I tried to book a flight today . Today , today"
415,420,I tried to book a flight . I got the price . I put in all my credit card information and everything . I
420,425,"pressed place order . Sorry , order did n't go through because the price went up . I 'm like , I"
425,430,"searched the flight , bought it 5 minutes ago . How does it double in 5 minutes ? And"
430,435,"so I was like , okay , I really , really , really need this flight . It 's the only flight"
435,440,"left . Fine . It did it again 7 minutes ago . I was buying a $ 1,000 flight and"
440,445,"now it is 2,700 . I did n't buy it . I 'm not playing this game . This This is n't fair . I know"
445,450,"it 's the way algorithms work , but have you thought maybe I just wo n't buy the flight ? Maybe I just wo n't go on my trip ."
450,455,You have deterred me . Your price gouging has deterred me from even leaving my house . You know what ? I 'm good here . I do
455,460,n't want to travel anyway . When you accidentally take someone else 's bag from the airport
460,465,on the first day of your vacation . Uh - oh . This is a nightmare . My
465,470,mom accidentally did this once and the guy also took her bag and he
470,475,"refused to meet halfway . So , she had to take an hourong Uber to"
475,480,"get to his hotel and trade . It was a man . He was like , "" Well , I do n't care . I 'm in no"
480,485,"rush for my bag . I do n't need to brush rush for my bag . I do n't need to brush my teeth tonight . "" If you have a black luggage or a luggage that"
485,490,"looks like everybody else 's , put a sticker on it . Put a keychain . Put something identifiable"
490,495,because not everybody is going to read the little tag . And some people will have the exact same
495,500,"luggage as you . It just makes life so much easier . So , I got a mint green luggage . Nobody else is"
500,505,going to have mint green and never lose it . Remembering the time I got a prize too big for
505,510,"my car ? Yo , what a problem to have . I have never been able to win one of these"
510,515,"ginormous monkeys from the fair . How How does anybody win one of these ? You know , thank"
515,520,"goodness we have chat GPT for all of life 's questions . Like , I 've only ever won very small"
520,525,prizes . How many water gun races do you have to win to get the biggest monkey of them all ?
525,530,That 's one of my favorite games because there 's always a winner . All you got to do is lock in and beat five
530,535,"other drunkies and kids . Like the water gun match . Easiest fair game . Okay , but how do you get him"
535,540,home ? Stuff him in the back seat . He 's a plushy . He 's smooshable . Put him in the trunk like a
540,545,"little prisoner . No , do n't do that . I 'll sit in the trunk . He can ride in the front seat . Thinking about"
545,550,that time I bleached my hair and it started falling off . And no one told me until my
550,555,"boyfriend took photos of me at Disneyland . Oh , it took me a hot second . I was like"
555,560,"looking for a bald spot up here , but literally half of it fell out . How do you"
560,565,"not feel that ? That did happen to me when I bleached my hair though . Like some people , we ca n't handle a"
565,570,"bleaching . It literally snaps off and falls out . I 'm sorry , but you got some fake friends if they wo n't tell you that your"
570,575,hair is literally falling out . It 's just like getting the chicken out of the freezer and you got to wait for it
575,580,to thaw . I guess I 'll be driving again in the spring if the car even works after that .
580,585,These workers just laid some fresh concrete . And this woman walks through
585,590,"ruining the concrete , leaving her footsteps . Oh , I wonder why the sidewalk is so sticky . It 's"
590,595,"getting real hard to pick up my feet . Are n't they going to say anything ? Like , bro , there 's wet"
595,600,"concrete . Perhaps a do not walk sign or a hey , stop . You shall not"
600,605,"pass . No , let do her thing . She 's pass . No , let do her thing . She 's probably wondering why the floor 's so sticky . like , "" Oh , this"
605,610,"little alleyway is a little shortcut to get home . "" I do n't think the shortcut was worth it . This"
610,615,"poor dog swallowed a light up toy . And now when he goes to poop , it just"
615,620,lights up like a Christmas tree and everybody can see . And that poor
620,625,"thing , he has no idea that everybody could see that he swallowed it and is lighting up"
625,630,like a Christmas tree . Oh no . It 's so
630,635,"shameful . Oh no . This girl paid over $ 1,000"
635,640,for a designer to make her a custom wedding dress . And they ended up sending her a $ 50 dress from
640,645,"Teeu . I do n't know what they were trying to do , but that dress is not it . I feel bad . I would"
645,650,"be crying , too . Like , girl , you better get a refund ASAP . I do n't know what this is . This is not a prom"
650,655,"dress . I do n't even know what this is . Like , what were they even trying to do ? I think the worst part is that"
655,660,"she got it the day of prom , expecting this amazing , beautiful designer dress and"
660,665,then getting DIY trash from Teeu . I really hate scammers . They scammed
665,670,"her so bad . I hate people who scam . But anyways , that 's all for today . I hope you guys enjoyed this"
