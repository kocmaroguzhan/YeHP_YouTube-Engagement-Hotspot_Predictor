0.16,2.8689999999999998,"Hello friends, it's me and today we are"
2.879,5.269,checking out some very unlucky people.
5.279,7.43,"She's playing the claw machine game. Oh,"
7.44,10.31,"she got it. Oh, by the foot. No. Oh, it"
10.32,11.79,was so
11.8,14.07,close. This be happen to me all the
14.08,15.99,time. There is nothing like a claw
16.0,18.39,machine getting your hopes up just to be
18.4,21.189,"like, ""Oh, here you go. Oh, here Mickey"
21.199,23.83,"for you. Oh, no. No. No. Sorry. No"
23.84,25.91,"Mickey. No toy. You know, maybe if you"
25.92,27.83,give me $20 more dollars and 10 more
27.84,29.75,"tries, maybe, just maybe, you'll be a"
29.76,31.99,"winner. Mom, I saw this really cool hack"
32.0,34.229,on YouTube where you put a ton of rubber
34.239,36.549,bands on a watermelon and then it'll pop
36.559,39.869,"in half. Here, I did it. Why isn't it"
39.879,42.549,"working? Yeah, that exploded. All right."
42.559,44.15,"You know, that melon was at its breaking"
44.16,45.91,point. I can no longer handle this
45.92,48.52,"abuse. As you can see, it does"
51.32,53.83,"work, but you just don't know when it"
53.84,55.91,will work. In the whole entire animal
55.92,58.47,"kingdom, seagulls have got to be the"
58.48,61.189,"rudest and most unhinged. Like, people"
61.199,63.189,will just be at the beach minding their
63.199,65.59,"own business, eating, and they will fly"
65.6,68.149,down and they will swoop down and steal
68.159,70.31,your snack right out of your mouth. They
70.32,72.23,"don't care. Like, the way he low-key"
72.24,74.789,teaagged her too while stealing her
74.799,76.31,"snack. Like, they've been using their"
76.32,78.99,wings for evil. They're evil
79.0,81.429,"thieves. See, I'm telling you, they are"
81.439,83.429,the worst creatures. Look at this guy.
83.439,85.109,He knew. He knew exactly what he was
85.119,86.55,going to do. There wasn't even food. She
86.56,88.55,didn't even have any food. He went for
88.56,91.59,the eyeball. Watch this in slow motion.
91.6,94.67,He thought there was food in
94.68,97.95,there. This is a violation. A
97.96,101.27,molestation of her eyeball. Bro went in
101.28,103.99,there. I don't like seagulls. I am very
104.0,106.91,weary of seagulls. Traumatized by the
106.92,110.389,beard. This guy might have had the worst
110.399,113.35,luck ever. This guy threw a basketball
113.36,115.429,"in a pipe. Oh, just barely missed it."
115.439,117.35,"It's going to hit his head. Ah, not the"
117.36,118.749,head I was talking
118.759,121.83,"about. Now, I'm not even a guy and I can"
121.84,125.59,feel this video. My peanuts. POV. When
125.6,127.469,the lifeguard gets too
127.479,130.15,cocky. Did you see him? I have to go
130.16,131.83,"back. You know, when they do that flying"
131.84,133.83,"kick, give you all that momentum. Bro"
133.84,136.07,"brought himself along, too. Like, it hit"
136.08,138.15,him a little too hard. Where is he? Is
138.16,140.07,he okay? Is he coming down? Bro's
140.08,141.35,probably not going to have a good time
141.36,144.15,going down that with no floaty. Raw dog
144.16,146.309,in the water slide. I thought he was a
146.319,148.35,professional at
148.36,151.35,this. That was just unlucky. A bad day
151.36,153.99,at the job. First time for little Billy
154.0,156.67,going down the
156.68,159.03,slide. How does that even happen?
159.04,161.07,There's just simply not enough
161.08,163.11,traction. How'd you get a concussion
163.12,165.509,going down a slide?
165.519,167.19,Poor kid probably never went on a slide
167.2,168.71,again. Like what? It's supposed to be
172.16,174.63,"Oh, I'm glad she was able to protect her"
174.64,177.03,"daughter in time, but Oh, I mean, what"
177.04,179.27,were y'all trying to do? You try to hurt
179.28,182.07,"nature, nature will strike back. Ooh,"
182.08,184.229,that's crazy how our mom instinct just
184.239,186.47,"kicked in. Like, oh, protect my head."
186.48,188.71,"Wait, no. I have a child. Protect the"
188.72,192.149,child. And it all happened so fast. You
192.159,193.99,"know, summer grandma go lay on the"
196.08,198.07,I thought she was supposed to fit in the
198.08,201.35,"hole. Ah. So, when I was growing up and"
201.36,203.75,"we went to the grocery store, my parents"
203.76,206.229,would always test the watermelon by
206.239,208.71,smacking it. I never understood this. I
208.72,210.39,"always thought I I don't know, they'd be"
210.4,212.47,smacking every melon in the box. And
212.48,214.63,somehow they always brought home the
214.64,217.35,"perfect melon. But as an adult, I tried"
217.36,219.27,this and I started tapping all the
219.28,221.11,melons to see if there was something
221.12,223.43,different about the sound. I couldn't
223.44,224.789,"even tell you. But anyways, they brought"
224.799,227.19,home this melon that they thought had a
227.2,229.91,good sound and it's white. Where's the
229.92,232.55,juice? It's glorious watermelon essence
232.56,234.869,has been sucked dry. Or maybe he was
234.879,236.949,picked from the patch a little too soon.
236.959,238.47,"Like, how does this even happen? How do"
238.48,240.309,you end up getting the worst melon in
240.319,242.229,"the batch? She was confident, too. Tap"
242.239,244.229,"on all of them like, ""Oh, yes, you."" You"
244.239,246.63,"know, there's so many melon hacks. How"
246.64,248.71,do you determine which is a good melon?
248.72,250.869,"Look for one that feels heavy, looks"
250.879,253.75,"dull and not shiny, and potentially a"
253.76,255.509,"sweet aroma. Bro, you got it. I ain't"
255.519,257.189,got time to smell each melon at the
257.199,259.27,grocery store. Yellow spot means ready
259.28,261.509,"to eat. So, when you tap it, it's to"
261.519,263.51,hear if there's a hollow sound. That
263.52,265.35,means it's ready to eat. If it's a dull
265.36,267.27,"sound, then it's not right. Now, we know"
267.28,268.55,how to choose our Malone.
268.56,270.39,Congratulations. You are now a melon
270.4,273.11,expert. Everybody's worst fear came to
273.12,275.03,life when this dude dropped his phone
275.04,276.87,"and it went in the great. But wait, it's"
276.88,278.71,He got so lucky it didn't fall in. It's
278.72,280.55,that Popsocket protecting him and his
280.56,281.99,"phone. Come on, pick it up. Just pick it"
282.0,284.469,up. No.
284.479,286.23,Why would you do that? Why wouldn't you
286.24,287.99,pick it up from the phone and not the
288.0,290.31,flimsy popsocket? Good thing you got
290.32,293.03,your Gojo bird popsocket back. Thank
293.04,295.03,"goodness we saved him. Now, who needs"
295.04,297.189,"the iPhone when you got this guy? Oh,"
297.199,300.15,you only get one. Only one fell. There
300.16,302.15,is no way. Y'all should have got all
302.16,303.83,three of those for the price up here.
303.84,305.749,"You can be pulpy down there. Also, what"
305.759,308.23,is a pulpy? It sounds very delicious.
308.24,309.99,Fruit soda. Where I got to go to get me
310.0,312.07,one of these. I have been to one
312.08,314.95,softball game all year and this happens.
314.96,317.43,"The ball went into the car window. Oh,"
317.44,319.029,"but at least you get to keep the ball,"
319.039,321.27,right? Right. Trade offer. You get
321.28,323.35,"broken car window, but also free"
323.36,324.95,baseball. I don't know. Depends on what
324.96,327.43,"game it was from, but most likely not"
327.44,329.749,worth it. The battery in their car died.
329.759,332.31,And then they left a note on their car.
332.32,335.189,Battery died. We'll be back at 2:30 with
335.199,337.43,cables and a friend to jump. Please do
337.44,339.27,"not tow the car. So, they didn't tow the"
339.28,341.59,"car, but they gave them a ticket. Like,"
341.6,343.43,"bro, the car is dead. How do you expect"
343.44,345.749,me to move a dead car? Huh? You can't
345.759,347.189,park here. It's like somebody getting
347.199,348.71,into a car accident and getting a
348.72,350.23,"parking violation. Like, you can't park"
350.24,351.43,here. You can't park in the middle of
351.44,353.909,the road. How irresponsible of you. Come
353.919,355.43,on. Some people need a little bit of
355.44,357.67,"sympathy. Okay, can we talk about this?"
357.68,360.31,This is the most annoying thing with
360.32,362.31,booking a flight. And I don't know why
362.32,364.23,"this happens. Like, you go to book a"
364.24,367.51,"flight. Oh, the ticket is $98. Okay,"
367.52,369.35,great. Wow. I'm going to go take a
369.36,371.189,"shower, make myself some dinner, and"
371.199,373.99,then I'll buy my plane ticket for $98.
374.0,375.83,And then you refresh the page. And
375.84,379.87,suddenly the price went from $98 to
379.88,384.309,"$1,600. How? Why? Who? Where? What?"
384.319,386.55,Because you know I'm interested in this
386.56,389.51,flight. You saw somebody on the internet
389.52,391.909,"looking up this exact flight. Oh, maybe"
391.919,393.35,two people are looking at the same
393.36,395.51,flight at the same time. Let's quadruple
395.52,397.99,the price just for funsies. I hate how
398.0,399.83,the algorithm works. I I don't
399.84,402.15,understand. It's like the first time you
402.16,403.51,"see a flight, you have to do it in a"
403.52,406.469,private window or I literally bought a
406.479,409.51,"VPN just for this specific reason. So,"
409.52,411.59,they stopped doing this to me. I tried
411.6,415.11,"to book a flight today. Today, today I"
415.12,417.11,tried to book a flight. I got the price.
417.12,418.71,I put in all my credit card information
418.72,420.79,and everything. I pressed place order.
420.8,422.79,"Sorry, order didn't go through because"
422.8,425.35,"the price went up. I'm like, I searched"
425.36,427.99,"the flight, bought it 5 minutes ago. How"
428.0,430.23,does it double in 5 minutes? And so I
430.24,432.71,"was like, okay, I really, really, really"
432.72,434.79,need this flight. It's the only flight
434.8,437.27,left. Fine. It did it again 7 minutes
437.28,439.67,"ago. I was buying a $1,000 flight and"
439.68,442.629,"now it is 2,700. I didn't buy it. I'm"
442.639,444.39,not playing this game. This This isn't
444.4,446.23,fair. I know it's the way algorithms
446.24,447.749,"work, but have you thought maybe I just"
447.759,449.189,won't buy the flight? Maybe I just won't
449.199,450.87,go on my trip. You have deterred me.
450.88,452.71,Your price gouging has deterred me from
452.72,454.23,even leaving my house. You know what?
454.24,455.67,I'm good here. I don't want to travel
455.68,457.83,anyway. When you accidentally take
457.84,460.07,someone else's bag from the airport on
460.08,463.35,the first day of your vacation. Uh-oh.
463.36,466.309,This is a nightmare. My mom accidentally
466.319,468.79,did this once and the guy also took her
468.8,472.39,"bag and he refused to meet halfway. So,"
472.4,475.189,she had to take an hourong Uber to get
475.199,477.99,to his hotel and trade. It was a man. He
478.0,479.99,"was like, ""Well, I don't care. I'm in no"
480.0,481.83,rush for my bag. I don't need to brush
481.84,483.99,"my teeth tonight."" If you have a black"
484.0,485.35,luggage or a luggage that looks like
485.36,486.95,"everybody else's, put a sticker on it."
486.96,489.189,Put a keychain. Put something
489.199,491.189,identifiable because not everybody is
491.199,493.189,going to read the little tag. And some
493.199,495.189,people will have the exact same luggage
495.199,496.71,as you. It just makes life so much
496.72,499.189,"easier. So, I got a mint green luggage."
499.199,500.79,Nobody else is going to have mint green
500.8,502.869,and never lose it. Remembering the time
502.879,505.51,"I got a prize too big for my car? Yo,"
505.52,507.749,what a problem to have. I have never
507.759,510.23,been able to win one of these ginormous
510.24,512.87,monkeys from the fair. How How does
512.88,514.55,"anybody win one of these? You know,"
514.56,516.469,thank goodness we have chat GPT for all
516.479,518.469,"of life's questions. Like, I've only"
518.479,520.949,ever won very small prizes. How many
520.959,522.949,water gun races do you have to win to
522.959,524.87,get the biggest monkey of them all?
524.88,526.47,That's one of my favorite games because
526.48,528.31,there's always a winner. All you got to
528.32,530.389,do is lock in and beat five other
530.399,532.47,drunkies and kids. Like the water gun
532.48,534.389,"match. Easiest fair game. Okay, but how"
534.399,535.829,do you get him home? Stuff him in the
535.839,537.829,back seat. He's a plushy. He's
537.839,539.59,smooshable. Put him in the trunk like a
539.6,542.31,"little prisoner. No, don't do that. I'll"
542.32,543.509,sit in the trunk. He can ride in the
543.519,545.509,front seat. Thinking about that time I
545.519,547.269,bleached my hair and it started falling
547.279,549.43,off. And no one told me until my
549.44,551.31,boyfriend took photos of me at
551.32,553.91,"Disneyland. Oh, it took me a hot second."
553.92,556.07,I was like looking for a bald spot up
556.08,559.35,"here, but literally half of it fell out."
559.36,561.11,How do you not feel that? That did
561.12,562.47,happen to me when I bleached my hair
562.48,564.07,"though. Like some people, we can't"
564.08,566.23,handle a bleaching. It literally snaps
566.24,568.07,"off and falls out. I'm sorry, but you"
568.08,569.43,got some fake friends if they won't tell
569.44,570.79,you that your hair is literally falling
570.8,572.55,out. It's just like getting the chicken
572.56,574.55,out of the freezer and you got to wait
574.56,576.71,for it to thaw. I guess I'll be driving
576.72,578.63,again in the spring if the car even
578.64,581.11,works after that. These workers just
581.12,583.67,laid some fresh concrete. And this woman
583.68,586.15,"walks through ruining the concrete,"
586.16,588.31,"leaving her footsteps. Oh, I wonder why"
588.32,590.47,the sidewalk is so sticky. It's getting
590.48,591.99,real hard to pick up my feet. Aren't
592.0,593.75,"they going to say anything? Like, bro,"
593.76,596.389,there's wet concrete. Perhaps a do not
596.399,599.99,"walk sign or a hey, stop. You shall not"
600.0,602.389,"pass. No, let do her thing. She's"
602.399,603.75,probably wondering why the floor's so
603.76,605.509,"sticky. like, ""Oh, this little alleyway"
605.519,607.19,"is a little shortcut to get home."" I"
607.2,609.19,don't think the shortcut was worth it.
609.2,612.55,This poor dog swallowed a light up toy.
612.56,614.79,"And now when he goes to poop, it just"
614.8,616.949,lights up like a Christmas tree and
616.959,620.15,"everybody can see. And that poor thing,"
620.16,622.55,he has no idea that everybody could see
622.56,624.71,that he swallowed it and is lighting up
624.72,628.67,like a Christmas tree. Oh no. It's so
628.68,632.47,shameful. Oh no.
632.48,635.11,"This girl paid over $1,000 for a"
635.12,636.79,designer to make her a custom wedding
636.8,638.949,dress. And they ended up sending her a
638.959,641.43,$50 dress from Teeu. I don't know what
641.44,642.949,"they were trying to do, but that dress"
642.959,645.19,is not it. I feel bad. I would be
645.2,647.03,"crying, too. Like, girl, you better get"
647.04,648.949,a refund ASAP. I don't know what this
648.959,650.63,is. This is not a prom dress. I don't
650.64,651.829,"even know what this is. Like, what were"
651.839,653.67,they even trying to do? I think the
653.68,656.23,worst part is that she got it the day of
656.24,658.63,"prom, expecting this amazing, beautiful"
658.64,660.79,designer dress and then getting DIY
660.8,663.829,trash from Teeu. I really hate scammers.
663.839,666.55,They scammed her so bad. I hate people
666.56,668.79,"who scam. But anyways, that's all for"
668.8,669.99,today. I hope you guys enjoyed this
670.0,671.59,"video. If you did, make sure to hit that"
