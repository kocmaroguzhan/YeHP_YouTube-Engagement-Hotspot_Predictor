1422.72,1424.81,hello oh
1454.36,1456.43,uh wanted to update you guys a little
1456.44,1458.35,bit I talked about this before but I
1458.36,1459.95,thing that I've really struggled with
1459.96,1462.75,for the past year is the decision on
1462.76,1465.63,what we should do uh with staying in
1465.64,1468.029,Japan or uh moving back to Europe I
1468.039,1470.35,think especially now that we have bej I
1470.36,1472.07,kind of have to think about what's
1472.08,1475.87,better for uh everyone and uh in many
1475.88,1478.83,ways uh Japan makes no sense because
1478.84,1480.99,we're so far away from family we are far
1481.0,1483.07,away from friends that we miss back home
1483.08,1485.029,and uh it's just made it very difficult
1485.039,1487.789,because we we love living in Japan so
1487.799,1489.43,much I we didn't know what it was going
1489.44,1491.11,to be like before coming here just
1491.12,1492.389,trying to come up with a decision that's
1492.399,1494.99,been so difficult but we finally decided
1495.0,1496.99,and we decided that we're staying don't
1497.0,1500.43,know how long but for the future and I'm
1500.44,1502.11,just so happy that we finally made this
1502.12,1505.029,Choice it feels uh so liberating I don't
1505.039,1507.59,know how to explain the fact that like
1507.6,1509.35,it's just been in my head for so long
1509.36,1511.029,that I'm I'm just so excited and it just
1511.039,1513.63,feels right as well this is where we

1568.84,1570.43,would wait in line going through the
1570.44,1572.63,hassle of renting a Wi-Fi box having to
1572.64,1573.669,carry an extra thing when you're
1573.679,1575.71,traveling worrying if it's charged or
1575.72,1577.95,not going through swapping out Sims
1577.96,1580.11,worrying about losing your original Sim
1580.12,1582.43,all this stuff should not be a thing and
1582.44,1585.669,thanks to S it's no more s is an eim

1594.48,1595.75,and you're done so while people are
1595.76,1597.51,waiting in line to do all this extra
