1410,1415,Garden come D he 's fast
1420,1425,hello oh
1450,1455,uh wanted
1455,1460,to update you guys a little bit I talked about this before but I thing that I 've really struggled with
1460,1465,for the past year is the decision on what we should do uh with
1465,1470,staying in Japan or uh moving back to Europe I think especially now that we
1470,1475,have bej I kind of have to think about what 's better for uh everyone and
1475,1480,uh in many ways uh Japan makes no sense because we 're so far away
1480,1485,from family we are far away from friends that we miss back home and uh it 's just made it very
1485,1490,difficult because we we love living in Japan so much I we did n't know what it was going to be like
1490,1495,before coming here just trying to come up with a decision that 's been so difficult but we finally decided
1495,1500,and we decided that we 're staying do n't and we decided that we 're staying do n't know how long but for the future
1500,1505,and I 'm just so happy that we finally made this Choice it feels uh so liberating I do
1505,1510,n't know how to explain the fact that like it 's just been in my head for so long that I 'm I 'm
1510,1515,just so excited and it just feels right as well this is where we love to be uh I think it
1515,1520,will be great for be for the time being as well everyone jokes that he will have to learn four languages
1520,1525,but I guess that is true now for sure obviously it 's not going to be forever
1525,1530,but you ca n't really plan for that long anyway and Japan has just has been so
1530,1535,good to us and uh we we do n't feel ready to leave it yet cuz we really really love it here and I think it
1535,1540,shows in the Vlogs too it 's just endless of things to explore here and we love every day day to day even
1540,1545,when we do n't do stuff so also big thanks to everyone for supporting the Vlogs I 'm about
1545,1550,to cough looks like I 'm about to cry but I just my throat hurts I should go with it I 'm
1550,1555,crying so thank you guys for watching and uh yeah just want to let
1555,1560,you guys know we 've been traveling a lot in this Vlog and the one
1560,1565,thing that I always use when I travel is s s has made my life
1565,1570,while traveling 10 times better while you guys and me and myself in the past would wait in line going
1570,1575,through the hassle of renting a Wi - Fi box having to carry an extra thing when you 're traveling worrying if
1575,1580,it 's charged or not going through swapping out Sims worrying about losing your original
1580,1585,Sim all this stuff should not be a thing and thanks to S it 's no more s
1585,1590,is an eim that works in over 180 countries and the best part is you can sign up before you even
1590,1595,travel pick how much data you want to use and then do n't have to worry about it as soon as you land it connects and you 're
1595,1600,done so while people are waiting in line to do all this extra stuff that you do n't want to do when you 're tired after traveling I do
1600,1605,n't know what to think about it it 's the best why is this not been a thing already you
1605,1610,need internet when you travel more than ever I told myself in the past for in other trips
1610,1615,where I 'm like I 'll just connect to Wii I 'll find free Wi - Fi and then it just
1615,1620,becomes like such a huge hazle that 's never worth it so thank you s for being an
1620,1625,amazing product that I love to sponsor and I 'm also extra happy to be sponsored because I can hook
