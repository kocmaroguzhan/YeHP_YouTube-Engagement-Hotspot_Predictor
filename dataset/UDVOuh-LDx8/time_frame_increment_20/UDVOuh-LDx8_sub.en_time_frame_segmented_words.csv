1420,1440,hello oh
1440,1460,uh wanted to update you guys a little bit I talked about this before but I thing that I 've really struggled with
1460,1480,for the past year is the decision on what we should do uh with staying in Japan or uh moving back to Europe I think especially now that we have bej I kind of have to think about what 's better for uh everyone and uh in many ways uh Japan makes no sense because we 're so far away
1480,1500,from family we are far away from friends that we miss back home and uh it 's just made it very difficult because we we love living in Japan so much I we did n't know what it was going to be like before coming here just trying to come up with a decision that 's been so difficult but we finally decided and we decided that we 're staying do n't know how long but for the future
1500,1520,and I 'm just so happy that we finally made this Choice it feels uh so liberating I do n't know how to explain the fact that like it 's just been in my head for so long that I 'm I 'm just so excited and it just feels right as well this is where we love to be uh I think it will be great for be for the time being as well everyone jokes that he will have to learn four languages
1520,1540,but I guess that is true now for sure obviously it 's not going to be forever but you ca n't really plan for that long anyway and Japan has just has been so good to us and uh we we do n't feel ready to leave it yet cuz we really really love it here and I think it shows in the Vlogs too it 's just endless of things to explore here and we love every day day to day even
1540,1560,when we do n't do stuff so also big thanks to everyone for supporting the Vlogs I 'm about to cough looks like I 'm about to cry but I just my throat hurts I should go with it I 'm crying so thank you guys for watching and uh yeah just want to let you guys know we 've been traveling a lot in this Vlog and the one
1560,1580,thing that I always use when I travel is s s has made my life while traveling 10 times better while you guys and me and myself in the past would wait in line going through the hassle of renting a Wi - Fi box having to carry an extra thing when you 're traveling worrying if it 's charged or not going through swapping out Sims worrying about losing your original
1580,1600,Sim all this stuff should not be a thing and thanks to S it 's no more s is an eim that works in over 180 countries and the best part is you can sign up before you even travel pick how much data you want to use and then do n't have to worry about it as soon as you land it connects and you 're done so while people are waiting in line to do all this extra stuff that you do n't want to do when you 're tired after traveling I do
1600,1620,n't know what to think about it it 's the best why is this not been a thing already you need internet when you travel more than ever I told myself in the past for in other trips where I 'm like I 'll just connect to Wii I 'll find free Wi - Fi and then it just becomes like such a huge hazle that 's never worth it so thank you s for being an
