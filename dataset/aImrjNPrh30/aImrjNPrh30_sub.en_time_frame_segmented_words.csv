15,20,Have you ever been nervous or felt fear when you ’ve had to speak in public ?
20,25,"Maybe you ’ve been on a stage in front of a room full of people , or maybe you had a"
25,30,shared presentation in front of your coworkers . Or maybe you ’ve been in a room full of
30,35,"strangers and they made you stand up and say who you are , where you ’re from , and what you do ."
35,40,"Now , at some point , most people have felt what it feels like to be afraid to speak in"
40,45,"public . For me , I grew up with a tremendous fear of public speaking ."
45,50,and my earliest memory of having a fear to speak happened in the
50,55,second grade . Our teacher was going around the room and calling on students to read .
55,60,"Anybody been there ? I was thinking , “ Please do n’t call on me . Please do n’t call on me . ”"
60,65,And she called someone else . I can relax . But as
65,70,"they would get to the end of what they were reading , that anxiety would start to build again . “"
70,75,Please do n’t call on me . Please do n’t call on me . ” And then it happened . She
75,80,called my name and this wave of anxiety came over my body . And as
80,85,"I started to read , I started fumbling over my words . And the more I tried to get"
85,90,"it together , the worse it got . And I started hearing other kids laughing at me ."
90,95,"And by the time I finished , I was so embarrassed . I remember thinking , “ I never"
95,100,want to do that again . ” And it created this memory early on . “ You ’re not
100,105,a public speaker . This is n’t for you . You just need to stay quiet . ”
105,110,And I kept that memory for years to come . Fast forward to my freshman
110,115,year in college . I had to take a speech class . When I got up to give my
115,120,"speech , that familiar wave of anxiety came over my body again . My"
120,125,"heart started beating out of my chest , my adrenaline was racing , my throat got"
125,130,"dry , my my muscles started to tense up , and when I was looking at my"
130,135,"note card , my hands just started shaking . And when I tried to speak , my voice"
135,140,"started trembling . And I felt this wave of heat come over my body , and I felt like I"
140,145,"was about to pass out . And somehow I made it through the speech , but that"
145,150,"further anchored into my mind , “ You ’re not a speaker . You just need to give this up . ”"
150,155,And I continued to believe that for years . Public speaking is
155,160,"not for me . But over the years , I kept feeling this feeling"
160,165,"inside that I had a message to share , that I needed to"
165,170,"speak , that I could make a bigger impact . So that led me to the first"
170,175,key that helped me overcome my fear of public speaking : the realization that
175,180,everyone has a message to share . Each and every one of
180,185,you has a message inside of you that the world is waiting to hear .
185,190,"And your message matters . But maybe you ’re like me . For years , I did"
190,195,"n’t think I had a message to share . I wondered , “ What could I share that would"
195,200,"help someone else ? ” Well , my friend and mentor , Rory Vaden , says it best ."
200,205,"He says , “ You are perfectly positioned to serve the person you once"
205,210,were . ” Think about that . There ’s stuff you ’ve been through in your life . There
210,215,"’s lessons you ’ve learned , obstacles you ’ve overcome . And there ’s lessons you ’ve learned"
215,220,"along the way that you can take and help other people . Because right now , there ’s someone going"
220,225,"through what you went through in the past , and you can take those lessons you ’ve learned and help"
225,230,"them overcome their challenges . So I started going through my life , and I started"
230,235,"thinking , “ Well , what have I been through , and what lessons have I learned that I could use to help"
235,240,"others ? ” And I started sharing those , and I started helping people . And that 's why I 'm here today ,"
240,245,"sharing this message , because I overcame the fear of public speaking years ago , and I"
245,250,wanted to share what helped me so other people can share their message with the world .
250,255,"So first , I realized I had a message to share . Then I started asking"
255,260,"myself , “ Well , what goes through my head that makes me so nervous before I get up to speak ? ”"
260,265,"And I would think thoughts like , “ They ’re going to judge me . What if they"
265,270,"do n’t like the way I look , or the way I ’m dressed , or what if they do n’t like the sound of my"
270,275,"voice , or what if I mess up and I say the wrong thing ? ” All those thoughts that were"
275,280,"going through my head were about me . Me , me , me . And I realized I needed"
280,285,to shift that . And that led me to the second realization that helped me overcome my fear
285,290,of public speaking : realizing that sharing your message is not about you .
290,295,It ’s about the people you ’re there to serve and what ’s in it for them .
295,300,"And my friend Rory Vaden says it best . He told me , “ Fear"
300,305,disappears when the mission to serve is clear . ” When you have the
305,310,"heart to serve people , you take the focus off of you , and you start focusing on what ’s the"
310,315,benefit that they ’re going to get by hearing my message . And that changed everything for me .
315,320,When I took the focus off of me and I started focusing on what are they going to get out of my
320,325,"message , I realized if one person takes what I have to say and applies it"
325,330,"to their life , it was worth it . So key number one is you have a"
330,335,"message to share . Number two , your message is not about you ."
335,340,It ’s about the people you ’re there to serve . Now the next thing I started to do was I
340,345,"started to study , “ Well , what is fear ? ” And fear is our body ’s natural"
345,350,"response to danger . When our body feels danger , we go into the fight or flight response ."
350,355,And we get ready to run or fight for our lives . So I was
355,360,"studying , “ What are the common causes of fear ? ” And the most common"
360,365,"physiological responses to fear are increased heart rate , increased adrenaline , shallow"
365,370,"breathing , muscle tension , sweating , dry mouth , and butterflies in the stomach ."
370,375,I used to get most of those when I would get up to speak . But I started
375,380,"to ask myself , “ What other times do I feel those feelings ? ” Well , I feel"
380,385,"those feelings when I get excited . So I looked up , “ What are the most common"
385,390,causes or the common physiological responses to excitement ? ” And they are
390,395,"increased heart rate , increased adrenaline , shallow breathing , muscle tension ,"
395,400,"sweating , dry mouth , and butterflies in the stomach . Our bodies go through the"
400,405,exact same physiological response in response to fear or
405,410,"excitement . So the way to tell the difference , if it ’s fear , it ’s associated"
410,415,"with a threat or danger . Or if it ’s excitement , it ’s positive"
415,420,"anticipation . So it all comes down to , “ Am I in danger or am I looking"
420,425,forward to this ? ” And that led me to the third key that helped me overcome my fear :
425,430,I could transform my fear into excitement .
430,435,"When you get up and you start to share your message and you feel those familiar feelings , what I"
435,440,"used to do was say , “ Oh , there ’s that fear again . Remember when you used to"
440,445,speak before ? That did n’t go so well . They ’re going to judge you . This is n’t for you . Why do you
445,450,"think you should do this ? ” And that fear would overtake me . But now what I do , I shifted"
450,455,"that and I created a new story . So when I feel those feelings , I tell"
455,460,"myself , “ You ’re excited . You ’re about to go out there and transform someone ’s life"
460,465,today . ” And now I really do get excited because I know that if I go out and if one
465,470,"person takes what I have to say and they apply it to their life , I can make a positive"
470,475,"impact . So I want you to remember , when you get up and you start to feel those feelings ,"
475,480,you have the ability to transform that fear into excitement .
480,485,"So if you ’re still wondering , “ Why should I share my"
485,490,"message ? What impact do I have to make ? ” Well , I want to take"
490,495,"you back to 2012 . At the time , I was giving the biggest talk that I ’d given at that"
495,500,point . There was an auditorium full of 200 people . And I was ready .
500,505,I knew my message . My mission to serve was clear . I transformed my fear into
505,510,"excitement and I went out there and I delivered . And at the end of the talk , a"
510,515,"man came up to me . He said , “ Dr. Justin , I want to thank you for sharing that message . ”"
515,520,"He said , “ I recently underwent quadruple bypass surgery . ”"
520,525,"He said , “ When I was laying in the hospital bed , my family brought in my little"
525,530,"grandson and they put my grandson on my lap . ” And he said , “ I looked at my grandson and I made a"
530,535,promise right then and there that I ’m going to get my health back because I ’m going to be
535,540,"around to watch my grandson grow up . ” And he said , “ What you just shared with me gave me"
540,545,exactly what I needed to get my health back . ” And not only did he go on to get his
545,550,"health back , at 65 years old , he completed the Ironman , which is a"
550,555,"grueling race , which is a 2.4 - mile swim , a 112 - mile bike"
555,560,"ride , and a complete marathon of 26.2 miles . Not only"
560,565,"has he done one Ironman , he ’s gone on to do multiple Ironman races . And the"
565,570,reason I ’m telling you this is because I never would have been able to make a difference in his
570,575,"life if I would n’t have overcome my fear of public speaking , If I had n’t realized I had a"
575,580,"message to share . And if I did n’t get out and start sharing that message , I never would have been"
580,585,able to help him . But just like that man needed to hear my message in that
585,590,"moment , there is someone that ’s desperately waiting to hear your message ."
590,595,There 's a message inside of you that the world needs to hear . So I want you to
595,600,"ask yourself , “ What impact can I make ? If I overcome my fear of"
600,605,"public speaking and I start sharing my message with the world , what lives can I touch ?"
605,610,What legacy can I leave ? What positive impact can I make in
610,615,the world ? ” I want to leave you with one of my favorite quotes from B.J. Palmer .
615,620,"He says , “ You never know how far - reaching something you may think , say , or do"
620,625,today will affect the lives of millions tomorrow . ” If you
625,630,would have told me years ago that one day I was going to be standing on the TEDx stage in
630,635,"its iconic red circle sharing my message with the world , I would"
635,640,"have said , “ There ’s no way . ” But I ’m here , I did it . And if I can"
640,645,"overcome my fear of public speaking , so can you . So my hope is that you"
645,650,"’ll find your message , you ’ll transform your fear into excitement , and you 'll go out"
650,655,"and you 'll start sharing your message with the world , and you ’ll make a positive impact ."
655,660,I ’m Dr. Justin Moseley . Thank you .
