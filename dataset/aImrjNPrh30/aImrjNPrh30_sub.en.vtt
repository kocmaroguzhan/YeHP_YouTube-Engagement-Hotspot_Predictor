00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:19.265
Have you ever been nervous or felt fear
when you’ve had to speak in public?

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.394
Maybe you’ve been on a stage
in front of a room full of people,

00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:27.023
or maybe you had a shared presentation
in front of your coworkers.

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:31.611
Or maybe you’ve been in a room full
of strangers and they made you stand up

00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:34.655
and say who you are,
where you’re from, and what you do.

00:00:35.198 --> 00:00:38.076
Now, at some point, most people
have felt what it feels like

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:40.161
to be afraid to speak in public.

00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:44.499
For me, I grew up with a tremendous fear
of public speaking.

00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:48.795
and my earliest memory
of having a fear to speak

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:50.588
happened in the second grade.

00:00:51.506 --> 00:00:54.842
Our teacher was going around the room
and calling on students to read.

00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:55.885
Anybody been there?

00:00:56.094 --> 00:00:59.972
I was thinking, “Please don’t call on me.
Please don’t call on me.”

00:01:00.348 --> 00:01:01.724
And she called someone else.

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:03.518
(Sigh) I can relax.

00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:07.438
But as they would get to the end
of what they were reading,

00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:09.440
that anxiety would start to build again.

00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:12.443
“Please don’t call on me.
Please don’t call on me.”

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:13.903
And then it happened.

00:01:14.487 --> 00:01:15.696
She called my name

00:01:16.864 --> 00:01:19.283
and this wave of anxiety
came over my body.

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:22.954
And as I started to read,
I started fumbling over my words.

00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:26.582
And the more I tried to get it together,
the worse it got.

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:29.710
And I started hearing
other kids laughing at me.

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:32.922
And by the time I finished,
I was so embarrassed.

00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:35.925
I remember thinking,
“I never want to do that again.”

00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:39.011
And it created this memory early on.

00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:40.888
“You’re not a public speaker.

00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:43.766
This isn’t for you.
You just need to stay quiet.”

00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:47.562
And I kept that memory for years to come.

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:50.648
Fast forward
to my freshman year in college.

00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:52.859
I had to take a speech class.

00:01:53.526 --> 00:01:55.444
When I got up to give my speech,

00:01:55.528 --> 00:01:58.614
that familiar wave of anxiety
came over my body again.

00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:01.826
My heart started beating out of my chest,

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:05.204
my adrenaline was racing,
my throat got dry,

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:08.040
my my muscles started to tense up,

00:02:08.374 --> 00:02:11.878
and when I was looking at my note card,
my hands just started shaking.

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:15.631
And when I tried to speak,
my voice started trembling.

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.010
And I felt this wave of heat
come over my body,

00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:21.053
and I felt like I was about to pass out.

00:02:22.054 --> 00:02:24.223
And somehow I made it through the speech,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.726
but that further anchored into my mind,

00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:29.854
“You’re not a speaker.
You just need to give this up.”

00:02:31.314 --> 00:02:35.526
And I continued to believe that for years.
Public speaking is not for me.

00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:40.156
But over the years,
I kept feeling this feeling inside

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.201
that I had a message to share,

00:02:43.743 --> 00:02:45.119
that I needed to speak,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.705
that I could make a bigger impact.

00:02:48.414 --> 00:02:51.542
So that led me to the first key
that helped me overcome

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:52.919
my fear of public speaking:

00:02:53.252 --> 00:02:57.340
the realization that everyone
has a message to share.

00:02:58.424 --> 00:03:01.802
Each and every one of you
has a message inside of you

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.930
that the world is waiting to hear.

00:03:04.847 --> 00:03:06.515
And your message matters.

00:03:07.808 --> 00:03:09.060
But maybe you’re like me.

00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:11.562
For years, I didn’t think
I had a message to share.

00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:15.900
I wondered, “What could I share
that would help someone else?”

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:19.904
Well, my friend and mentor,
Rory Vaden, says it best.

00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:25.117
He says, “You are perfectly positioned
to serve the person you once were.”

00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:27.328
Think about that.

00:03:27.328 --> 00:03:29.538
There’s stuff you’ve
been through in your life.

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:32.917
There’s lessons you’ve learned,
obstacles you’ve overcome.

00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:35.503
And there’s lessons
you’ve learned along the way

00:03:35.628 --> 00:03:37.838
that you can take and help other people.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.383
Because right now,
there’s someone going through

00:03:40.383 --> 00:03:42.218
 what you went through in the past,

00:03:42.218 --> 00:03:44.345
and you can take
those lessons you’ve learned

00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:46.472
and help them overcome their challenges.

00:03:47.473 --> 00:03:50.518
So I started going through my life,
and I started thinking,

00:03:50.518 --> 00:03:52.186
“Well, what have I been through,

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:55.356
and what lessons have I learned
that I could use to help others?”

00:03:55.523 --> 00:03:58.234
And I started sharing those,
and I started helping people.

00:03:58.317 --> 00:04:00.945
And that's why I'm here today,
sharing this message,

00:04:01.195 --> 00:04:04.240
because I overcame the fear
of public speaking years ago,

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.284
and I wanted to share what helped me

00:04:06.284 --> 00:04:08.869
so other people can share
their message with the world.

00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:12.999
So first, I realized I had
a message to share.

00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:16.919
Then I started asking myself,
“Well, what goes through my head

00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:19.797
that makes me so nervous
before I get up to speak?”

00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:22.008
And I would think thoughts like,

00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:24.093
“They’re going to judge me.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.805
What if they don’t like the way I look,
or the way I’m dressed,

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:30.099
or what if they don’t like
the sound of my voice,

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:32.518
or what if I mess up
and I say the wrong thing?”

00:04:33.602 --> 00:04:36.689
All those thoughts that were
going through my head were about me.

00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:38.149
 Me, me, me.

00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:40.693
And I realized I needed to shift that.

00:04:41.277 --> 00:04:43.404
And that led me to the second realization

00:04:43.404 --> 00:04:45.823
that helped me overcome
my fear of public speaking:

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.827
realizing that sharing your message
is not about you.

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:52.663
It’s about the people
you’re there to serve

00:04:52.913 --> 00:04:54.665
and what’s in it for them.

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:58.127
And my friend Rory Vaden says it best.

00:04:58.586 --> 00:05:03.090
He told me, “Fear disappears
when the mission to serve is clear.”

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.720
When you have the heart to serve people,
you take the focus off of you,

00:05:07.887 --> 00:05:11.223
 and you start focusing on what’s
the benefit that they’re going to get

00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:12.683
by hearing my message.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.852
And that changed everything for me.

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:16.979
When I took the focus off of me

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.358
and I started focusing on what
are they going to get out of my message,

00:05:20.524 --> 00:05:23.944
I realized if one person
takes what I have to say

00:05:24.153 --> 00:05:25.696
and applies it to their life,

00:05:25.863 --> 00:05:27.031
it was worth it.

00:05:28.157 --> 00:05:30.993
So key number one is
you have a message to share.

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:34.914
Number two, your message is not about you.

00:05:34.997 --> 00:05:37.124
It’s about the people
you’re there to serve.

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:40.586
Now the next thing I started to do
was I started to study,

00:05:40.586 --> 00:05:42.046
“Well, what is fear?”

00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:45.674
And fear is our body’s
natural response to danger.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.887
When our body feels danger,
we go into the fight or flight response.

00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:53.682
And we get ready to run
or fight for our lives.

00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:58.020
So I was studying,
“What are the common causes of fear?”

00:05:58.604 --> 00:06:01.315
And the most common
physiological responses to fear

00:06:01.482 --> 00:06:04.318
are increased heart rate,
increased adrenaline,

00:06:04.318 --> 00:06:07.238
shallow breathing,
muscle tension, sweating,

00:06:07.238 --> 00:06:09.949
dry mouth, and butterflies in the stomach.

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.411
I used to get most of those
when I would get up to speak.

00:06:13.953 --> 00:06:15.871
But I started to ask myself,

00:06:15.955 --> 00:06:18.249
“What other times
do I feel those feelings?”

00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:21.627
Well, I feel those feelings
when I get excited.

00:06:22.253 --> 00:06:25.214
So I looked up,
“What are the most common causes

00:06:25.214 --> 00:06:28.801
or the common physiological
responses to excitement?”

00:06:29.176 --> 00:06:32.721
And they are increased heart rate,
increased adrenaline,

00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:36.100
shallow breathing, muscle tension,
sweating, dry mouth,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.810
and butterflies in the stomach.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.939
Our bodies go through
the exact same physiological response

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:45.317
in response to fear or excitement.

00:06:46.026 --> 00:06:47.653
So the way to tell the difference,

00:06:47.653 --> 00:06:51.323
if it’s fear, it’s associated
with a threat or danger.

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.786
Or if it’s excitement,
it’s positive anticipation.

00:06:56.245 --> 00:07:01.000
So it all comes down to, “Am I in danger
or am I looking forward to this?”

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:04.712
And that led me to the third key
that helped me overcome my fear:

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:08.924
I could transform my fear into excitement.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.470
When you get up
and you start to share your message

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.388
and you feel those familiar feelings,

00:07:14.513 --> 00:07:17.808
what I used to do was say,
“Oh, there’s that fear again.

00:07:18.184 --> 00:07:22.062
Remember when you used to speak before?
That didn’t go so well.

00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:24.482
They’re going to judge you.
This isn’t for you.

00:07:24.482 --> 00:07:26.275
Why do you think you should do this?”

00:07:26.275 --> 00:07:27.902
And that fear would overtake me.

00:07:28.277 --> 00:07:31.947
But now what I do, I shifted that
and I created a new story.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.451
So when I feel those feelings,
I tell myself,

00:07:35.576 --> 00:07:36.744
“You’re excited.

00:07:37.077 --> 00:07:40.164
You’re about to go out there
and transform someone’s life today.”

00:07:40.664 --> 00:07:42.500
And now I really do get excited

00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:44.293
because I know that if I go out

00:07:44.293 --> 00:07:48.506
and if one person takes what I have to say
and they apply it to their life,

00:07:48.506 --> 00:07:50.299
I can make a positive impact.

00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:54.887
So I want you to remember, when you get up
and you start to feel those feelings,

00:07:55.054 --> 00:07:59.141
you have the ability to transform
that fear into excitement.

00:08:00.643 --> 00:08:02.311
So if you’re still wondering,

00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:05.397
“Why should I share my message?

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.983
What impact do I have to make?”

00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:10.986
Well, I want to take you back to 2012.

00:08:11.654 --> 00:08:15.074
At the time, I was giving the biggest talk
that I’d given at that point.

00:08:15.324 --> 00:08:17.660
There was an auditorium
full of 200 people.

00:08:18.494 --> 00:08:19.828
And I was ready.

00:08:20.037 --> 00:08:23.165
I knew my message.
My mission to serve was clear.

00:08:23.249 --> 00:08:27.753
I transformed my fear into excitement
and I went out there and I delivered.

00:08:28.254 --> 00:08:30.756
And at the end of the talk,
a man came up to me.

00:08:31.298 --> 00:08:34.593
He said, “Dr. Justin, I want to thank you
for sharing that message.”

00:08:35.594 --> 00:08:39.723
He said, “I recently underwent
quadruple bypass surgery.”

00:08:40.307 --> 00:08:42.560
He said, “When I was laying
in the hospital bed,

00:08:42.768 --> 00:08:47.022
my family brought in my little grandson
and they put my grandson on my lap.”

00:08:47.273 --> 00:08:51.360
And he said, “I looked at my grandson
and I made a promise right then and there

00:08:51.652 --> 00:08:53.612
that I’m going to get my health back

00:08:53.821 --> 00:08:56.740
because I’m going to be around
to watch my grandson grow up.”

00:08:57.491 --> 00:09:00.911
And he said, “What you just shared with me
gave me exactly what I needed

00:09:00.911 --> 00:09:02.329
to get my health back.”

00:09:03.247 --> 00:09:05.541
And not only did he go on
to get his health back,

00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:08.252
 at 65 years old,
he completed the Ironman,

00:09:08.836 --> 00:09:10.588
which is a grueling race,

00:09:10.713 --> 00:09:12.756
 which is a 2.4-mile swim,

00:09:12.881 --> 00:09:15.342
a 112-mile bike ride,

00:09:15.593 --> 00:09:18.679
and a complete marathon of 26.2 miles.

00:09:19.513 --> 00:09:23.559
Not only has he done one Ironman,
he’s gone on to do multiple Ironman races.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.395
And the reason I’m telling you this

00:09:26.687 --> 00:09:30.107
is because I never would have been able
to make a difference in his life

00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:32.735
if I wouldn’t have overcome
my fear of public speaking,

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.821
If I hadn’t realized I had
a message to share.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.616
And if I didn’t get out
and start sharing that message,

00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:40.659
I never would have been able to help him.

00:09:41.869 --> 00:09:45.414
But just like that man needed
to hear my message in that moment,

00:09:45.748 --> 00:09:48.959
there is someone that’s desperately
waiting to hear your message.

00:09:49.668 --> 00:09:53.172
There's a message inside of you
that the world needs to hear.

00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:55.716
So I want you to ask yourself,

00:09:56.216 --> 00:09:57.926
“What impact can I make?

00:09:58.594 --> 00:10:00.971
If I overcome my fear of public speaking

00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:03.307
and I start sharing
my message with the world,

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.850
what lives can I touch?

00:10:05.351 --> 00:10:07.144
What legacy can I leave?

00:10:07.394 --> 00:10:10.481
What positive impact
can I make in the world?”

00:10:11.398 --> 00:10:14.610
I want to leave you with one
of my favorite quotes from B.J. Palmer.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.112
He says, “You never know how far-reaching

00:10:17.404 --> 00:10:20.199
something you may think, say, or do today

00:10:20.324 --> 00:10:22.826
will affect the lives
of millions tomorrow.”

00:10:24.578 --> 00:10:26.455
If you would have told me years ago

00:10:26.455 --> 00:10:29.583
that one day I was going to be
standing on the TEDx stage

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.794
 in its iconic red circle

00:10:32.795 --> 00:10:34.463
sharing my message with the world,

00:10:34.463 --> 00:10:36.382
I would have said, “There’s no way.”

00:10:36.757 --> 00:10:38.384
But I’m here, I did it.

00:10:39.218 --> 00:10:41.720
And if I can overcome
my fear of public speaking,

00:10:41.887 --> 00:10:43.222
so can you.

00:10:43.472 --> 00:10:46.266
So my hope is
that you’ll find your message,

00:10:46.517 --> 00:10:49.103
you’ll transform
your fear into excitement,

00:10:49.186 --> 00:10:52.523
and you'll go out and you'll start sharing
your message with the world,

00:10:52.564 --> 00:10:54.400
and you’ll make a positive impact.

00:10:55.442 --> 00:10:57.903
I’m Dr. Justin Moseley. Thank you.

00:10:58.153 --> 00:11:00.114
(Applause and cheers)
