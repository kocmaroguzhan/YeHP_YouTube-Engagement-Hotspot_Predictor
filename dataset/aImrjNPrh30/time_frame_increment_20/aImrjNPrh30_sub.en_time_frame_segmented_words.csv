0,20,Have you ever been nervous or felt fear when you ’ve had to speak in public ?
20,40,"Maybe you ’ve been on a stage in front of a room full of people , or maybe you had a shared presentation in front of your coworkers . Or maybe you ’ve been in a room full of strangers and they made you stand up and say who you are , where you ’re from , and what you do . Now , at some point , most people have felt what it feels like to be afraid to speak in"
40,60,"public . For me , I grew up with a tremendous fear of public speaking . and my earliest memory of having a fear to speak happened in the second grade . Our teacher was going around the room and calling on students to read . Anybody been there ? I was thinking , “ Please do n’t call on me . Please do n’t call on me . ”"
60,80,"And she called someone else . I can relax . But as they would get to the end of what they were reading , that anxiety would start to build again . “ Please do n’t call on me . Please do n’t call on me . ” And then it happened . She called my name and this wave of anxiety came over my body . And as"
80,100,"I started to read , I started fumbling over my words . And the more I tried to get it together , the worse it got . And I started hearing other kids laughing at me . And by the time I finished , I was so embarrassed . I remember thinking , “ I never want to do that again . ” And it created this memory early on . “ You ’re not"
100,120,"a public speaker . This is n’t for you . You just need to stay quiet . ” And I kept that memory for years to come . Fast forward to my freshman year in college . I had to take a speech class . When I got up to give my speech , that familiar wave of anxiety came over my body again . My"
120,140,"heart started beating out of my chest , my adrenaline was racing , my throat got dry , my my muscles started to tense up , and when I was looking at my note card , my hands just started shaking . And when I tried to speak , my voice started trembling . And I felt this wave of heat come over my body , and I felt like I"
140,160,"was about to pass out . And somehow I made it through the speech , but that further anchored into my mind , “ You ’re not a speaker . You just need to give this up . ” And I continued to believe that for years . Public speaking is not for me . But over the years , I kept feeling this feeling"
160,180,"inside that I had a message to share , that I needed to speak , that I could make a bigger impact . So that led me to the first key that helped me overcome my fear of public speaking : the realization that everyone has a message to share . Each and every one of"
180,200,"you has a message inside of you that the world is waiting to hear . And your message matters . But maybe you ’re like me . For years , I did n’t think I had a message to share . I wondered , “ What could I share that would help someone else ? ” Well , my friend and mentor , Rory Vaden , says it best ."
200,220,"He says , “ You are perfectly positioned to serve the person you once were . ” Think about that . There ’s stuff you ’ve been through in your life . There ’s lessons you ’ve learned , obstacles you ’ve overcome . And there ’s lessons you ’ve learned along the way that you can take and help other people . Because right now , there ’s someone going"
220,240,"through what you went through in the past , and you can take those lessons you ’ve learned and help them overcome their challenges . So I started going through my life , and I started thinking , “ Well , what have I been through , and what lessons have I learned that I could use to help others ? ” And I started sharing those , and I started helping people . And that 's why I 'm here today ,"
240,260,"sharing this message , because I overcame the fear of public speaking years ago , and I wanted to share what helped me so other people can share their message with the world . So first , I realized I had a message to share . Then I started asking myself , “ Well , what goes through my head that makes me so nervous before I get up to speak ? ”"
260,280,"And I would think thoughts like , “ They ’re going to judge me . What if they do n’t like the way I look , or the way I ’m dressed , or what if they do n’t like the sound of my voice , or what if I mess up and I say the wrong thing ? ” All those thoughts that were going through my head were about me . Me , me , me . And I realized I needed"
280,300,"to shift that . And that led me to the second realization that helped me overcome my fear of public speaking : realizing that sharing your message is not about you . It ’s about the people you ’re there to serve and what ’s in it for them . And my friend Rory Vaden says it best . He told me , “ Fear"
300,320,"disappears when the mission to serve is clear . ” When you have the heart to serve people , you take the focus off of you , and you start focusing on what ’s the benefit that they ’re going to get by hearing my message . And that changed everything for me . When I took the focus off of me and I started focusing on what are they going to get out of my"
320,340,"message , I realized if one person takes what I have to say and applies it to their life , it was worth it . So key number one is you have a message to share . Number two , your message is not about you . It ’s about the people you ’re there to serve . Now the next thing I started to do was I"
340,360,"started to study , “ Well , what is fear ? ” And fear is our body ’s natural response to danger . When our body feels danger , we go into the fight or flight response . And we get ready to run or fight for our lives . So I was studying , “ What are the common causes of fear ? ” And the most common"
360,380,"physiological responses to fear are increased heart rate , increased adrenaline , shallow breathing , muscle tension , sweating , dry mouth , and butterflies in the stomach . I used to get most of those when I would get up to speak . But I started to ask myself , “ What other times do I feel those feelings ? ” Well , I feel"
380,400,"those feelings when I get excited . So I looked up , “ What are the most common causes or the common physiological responses to excitement ? ” And they are increased heart rate , increased adrenaline , shallow breathing , muscle tension , sweating , dry mouth , and butterflies in the stomach . Our bodies go through the"
400,420,"exact same physiological response in response to fear or excitement . So the way to tell the difference , if it ’s fear , it ’s associated with a threat or danger . Or if it ’s excitement , it ’s positive anticipation . So it all comes down to , “ Am I in danger or am I looking"
420,440,"forward to this ? ” And that led me to the third key that helped me overcome my fear : I could transform my fear into excitement . When you get up and you start to share your message and you feel those familiar feelings , what I used to do was say , “ Oh , there ’s that fear again . Remember when you used to"
440,460,"speak before ? That did n’t go so well . They ’re going to judge you . This is n’t for you . Why do you think you should do this ? ” And that fear would overtake me . But now what I do , I shifted that and I created a new story . So when I feel those feelings , I tell myself , “ You ’re excited . You ’re about to go out there and transform someone ’s life"
460,480,"today . ” And now I really do get excited because I know that if I go out and if one person takes what I have to say and they apply it to their life , I can make a positive impact . So I want you to remember , when you get up and you start to feel those feelings , you have the ability to transform that fear into excitement ."
480,500,"So if you ’re still wondering , “ Why should I share my message ? What impact do I have to make ? ” Well , I want to take you back to 2012 . At the time , I was giving the biggest talk that I ’d given at that point . There was an auditorium full of 200 people . And I was ready ."
500,520,"I knew my message . My mission to serve was clear . I transformed my fear into excitement and I went out there and I delivered . And at the end of the talk , a man came up to me . He said , “ Dr. Justin , I want to thank you for sharing that message . ” He said , “ I recently underwent quadruple bypass surgery . ”"
520,540,"He said , “ When I was laying in the hospital bed , my family brought in my little grandson and they put my grandson on my lap . ” And he said , “ I looked at my grandson and I made a promise right then and there that I ’m going to get my health back because I ’m going to be around to watch my grandson grow up . ” And he said , “ What you just shared with me gave me"
540,560,"exactly what I needed to get my health back . ” And not only did he go on to get his health back , at 65 years old , he completed the Ironman , which is a grueling race , which is a 2.4 - mile swim , a 112 - mile bike ride , and a complete marathon of 26.2 miles . Not only"
560,580,"has he done one Ironman , he ’s gone on to do multiple Ironman races . And the reason I ’m telling you this is because I never would have been able to make a difference in his life if I would n’t have overcome my fear of public speaking , If I had n’t realized I had a message to share . And if I did n’t get out and start sharing that message , I never would have been"
580,600,"able to help him . But just like that man needed to hear my message in that moment , there is someone that ’s desperately waiting to hear your message . There 's a message inside of you that the world needs to hear . So I want you to ask yourself , “ What impact can I make ? If I overcome my fear of"
600,620,"public speaking and I start sharing my message with the world , what lives can I touch ? What legacy can I leave ? What positive impact can I make in the world ? ” I want to leave you with one of my favorite quotes from B.J. Palmer . He says , “ You never know how far - reaching something you may think , say , or do"
620,640,"today will affect the lives of millions tomorrow . ” If you would have told me years ago that one day I was going to be standing on the TEDx stage in its iconic red circle sharing my message with the world , I would have said , “ There ’s no way . ” But I ’m here , I did it . And if I can"
640,660,"overcome my fear of public speaking , so can you . So my hope is that you ’ll find your message , you ’ll transform your fear into excitement , and you 'll go out and you 'll start sharing your message with the world , and you ’ll make a positive impact . I ’m Dr. Justin Moseley . Thank you ."
