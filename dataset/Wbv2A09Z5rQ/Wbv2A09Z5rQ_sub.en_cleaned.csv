135.92,137.27,horses all over the
137.28,140.509,walls is basashi famous
140.519,144.35,here made most popular in this region of
144.36,146.79,Japan basashi or raw HSE meat is
146.8,148.949,considered a delicacy the history of the
148.959,150.99,dish dates back to ancient times when
151.0,153.229,people ate it to survive during famines
153.239,154.67,the tradition continued over the
154.68,156.03,centuries because the climate of
156.04,157.949,Kumamoto is very ideal for horse
157.959,160.11,breeding today basashi is a gourmet
160.12,161.71,experience and I'm anxious to give it a
161.72,163.79,try in the most famous restaurant right
163.8,166.39,here we have a tray of raw horse meat
166.4,168.19,I'm a little intimidated to eat it it's
168.2,170.149,crazy to me that they eat horse in Japan
170.159,171.55,cuz the only other time I've had it is
171.56,174.589,in usbekistan and Kazakhstan T's like
174.599,177.589,salami it's a big piece of horse dipping
177.599,183.03,it in the sauce raw horse meat in
183.04,185.39,Japan yeah it kind of tastes like tuna
185.4,187.35,but a little chewier it doesn't have
187.36,189.03,much flavor I don't know how I feel
189.04,191.229,about it it's Chewy though I ate it it's
191.239,192.309,not like it's the worst thing I've ever
192.319,194.18,had it just doesn't have much of a
197.36,199.75,taste really tasty I don't feel it's
199.76,201.71,like horse it's like fish there's also a
201.72,204.75,plate of horse liver this one looks
204.76,208.589,really gross I don't know if I can eat
208.599,213.63,this yeah can't do
213.64,216.83,it yeah look pretty bad to take down and
216.84,218.39,I don't know that I'm going to do it
218.4,220.509,lightly I'm not a fan of liver I
220.519,221.39,actually think liver is one of the
221.4,222.99,grossest things that you can eat but I
223.0,224.3,never thought I would eat
226.519,228.869,this oh my God it's terrible that's one
228.879,230.429,of the worst I've ever
230.439,233.27,had oh my God it tastes like I just ate
233.28,234.429,like a
234.439,236.27,cockroach I think I going have to add
236.28,237.869,that to my Bizarre Foods list of one of
237.879,239.149,the craziest things I've eaten horse
240.48,242.83,oh good experience but let's just say I
242.84,245.149,won't be eating that again anytime soon
245.159,247.03,if you think horse liver is Extreme then
247.04,248.789,prepare yourself for the next dish which
248.799,251.11,is located in the town of Miyazaki as we
251.12,253.11,drove across the beautiful kushu island
253.12,255.27,we indulge in a geothermal sand bath
255.28,256.629,this is so

481.84,483.869,tiny brains has a creamy texture and a
483.879,485.71,pungent flavor that some people enjoy
485.72,487.629,Shido is consumed either raw like

530.56,532.949,up our tolerance we are ready for
532.959,535.509,Fugu the infamous puffer fish known for
535.519,537.79,its deadly toxin that kills 20 people a
537.8,540.829,year the FDA has ENT ify the puffer fish
540.839,543.19,species that killed one and sickened
543.2,545.71,eight others we are flying to Tokyo
545.72,547.43,because we've been invited by a Top fuku
547.44,549.71,Chef Mr Yamada to learn how this dish is
549.72,552.67,prepared from start to finish okay he's
552.68,554.31,been running a popular restaurant called
554.32,556.829,koshii for five generations so it's safe
556.839,559.23,to say this guy really knows his Fugu as
559.24,560.87,soon as we arrive in Tokyo we take a
560.88,562.91,taxi to meet Mr Yamada inside of the
562.92,565.31,fresh fish market we've just entered the
565.32,567.389,fugu Market here I don't know where we
567.399,569.069,are but I do know that I have really bad
569.079,570.87,food poisoning somehow I got it in Japan
570.88,572.67,and I was up all night on the toilet so
572.68,574.63,the smell of fish right now is making me
576.64,580.35,nauseous do people die eating this yeah
580.36,581.829,how many
581.839,584.509,people if they eat and they feel like
584.519,586.23,something and they die only a little
586.24,587.99,poison little poison how do you remove
589.44,592.11,poison they cut the stomach and they
592.12,594.63,take take out the poison the history of
594.64,596.509,fugu dates back hundreds of years after
596.519,598.15,it was discovered near a small Seaside
598.16,600.19,town called Shimon AI local fishermen
600.2,601.47,caught a bunch of puffer fish and
601.48,603.03,brought them to the shore but then
603.04,604.87,people started dying after eating it so
604.88,606.67,the Japanese government banned it in the
606.68,608.949,late 1800s the band was lifted but with
608.959,611.15,strict regulations to ensure safety the
611.16,612.509,first Fugu restaurant was opened in
612.519,614.79,shimonoseki in 1888 which marked the
614.8,616.63,beginning of the regulated Fugu industry
616.64,619.389,in Japan we're outside the fish market
619.399,621.59,here the chef has purchased all these
621.6,623.35,Fugu there's probably a dozen of them in
623.36,625.069,these tanks and now they're transporting
625.079,627.15,it to the restaurant if they bite you
627.16,629.35,lose your finger they have a strong
629.36,631.75,power why is he not scared he gets used
631.76,633.99,to it with a car full of fresh Fugu we
634.0,635.87,head back to the restaurant so Mr Yamada
635.88,637.949,can prepare it safely so right now
637.959,639.75,they're taking all the fugu from the car
639.76,642.35,and delivering it to the chef himself
642.36,643.389,this is going to be really interesting
643.399,645.509,see how he prepares
645.519,647.91,it the process begins with carefully
647.92,649.629,removing the skin and then cutting out
649.639,651.67,the liver ovaries and intestines which
651.68,653.949,contain the lethal poison did I mention
653.959,655.71,the fish is prepared alive for further
655.72,658.069,safety reasons if any mistakes are made
658.079,659.79,then whoever eats it will die die within
659.8,663.509,minutes W poison I have so much trust in
663.519,665.35,Mr Yamada because his attention to
665.36,667.55,detail is mind-blowing how many years
667.56,668.99,are you a Fugu
669.0,672.11,Chef 45 years is it true that people
672.12,675.15,actually die from eating Fugu yes yes
675.16,677.55,yes true so it will never happen in the
677.56,679.269,restaurant like restaurant but the
679.279,682.11,fishermen if they fish Fugu and they eat
682.12,684.11,and they die have you ever tried the
684.12,686.43,poison like even like a tiny
686.44,689.35,bit once he tried a little bit and he
689.36,691.31,called is like B fast watching his
691.32,693.59,precise Cuts I feel a mix of Fascination
693.6,695.509,and unease the idea of eating something
695.519,697.389,that could kill me is terrifying I've
697.399,698.949,done my research and seen how gruesome
698.959,700.67,the desk can be and it's hard to shake
700.68,703.91,off that fear
