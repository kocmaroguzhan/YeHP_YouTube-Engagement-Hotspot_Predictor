75,80,its unique appearance sticky slimy and stringy this is
80,85,spice and this is show you did you eat this when you were a kid every morning even adult

100,105,snot let 's just say that Nat is n't my favorite dish I can already tell that the taste is going to linger on my
105,110,tongue for the rest of the day like durian the smelly fruit from
110,115,Malaysia it 's really creamy and gooey to continue our bizarre food tour of Japan Kos and I
115,120,are flying to the southern island of kushu and what we 're about to try next might make you
120,125,squeamish we made it to rainy Kumamoto in kushu Island to try horse meat or
125,130,basashi because it 's famous here so we found a restaurant serving raw horse meat are you ready
130,135,yes I 'm ready let 's go yeah excited the restaurant 's really cool and the owner is really
135,140,friendly and there 's horses all over the walls is basashi
140,145,famous here made most popular in this region of Japan
145,150,basashi or raw HSE meat is considered a delicacy the history of the dish dates back to
150,155,ancient times when people ate it to survive during famines the tradition continued over the
155,160,centuries because the climate of Kumamoto is very ideal for horse breeding today basashi is a
160,165,gourmet experience and I 'm anxious to give it a try in the most famous restaurant right here we have a
165,170,tray of raw horse meat I 'm a little intimidated to eat it it 's crazy to me that they eat horse in
170,175,Japan cuz the only other time I 've had it is in usbekistan and Kazakhstan T 's like
175,180,salami it 's a big piece of horse dipping it in the
180,185,sauce raw horse meat in Japan yeah it kind of tastes
185,190,like tuna but a little chewier it does n't have much flavor I do n't know how I feel about it it 's
190,195,Chewy though I ate it it 's not like it 's the worst thing I 've ever had it just does n't have much of a
195,200,taste really tasty I do n't feel it 's like

205,210,really gross I do n't know if I can eat this

215,220,pretty bad to take down and I do n't know that I 'm going to do it lightly I 'm not a fan
220,225,of liver I actually think liver is one of the grossest things that you can eat but I never thought I would eat
225,230,this oh my God it 's terrible that 's one of the worst I
230,235,'ve ever had oh my God it tastes like I just ate like a cockroach
235,240,I think I going have to add that to my Bizarre Foods list of one of the craziest things I 've eaten horse
240,245,oh good experience but let 's just say I wo n't be eating that again anytime
245,250,soon if you think horse liver is Extreme then prepare yourself for the next dish which is located in the
250,255,town of Miyazaki as we drove across the beautiful kushu island we indulge in a geothermal sand

470,475,i i never I never eat you do n't like eating sperm no no
475,480,shako or Cod sperm is a surprising delicacy served in specific restaurants
480,485,across Japan the dish which looks like tiny brains has a creamy texture and a pungent flavor that
485,490,some people enjoy Shido is consumed either raw like Sashimi or lightly cooked but no matter
490,495,how it 's prepared it is not for the
500,505,MH I do n't know I do n't know like just
505,510,gross if bite some juice coming out here goes nothing
510,515,it 's odly

520,525,have as much of a punch as like liver it 's like salty and gooey and slimy yeah the
525,530,aftertaste is gross there 's a lot of jokes I can make right now but I 'll save them for later oh now that we
530,535,'ve built up our tolerance we are ready for Fugu the infamous puffer fish
535,540,known for its deadly toxin that kills 20 people a year the FDA has ENT ify the
540,545,puffer fish species that killed one and sickened eight others we are
545,550,flying to Tokyo because we 've been invited by a Top fuku Chef Mr Yamada to learn how this dish is
550,555,prepared from start to finish okay he 's been running a popular restaurant called koshii for
555,560,five generations so it 's safe to say this guy really knows his Fugu as soon as we
560,565,arrive in Tokyo we take a taxi to meet Mr Yamada inside of the fresh fish market we 've just
565,570,entered the fugu Market here I do n't know where we are but I do know that I have really bad food poisoning
570,575,somehow I got it in Japan and I was up all night on the toilet so the smell of fish right now is making me
575,580,nauseous do people die eating this
580,585,yeah how many people if they eat and they feel like
585,590,something and they die only a little poison little poison how do you remove poison
590,595,they cut the stomach and they take take out the poison the history of fugu
595,600,dates back hundreds of years after it was discovered near a small Seaside town called Shimon AI local
600,605,fishermen caught a bunch of puffer fish and brought them to the shore but then people started dying after eating it so
605,610,the Japanese government banned it in the late 1800s the band was lifted but with strict
610,615,regulations to ensure safety the first Fugu restaurant was opened in shimonoseki in 1888 which marked the
615,620,beginning of the regulated Fugu industry in Japan we 're outside the fish market here the
620,625,chef has purchased all these Fugu there 's probably a dozen of them in these tanks and now they 're
625,630,transporting it to the restaurant if they bite you lose your finger they have a strong power why
630,635,is he not scared he gets used to it with a car full of fresh Fugu we head back to the
635,640,restaurant so Mr Yamada can prepare it safely so right now they 're taking all the fugu from the car
640,645,and delivering it to the chef himself this is going to be really interesting see how he
645,650,prepares it the process begins with carefully removing the skin and then cutting out the
650,655,liver ovaries and intestines which contain the lethal poison did I mention the fish is prepared
655,660,alive for further safety reasons if any mistakes are made then whoever eats it will die die within
660,665,minutes W poison I have so much trust in Mr Yamada because his
665,670,attention to detail is mind - blowing how many years are you a Fugu Chef 45
670,675,years is it true that people actually die from eating Fugu yes
675,680,yes yes true so it will never happen in the restaurant like restaurant but the
680,685,fishermen if they fish Fugu and they eat and they die have you ever tried the poison
685,690,like even like a tiny bit once he tried a little bit and he called is
690,695,like B fast watching his precise Cuts I feel a mix of Fascination and unease the idea of eating
695,700,something that could kill me is terrifying I 've done my research and seen how gruesome the desk can be and it
700,705,'s hard to shake off that fear oo that
705,710,'s a skin yeah oh oh you guys are all one family
710,715,yes yes yes they all family that 's awesome it 's really cool you 're
715,720,the fugu master of Japan yes

805,810,bizarre food over the last few days has been incredible oh yeah even if these dishes seem

815,820,meat and cod sperm each dish pushed my boundaries and tantalize my taste buds oh that was
820,825,good o thank you for watching and I 'll see you guys in the next
