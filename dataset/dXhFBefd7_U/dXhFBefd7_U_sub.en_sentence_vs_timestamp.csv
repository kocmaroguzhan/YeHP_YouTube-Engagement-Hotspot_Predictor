744.994,745.828,I can tell.
745.828,747.288,And this has my ingredients.
747.288,750.5830000000001,Half a slab of bacon diced into cubes.
751.584,752.418,Okay.
752.418,754.503,This looks infected.
754.503,756.0879999999999,And I feel great about that.
756.088,759.0910000000001,"But fun fact, bacon has no germs in it."
759.091,761.4689999999998,"Damn, that's some fatty-ass bacon, yo."
761.469,763.053,That's some thick cut.
763.053,767.0990000000002,"I had another cutting board, and it's got meat on it, but I had meat."
767.099,769.4350000000001,"It's gonna be more meat, so I think that's fine."
769.435,771.2699999999999,Food safety is very important to me.

772.813,773.8979999999999,And this is sort of-
774.732,775.5659999999999,The most important part.
775.566,776.4,No!
776.4,777.234,"Okay, hold on."

819.068,822.655,You will continue chopping till we see you cry.
831.372,832.456,It's so beautiful.
832.456,833.29,Ow.
835.668,835.8248,Oh .

838.838,841.006,"I'm a really good actor, so here's what we're gonna do."
841.006,843.3420000000002,We're gonna manufacture this because you didn't say how.
843.342,845.4270000000001,So I'm gonna act myself into crying.
845.427,846.6369999999998,So here's what we're gonna do.
846.637,847.972,Are you ready?
852.893,854.061,I just like...
855.437,856.272,Sorry.
856.272,857.9820000000001,"I like, I think about like..."
857.982,860.5680000000001,Being here with these onions right now.
860.568,866.6150000000001,"And this is actually my first time having seen onions in a really, really long time."
873.455,875.2069999999999,It's really lovely.
876.292,877.209,Not enough?
890.264,892.6000000000001,It is just so beautiful.
892.6,894.018,And the onions...
897.062,900.1489999999999,Life's funny that way sometimes.
900.149,903.3599999999999,You meet people in the most unexpected places.
903.36,906.28,I'm just happy we have this moment.
909.074,910.576,God.
910.576,912.0360000000001,"Okay, there we go."
912.036,915.8729999999999,Do we still need four onions for this recipe?
917.583,918.918,"Oh, thank you."
920.044,921.128,Ooh.
921.128,922.4625454545454,Step four!
922.4625454545454,922.963,Yes!
922.963,925.5490000000001,Set a dutch oven over medium heat and add the bacon.
925.549,928.5100000000001,And cook until fat is rendered.
928.51,931.2209999999998,This looks like a crime scene in here.
931.221,934.7250000000001,"Step five, drain all but one tablespoon of oil from the pot."
934.725,944.109,"One and a half teaspoons of mustard seed, two and a half tablespoons of dark brown sugar, and a quarter cup of balsamic."
944.109,945.319,Add onions.
945.319,947.2369999999999,This is so many onions.
949.156,950.491,"Okay, perfect."
950.491,951.575,We don't have balsamic.
951.575,953.9109999999998,So what are we going to use?
955.037,957.3730000000002,I think the lemonade.
957.373,959.5410000000002,I want something with sort of citrus in it.
959.541,961.6270000000001,Three tablespoons of water.
961.627,965.9230000000001,"I know it looks like this is the tap water color, but there is vinegar in here."
965.923,966.7570000000001,This is not...
966.757,969.468,Our pipes are fine at 2nd Try.
969.468,970.26,Fun fact.
970.26,975.474,A cube of ice is perfectly every time measured out as one tablespoon of water.
975.474,977.059,Okay.
977.059,977.893,Okay.
977.893,980.4369999999999,"Stir, cover, and cook for as long as you possibly can."
980.437,982.022,But do not let it burn.
982.022,983.8569999999999,"Don't let it burn, chef."
983.857,985.442,And I won't.
989.655,991.323,Run with scissors?
993.867,995.703,I don't have scissors.
997.705,999.164,Run with scissors.

1068.4,1069.8599999999997,Do you have anything in your pocket?
1069.86,1071.195,No.
1072.446,1074.281,"Oh, bye, Scissor."
1074.281,1077.2419999999997,"Oh, there he goes, back to the wild."
1077.242,1078.327,Oh.
1078.327,1079.661,"Good luck, Scissor."
1079.661,1080.3402857142858,Oh shit!
1080.3402857142858,1081.246,My onions!
1083.123,1083.957,Whew.
1085.709,1086.919,Here we go.
1086.919,1087.8643333333332,Here we go.
1087.8643333333332,1088.3369999999998,Okay.
1089.838,1090.547,Onions.
1090.547,1091.256,Onions.
1092.424,1093.759,"Oh, they didn't burn."
1093.759,1094.718,They're beautiful.
1094.718,1096.804,The most beautiful onions there ever was.
1096.804,1099.5150000000003,Add oil to a large cast iron skillet over medium heat.
1099.515,1100.4740000000004,Doesn't say how much.
1100.474,1102.0590000000002,We follow our heart.
1106.772,1110.1920000000002,"If this doesn't have just a medium option, I am going to cry."
1112.152,1113.112,440.
1113.112,1114.696,That is an oven.
1114.696,1115.906,We're talking oven temperatures.
1115.906,1118.2420000000006,I didn't even know you could measure fire like that.
1118.242,1119.66,I thought that was an oven thing.
1119.66,1120.744,So 440.
1120.744,1123.0799999999997,So medium heat would be two.
1124.081,1125.332,That seems low.
1126.542,1127.3759999999997,That's it.
1127.376,1129.0860000000005,I would rather go low than go too high.
1129.086,1132.1309999999999,Place the orb of beef in the skillet and increase the heat.
1132.131,1136.0509999999995,"Using the spatula, press down until it is half an inch thick."
1136.051,1138.011,This is seeming so hot.
1138.011,1140.097,"Okay, we're cooling off."
1140.097,1140.4154090909092,160.
1140.4154090909092,1142.4320000000002,That's the lowest heat.
1142.432,1150.2740000000001,"This is obscene Cook without moving until it's achieved a deep, burnished crust and carefully turnover."
1150.274,1153.0680000000002,"I don't know if it's burnished, but it does smell like it's smoking."
1153.068,1154.236,Does it need more oil?
1154.236,1156.3209999999997,It's like ing burning.
1156.321,1157.656,"Oh, that got worse."
1157.656,1159.4909999999998,Is there another temp option?
1159.491,1161.451,Is this how this works?
1161.451,1162.5359999999998,I'm not burning it.
1162.536,1164.746,This is seasoning.
1167.332,1168.5000000000002,Is that a yes?
1169.793,1171.378,What are these for?
1172.254,1174.214,What do we have here?
1174.214,1175.924,A little bus tub.
1178.051,1179.3860000000002,You're so violent.
1179.386,1181.0960000000005,"You gotta get a therapist, room."
1181.096,1183.9320000000002,I know you're an inanimate object.

2210.249,2212.709999999999,It's more like a wall of bread.
2212.71,2214.795,I feel like I'm biting into the side of a couch.
2214.795,2215.12875,Yeah.

2237.276,2240.3210000000004,"No one's ever complained about extra bacon, which is kind of crazy."
2240.321,2241.6560000000004,"Well, I'm kind of allergic to bacon."
2241.656,2242.4899999999993,"No, you're not."

2270.643,2274.105000000001,The onion jam is adding a lot of sweetness.
2274.105,2277.0660000000003,"Like, remember the other one we were missing the condiment?"
2277.066,2278.401,Burger's not half bad.
2278.401,2282.863,It's not shaped in a way that anyone should ever shape a burger.
2283.823,2287.034,But it's much better than the last burger.
2287.034,2289.9959999999996,"It's not bad, but it's not seasoned."
2294.083,2294.7505,Yep.

2301.257,2302.2159999999994,Not really any carbonation.
2302.216,2303.05,This burger-

2305.4544545454546,2306.304,It has seasoning.
2306.304,2309.14,"The cream soda, it's still like watery but a lot better."
2309.14,2310.099,Look at that meat though.
2310.099,2312.435,"That's actually a good grilled meat, I think."
2312.435,2315.771,Maybe our bar has been lowered from the first experience.

2359.523,2360.608,And it is a good burger.
2360.608,2362.318,Could've used a little more seasoning.
2362.318,2363.4020000000005,The soda was good though.
