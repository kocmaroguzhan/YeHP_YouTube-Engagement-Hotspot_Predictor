00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.001
- This is concerning.

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.460
(bell dings)

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.378
Oh.

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:04.212
I heard a-

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:05.046
(bell dings)

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:05.880
Okay.

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.216
- [Gamemaster] Welcome, chefs.

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:10.427
You are trapped in this room.

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:15.390
If you want to leave, you must
bake a dish of my choosing.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.977
And I will do everything
in my power to stop you.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.437
- I burned my hand on the...

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.896
(egg thuds)

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.356
What the [bleep]?

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.441
What was that?

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.400
- Oh no!

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.484
- [Zach] Oh! I hate this.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:27.444
- What's your name?

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.030
(Zach screams)

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.115
Text me the best pic of your buns.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.324
Are we outside?

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:35.035
Am I going into a freezer?

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.244
- Are you about to strap...

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:37.203
What is...

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.539
Are you strapping me in?

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.498
- Oh no.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.251
(dramatic music)

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:56.306
- [Gamemaster] It's now
time to escape the kitchen.

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.480
- Hello?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.940
Oh. (chuckles)

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.902
Oh, we find ourselves back.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.320
- Okay.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.780
A kitchen.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.865
Single box there.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:14.949
It's maybe...

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.160
A couple of cameras.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.120
Classic kitchen stuff.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.706
It feels like maybe the
apron is the place to start.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:22.665
(Zach sighs)

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.000
- This is good.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.834
Okay.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:25.794
(item thuds)

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:26.628
Oh [bleep]!

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.546
What the hell was that?

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.299
(item thuds)

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.134
- Ha ha! Okay!

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:34.969
If we can just take a second.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.304
Stunning.

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:39.057
(dramatic music)

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:42.977
- [Gamemaster] Time to play cat.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.399
(items crashing)

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.902
Knock 10 items onto the floor.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:55.281
- Okay.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.116
Meow.

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:57.826
- Hi.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.037
Pay attention to me.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:01.871
Two.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:02.705
Oh, is that not enough?

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:03.540
Here we go.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.374
- Meow.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.211
(utensils clatter)

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.129
Meow. Meow.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.049
(utensils clatter)

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.134
- Six, seven.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.718
- Meow.

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:16.970
Meow.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.348
(printer whirs)

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:22.851
(Zach hisses)

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.936
Floor is lava.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.980
You know the rules.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.816
- Luckily you placed your stepping stones.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:30.900
No!

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.734
On the floor.

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:35.446
- Oh boy. (laughs)

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:36.281
Oh no!

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.158
Ah shit!

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.535
I should throw the paper on the floor.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:41.619
- Whoops.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.204
Okay. This is good.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:45.415
Here we go.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:46.374
Oh, this is fun.

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.835
Okay, so we'll sort of
skate, skate, skate.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.171
- Well, this is good
'cause one of my items

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.881
is a paper towel.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.466
(Zach grunts)

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.177
Oh, I'm [bleep]ing smart.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.387
- So that's sorta...

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:00.471
Hello.

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:01.973
How are you doing?

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.017
I'm Vic.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.686
Okay, it's going this way.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.147
Am I looking for a clue?

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:12.483
Let me see what we haven't used yet.

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:13.818
(bell dings)

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.028
- Oh [bleep].

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:18.865
I'm not Jared, I know
what that sound means.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.367
(Zach grunts)

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:24.662
A beautiful tomato.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:25.496
- This is concerning.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:26.706
(bell dings)

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.166
Oh, I heard a-

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.125
(bell dings)

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:29.959
Okay.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.045
Oh no.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:32.879
(bell dings)

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:33.713
Okay. And I hear you.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:34.547
Oh.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:35.381
(bell dings)

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.216
Is this it?

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.425
This is card stock.

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.509
There is nothing on...

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:39.344
Nope.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:40.803
And of course not.

00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:43.598
Ding.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:44.432
Is that this?

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:45.516
(bell dings)

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:46.351
Up there.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.435
Where is that coming from?

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:48.519
I feel like I'm in "Grey Gardens".

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.604
What is happening?

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.439
Okay. I am hearing dinging.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.523
(bell dings)

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:53.358
Ding.

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:54.943
Some food storage containers.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:55.777
Is it up there?

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:56.611
Oh!

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.445
Oh no! Oh no!

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:58.279
(Vic screams)

00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.113
No!

00:03:59.113 --> 00:03:59.948
Okay. Ah!

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:00.782
Ha ha! Okay.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.867
So we got this.

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.285
Perfect. Perfect.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.372
(printer whirs)

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.831
- Printer.

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.166
Okay. Be cool.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.627
(Zach grunts)

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.463
No, no, no, no.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:17.173
Egg. We got the egg.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:18.633
The egg is safe.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:19.467
Printer.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:21.177
Oh, okay.

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:22.512
I burned my hand on the...

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.097
(egg thuds)

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.181
What the [bleep]?

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.391
What was that?

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.850
- Step one, season.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.768
(bell dings)

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:29.602
Season!

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:30.436
Okay.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.733
Step one, season. Canola oil.

00:04:35.733 --> 00:04:36.567
Okay, great.

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:37.902
So I need some sort of a bowl.

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.613
(bell dings)

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.574
(Zach grunts)

00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:44.409
- Pickles!

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.120
I need to put you in a...

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.329
No, no.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.163
Oh my god.

00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:50.248
Oh...

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:52.709
I cheated. I'm sorry.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:53.793
You're in jail.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.753
- Oh shit. Okay.

00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:56.587
Yep.

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:57.922
And here we go.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:59.382
Season. Season.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.216
Okay.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.134
Bowl. Okay.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:03.386
Cleaning.

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:06.806
Are these up for grabs?

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:11.519
Here we go.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.353
Oh, you know what?

00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:14.063
If we're getting fancy, let's get fancy.

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:14.897
(item thuds)

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:15.732
Okay.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.695
- Open sesame.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:21.904
Who's sesame?

00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:23.990
Are you sesame?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.991
Open sesame.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:28.870
- Open sesame.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.414
Open sesame.

00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:33.583
Open sesame?

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:34.917
Ah!

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:35.752
Oh!

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:36.961
We're making hamburgers.

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:41.424
We are making hamburgers, I'm 95% sure.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:44.010
(Zach gasps)

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.678
- I found a thing.

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:47.889
A little sesame bun.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.975
(Zach growls)

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.310
A key.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.561
- Oh, gorgeous!

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.524
Oh, come on. Here we go!

00:06:00.234 --> 00:06:01.069
No.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.653
(bell dings)

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:03.488
No!

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.699
- Let's fricking party.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.410
Now it's all making sense.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.621
Okay, so eggs go over here.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.081
Meat goes over here.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.791
So step one, season.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:18.378
I have to imagine that's
seasoning my meat.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.837
Flop.

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:22.131
- Just need a little...

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.591
Okay.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.552
We are gonna season this up.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:27.387
Okay.

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:29.222
This is nice.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.056
Look at this.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.891
Okay, so you really
wanna get the seasoning.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:32.725
(bell dings)

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:34.310
This is gonna move.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.728
Of course. Ha ha!

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:38.731
[bleep].

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:39.816
Okay.

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.150
Okay.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.235
Something fall?

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.070
Two, take four ounces of beef.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.156
Gently gather into an orb
that is two inches in height.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:48.866
- Okay, I need to get
the pepper onto the meat

00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:50.785
without using my hands.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:58.751
This is smart.

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.337
So now I don't waste gloves,

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:05.174
but I don't contaminate my ingredients.

00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:07.009
I don't wanna like reveal

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:08.970
that I'm the world's smartest person here,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.180
but I think I'm making a burger.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.850
(printer whirs)

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.731
Want to cool this lava so you can walk?

00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:22.442
Yes, of course, I want to cool the lava.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.026
Please, room, please!

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:25.361
- Yeah.

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.572
I think I'm gonna, I
think I'm gonna have to.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:28.656
- Hey, ya, Vic.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:29.490
- No.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.700
- Oh yeah.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.534
- No.

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.244
- How's it workin' in here, huh?

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.788
I hear you got some lava
floor problems, huh?

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:36.747
- I do. What's your name?

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:37.832
- Me? Ah.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:38.666
I'm Oswald.

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:39.500
- Oswald.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.460
- Is this going on me?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.419
- No.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.378
You want it?

00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:43.212
- No. No.

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:44.046
- You want some on ya?

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:44.881
I can do it.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:45.840
Zachy boy.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.049
(Zach laughs)

00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:49.886
I brought a little bit of
ice for you to help you out.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:50.845
That all right?

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.305
- Thank you so much, penguin.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.890
- What'd you call me?

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.224
That's not my name.

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:57.310
Don't call me that.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.269
It's Oswald.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.979
- Yes, sir, Mr. Oswald.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:00.813
- Thank you.

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:01.772
All right, you're gonna
do great, all right?

00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:02.607
Keep working hard.

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:03.441
- Do you mean that?

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.275
(bell dings)

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.109
- [Oswald] I do. I believe in you.

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:05.943
- I really appreciate that.

00:08:05.943 --> 00:08:06.736
- Hey, keep it up, Vic.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:07.570
All right?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.280
I think that ding means something.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.114
- [Vic] [bleep].

00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:10.948
- [Oswald] Better be careful.

00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:12.033
- Is the floor not lava anymore?

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.367
- [Oswald] No, no. You're
safe to walk around,

00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:15.953
but better watch this
conveyor belt close, okay?

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:16.787
See ya, Vic.

00:08:16.787 --> 00:08:18.498
- Thank you, Oswald.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.834
I could not tell you what was in this.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:23.794
- Thank you, Oswald.

00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:24.629
(bell dings)

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:25.588
Ooh!

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:26.422
Bacon.

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:27.381
Oh my god.

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.091
This is the fattest bacon I've ever seen.

00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:30.051
Look at that.

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.135
(bell dings)

00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:32.845
Ah, I don't want to contaminate.

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.640
I don't wanna contaminate.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.351
(bell dings)

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.436
Away from the egg.

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:41.896
I have raw meat on my hands.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:44.148
Oh, right into the egg. Ah.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.193
I'm being responsible and safe.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.611
Oh shit. Oh shit.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.614
No.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:52.448
Oh.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:55.743
Today's video is brought to you by
 Cook Unity.

00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:58.120
Cook Unity connects
a diverse group of talented chefs

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.790
that cook delicious, inventive meals
fresh every day

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.250
in regional micro-kitchens,

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.834
not warehouse production facilities.

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:06.128
For Becky and I right now, we have a toddler running around.

00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:07.255
Dinner can be quite challenging.

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:10.800
So this has been such an easy thing to have
for us sometimes throughout the week.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.802
Just put it together.
It's reliably delicious.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.303
I think something that's great about it
is they have 

00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:16.556
different dietary preference filters

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.808
you can sort of cater
your service to everyone's needs.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:19.475
We love it.

00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:23.521
First up, Chef Jose Garce’s 
Cuban Lechon Asado.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.314
That is honestly so good!

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.400
The pork is fatty and tender. 

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.402
The sauce is
garlicky and a little bit

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.654
like tart and acidic.
 So delicious.

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.322
We— We don’t have plantains enough.

00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:36.450
Next up from Chef Admony,
the Middle Eastern Vegan Chili

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.412
with Tahini and green Sabzi rice.

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:40.663
Yeah, that's delicious.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:43.958
I also feel very healthy
eating this without compromising on taste.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.209
This tastes awesome.

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:47.962

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.888
(printer whirs)

00:09:57.888 --> 00:09:59.599
- All right, perfect.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:00.808
And...

00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:03.019
Put these on chef of course.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.604
- Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.188
What are you gonna do to me?

00:10:06.188 --> 00:10:07.148
(bell dings)

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:07.940
Uh-oh.

00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.737
Dark brown sugar. Okay.

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:16.490
- What do we think?

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.992
I kind of love it.

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:25.207
- [Gamemaster] Hop for the
prize, but not so high.

00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:28.044
Both feet must stay on the ground.

00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:31.505
- Oh.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.302
What is this balloon made out of? Steel?

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.136
Oh.

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:39.639
(Zach laughs)

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.184
(balloon pops)

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.268
Sick.

00:10:44.268 --> 00:10:49.273
(dramatic music)
(balloons popping)

00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:54.070
(slow-mo yelling)

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.196
- Did I do it?

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:58.324
This looks so good.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.786
For everybody keeping score
at home, do not worry.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:05.748
The Red Bull Capri Sun Lemonade
is still completely intact.

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.709
There is no stuff in it, so...

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:13.547
- Oh, I didn't, oh, I didn't
put the [bleep]ing hood on, huh?

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.884
I thought I was...

00:11:16.884 --> 00:11:17.968
Oh no.

00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:19.804
I thought I was wearing the hood.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.473
There's a little bit in my hair?

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:24.475
- Of course.

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:26.185
Dutch oven.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.604
♪ Dutch oven ♪

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.358
That seems glued down.

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.693
Oh, of course.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:34.527
Hello!

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.987
How are we doing?

00:11:36.987 --> 00:11:38.572
What's your name?

00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:40.032
For sure. Me too.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:40.866
Vic.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.955
- Chef's knife.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:46.789
Oh.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:51.252
Someone in that outfit silently
walking in with a knife,

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.547
I thought I was about to
have to fight for my life.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:55.381
- Spatula!

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.468
Ah, thank you.

00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:01.721
I'm going to call you Alex.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.848
Kelsey. Nancy.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.975
Nancy.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.309
Thank you, Nancy.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:08.144
Spatula.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:08.978
Okay.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.938
- Induction burner.

00:12:10.938 --> 00:12:12.148
Thank you.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.484
- Nancy, show me the cutting board!

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:16.694
Come on!

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:17.528
New Nancy.

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:19.989
I love that.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:20.823
Thank you.

00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:23.409
I know we haven't known each
other as long as the old Nancy,

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.994
but we're gonna be good friends.

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:25.828
I can tell.

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.288
- And this has my ingredients.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:30.583
- Half a slab of bacon diced into cubes.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:32.418
Okay.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.503
This looks infected.

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:36.088
And I feel great about that.

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:39.091
But fun fact, bacon has no germs in it.

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:41.469
- Damn, that's some fatty-ass bacon, yo.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.053
That's some thick cut.

00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:46.140
- I had another cutting board,
and it's got meat on it,

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.099
but I had meat.

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:49.435
It's gonna be more meat,
so I think that's fine.

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.270
Food safety is very important to me.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.813
It's sort of my number one thing.

00:12:52.813 --> 00:12:53.898
And this is sort of-

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:54.732
(bell dings)

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:55.566
The most important part.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:56.400
No!

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.234
Okay, hold on.

00:12:57.234 --> 00:12:58.068
(bell dings)

00:12:58.068 --> 00:12:58.903
Hold on.

00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:01.489
Okay.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.073
I have nine onions.

00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:07.286
(printer whirs)

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.497
Dice all the onions?

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.456
That's nuts.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:11.290
I can't.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.379
- Who are you?

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:18.714
- Finally.

00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:19.924
Music.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.008
Oh, legitimate music.

00:13:21.008 --> 00:13:22.468
Hello. Good morning.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.011
What's your name?

00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:27.181
(somber violin music)

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.060
- [Zach] 'Cause I'm cutting onions

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.395
and you think I'm gonna cry?

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:36.857
- I don't need to.

00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:39.068
It's a really beautiful song now.

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:42.655
- You will continue chopping
till we see you cry.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.825
(somber violin music)

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:52.456
It's so beautiful.

00:13:52.456 --> 00:13:53.290
Ow.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.628
Oh [bleep]. I didn't have to go that hard.

00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:58.838
- Okay.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.006
I'm a really good actor, so
here's what we're gonna do.

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:03.342
We're gonna manufacture this
because you didn't say how.

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:05.427
So I'm gonna act myself into crying.

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:06.637
So here's what we're gonna do.

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:07.972
Are you ready?

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:11.141
(somber violin music)

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:14.061
I just like...

00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:16.272
Sorry.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.982
I like, I think about like...

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.568
Being here with these onions right now.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:24.154
And this is actually my
first time having seen onions

00:14:24.154 --> 00:14:26.615
in a really, really long time.

00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:29.118
(Zach winces)

00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:35.207
- It's really lovely.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.209
Not enough?

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:42.131
(somber violin music)

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:52.600
It is just so beautiful.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.018
And the onions...

00:14:57.062 --> 00:15:00.149
- Life's funny that way sometimes.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:03.360
You meet people in the
most unexpected places.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.280
I'm just happy we have this moment.

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.576
God.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.036
Okay, there we go.

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:15.873
Do we still need four
onions for this recipe?

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:17.583
(Zach claps)

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.918
- Oh, thank you.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:21.128
Ooh.

00:15:21.128 --> 00:15:22.963
Step four! Yes!

00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:25.549
Set a dutch oven over medium
heat and add the bacon.

00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:28.510
- And cook until fat is rendered.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.221
This looks like a crime scene in here.

00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:33.891
- Step five, drain all
but one tablespoon of oil

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:34.725
from the pot.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:38.187
One and a half teaspoons of mustard seed,

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:41.148
two and a half tablespoons
of dark brown sugar,

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:44.109
and a quarter cup of balsamic.

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.319
- Add onions.

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.237
This is so many onions.

00:15:49.156 --> 00:15:50.491
Okay, perfect.

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:51.575
We don't have balsamic.

00:15:51.575 --> 00:15:53.911
So what are we going to use?

00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:57.373
I think the lemonade.

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:59.541
I want something with
sort of citrus in it.

00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:01.627
- Three tablespoons of water.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.963
I know it looks like this
is the tap water color,

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.923
but there is vinegar in here.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:06.757
This is not...

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:09.468
Our pipes are fine at 2nd Try.

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.260
- Fun fact.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.138
A cube of ice is perfectly
every time measured out

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:15.474
as one tablespoon of water.

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.059
Okay.

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:17.893
Okay.

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:18.978
- [Zach] Stir, cover, and cook

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.437
for as long as you possibly can.

00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:22.022
- But do not let it burn.

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:23.857
Don't let it burn, chef.

00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:25.442
And I won't.

00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:28.112
(printer whirs)

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.323
- Run with scissors?

00:16:33.867 --> 00:16:35.703
I don't have scissors.

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:39.164
- Run with scissors.

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:41.834
(pensive music)

00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:52.261
(Zach screams)

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:54.722
(Scissors giggles)

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:55.889
- Oh.

00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:56.724
- Hi.

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:58.308
- Hello. How are you?

00:16:58.308 --> 00:16:59.393
Okay.

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:00.227
Fun.

00:17:00.227 --> 00:17:01.061
What have we got?

00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:01.895
Running. Oh.

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:02.980
I'm catching ya!

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.814
Stop!

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:07.276
No, no! Wait!

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:08.986
- Am I supposed to follow him?

00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:10.487
Run with scissors.

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:14.783
- Hey! Hey!

00:17:14.783 --> 00:17:15.993
- I'm gonna get you.

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:17.703
I'm gonna get you.

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.413
I'm gonna get you.

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:20.622
I'm gonna get you.

00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:21.832
(Scissors giggles)

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:23.917
Come here, Scissors!

00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:26.336
(Vic laughs)

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:31.300
(Zach laughs)

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.135
(Scissors giggles)

00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:34.261
- What's your name?

00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:37.723
(Scissors giggles)

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.558
Hey! What's your name?

00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:43.103
- Here you go.

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:45.731
- Step seven.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.566
I wanna make sure I have
all of these pieces.

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:48.400
Step eight.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.860
Do you have anything in your pocket?

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.195
- [Scissors] No.

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.281
- Oh, bye, Scissor.

00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:57.242
Oh, there he goes, back to the wild.

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:58.327
Oh.

00:17:58.327 --> 00:17:59.661
Good luck, Scissor.

00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:01.246
Oh shit! My onions!

00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:03.957
- Whew.

00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:06.919
Here we go.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.337
Here we go. Okay.

00:18:09.838 --> 00:18:11.256
- Onions. Onions.

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:13.759
Oh, they didn't burn.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.718
They're beautiful.

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.804
The most beautiful onions there ever was.

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:19.515
- Add oil to a large cast
iron skillet over medium heat.

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:20.474
Doesn't say how much.

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.059
We follow our heart.

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:24.895
(Zach vocalizing)

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:28.690
If this doesn't have just a medium option,

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.192
I am going to cry.

00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:33.112
440.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.696
That is an oven.

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:35.906
We're talking oven temperatures.

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:38.242
I didn't even know you could
measure fire like that.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.660
I thought that was an oven thing.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.744
So 440.

00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:43.080
So medium heat would be two.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:45.332
That seems low.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.376
That's it.

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:49.086
I would rather go low than go too high.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:50.921
- [Zach] Place the orb
of beef in the skillet

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:52.131
and increase the heat.

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:53.090
- Using the spatula,

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.051
press down until it is half an inch thick.

00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:58.011
This is seeming so hot.

00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:00.097
Okay, we're cooling off.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:02.432
160. That's the lowest heat.

00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:04.393
This is obscene

00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:05.602
- Cook without moving

00:19:05.602 --> 00:19:08.689
until it's achieved a
deep, burnished crust

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:10.274
and carefully turnover.

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:11.483
I don't know if it's burnished,

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.068
but it does smell like it's smoking.

00:19:13.068 --> 00:19:14.236
Does it need more oil?

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.321
It's like [bleep]ing burning.

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.656
Oh, that got worse.

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.491
- Is there another temp option?

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:21.451
Is this how this works?

00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:22.536
I'm not burning it.

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:24.746
This is seasoning.

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:27.332
(bell dings)

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:28.500
Is that a yes?

00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:31.378
What are these for?

00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:34.214
- What do we have here?

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:35.924
A little bus tub.

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:38.051
(item thuds)

00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:39.386
You're so violent.

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:41.096
You gotta get a therapist, room.

00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:43.932
I know you're an inanimate object.

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:48.270
Catch.

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:50.105
Catch.

00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:51.440
(alarm beeping)

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.274
- [Gamemaster] Warning.

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:53.066
Ketchup.

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:54.276
Warning.

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.862
(gentle music)

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.824
- Oh! Oh!

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.534
Oh! Oh!

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.372
(Zach laughs)

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:08.207
Thank you!

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:10.167
More?

00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:18.258
(ketchup thuds)

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:19.218
No! Oh!

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:20.427
Oh!

00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:21.762
Oh shit.

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:22.596
Uh-huh.

00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:23.805
Yes, yes. More please.

00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:25.515
More. Yes, please.

00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:26.725
Yes. Thank you.

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:27.809
Uh-huh. Oh, I love it.

00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:28.769
Thank you so much.

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:29.937
More. More please.

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:31.271
Drizzle down on me.

00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:32.606
Oh, thank you.

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:34.066
Too much.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.652
(gentle music)

00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:42.115
- No.

00:20:42.115 --> 00:20:44.534
(Vic laughs)

00:20:47.704 --> 00:20:49.039
For our mustard.

00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.501
Our perfect mayo bucket.

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:54.962
- Now I know what it was
like to be my book cake.

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:56.546
That was crazy.

00:20:56.546 --> 00:21:00.133
- Okay, so this is all set, I think.

00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:02.386
Cooked through, perfect half inch.

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:03.720
My spatula.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.554
Order!

00:21:04.554 --> 00:21:05.514
(order printer whirs)

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:06.348
Up!

00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:18.694
- Order number one, one
burger, onion jam, lettuce.

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:19.778
Ah.

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:20.862
Is that...

00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:22.447
That's my bun, huh?

00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:23.282
The bun?

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.492
- That is the bun?

00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:27.911
The bun of that was the bun for this?

00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:30.122
With the key inside?

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:31.540
- This is my bun.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.167
That's...

00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:35.127
You've gotta be...

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.336
There's no way.

00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:38.297
(printer whirs)

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.131
- Okay.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.048
Ho, ho, ho.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:46.513
- [Gamemaster] Show me yours
and I'll show you mine.

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:48.974
(marble clanks)

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:51.810
Text me the best pic of your buns.

00:21:53.937 --> 00:21:56.481
- Nance, you sick mother[bleep]er.

00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:00.652
- I thought you'd never ask, room.

00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:04.489
It's about time we take this
relationship to the next level.

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:05.949
- Here we go.

00:22:05.949 --> 00:22:08.410
We have all this leftover meat.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.414
I'm gonna make somebody
think that I am so sick.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.377
(camera shutter clicks)

00:22:17.377 --> 00:22:18.211
Okay.

00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:22.674
- This is what we're working with here.

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:23.759
Are we happy?

00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:27.095
Oh, thank you!

00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:28.430
Oh, thank you, room.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.766
Okay, I want a number one burger.

00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.476
Onion jam and lettuce.

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:33.310
You got it!

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.397
- Oh, gorgeous pieces of
lettuce and some onion jam.

00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:40.776
People are gonna try and be
cheap with the onion jam.

00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:41.610
Not me.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:42.444
Order up.

00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:45.614
(order printer whirs)

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:48.241
Order number two.

00:22:48.241 --> 00:22:50.577
One burger tomato, lettuce...

00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:51.787
I only have one burger.

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:53.497
So I gotta make another burger. Okay.

00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:55.457
Oh, no, I'm also making a cream soda.

00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:56.291
No, no, no.

00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:57.334
There's pickles on this one. Okay.

00:22:57.334 --> 00:22:58.168
(bell dings)

00:22:58.168 --> 00:22:59.127
I understand what's happening.

00:22:59.127 --> 00:23:00.545
I understand. I got it.

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:01.380
Oh no!

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.214
Okay.

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:03.548
And this is better actually.

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:04.883
This is better.

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:06.468
- Oh [bleep].

00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:08.804
How many times are you
gonna make me do this?

00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:12.474
One burger, tomato, lettuce,
pickles, and a cream soda!

00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:14.309
Okay, coming up, chef.

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:15.644
(order printer whirs)

00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:16.853
Wait, I'm not done.

00:23:16.853 --> 00:23:18.814
I didn't even do the first one!

00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:22.025
Order three, one double cheeseburger.

00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:24.236
Oh, we gotta stop letting
them order the doubles.

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:25.320
They're getting greedy.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.405
(order printer whirs)

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:28.115
- Oh, no, you don't.

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:28.949
And you know what?

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:30.784
I know that that's
gonna be another burger.

00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:33.745
So we are gonna go ahead and do this.

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:35.080
Nance.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.665
No.

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:38.750
Nance, baby, help me.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.709
I need your help.

00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:41.420
You know I wouldn't ask if I didn't...

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.254
Okay.

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:43.713
We'll talk about that at home maybe.

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:45.424
- [Zach] Why am I putting
them down before I'm ready?

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:46.383
(bell dings)

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:47.175
Oh shit!

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:49.010
Oh shit!

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.597
Buns, buns.

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:53.557
Buns, buns.

00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:54.766
Buns. Too many buns!

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.726
- This is too many!

00:23:56.726 --> 00:23:58.562
Because this is making me worried about...

00:23:58.562 --> 00:23:59.771
(bell dings)

00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:01.857
I don't have enough meat for this.

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:02.941
Thank you.

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:03.775
All done!

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:05.360
- Oh my god. So many buns!

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.194
What the...

00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:07.654
How many burgers do you expect me to make?

00:24:07.654 --> 00:24:10.115
- Double cheeseburger? No.

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:10.949
And a cherry soda.

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:12.659
Where do I...

00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:13.994
Make sodas?

00:24:13.994 --> 00:24:15.454
A soda stream?

00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:16.913
Okay!

00:24:16.913 --> 00:24:18.498
Okay.

00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:19.958
Not the meat glove.

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:20.750
Oh no.

00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:24.212
- [Zach] Okay, let's make some other...

00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:25.422
(order printer whirs)

00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:26.882
Ah, no, no!

00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:28.091
Hey, hold the orders!

00:24:28.091 --> 00:24:29.551
We're not ready!

00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:31.386
Three cheeseburgers, one lemon...

00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:33.096
Oh my god. Oh my god.

00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:34.681
All right, you're gonna get in line.

00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:36.141
I'm just gonna crank the heat real quick

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:38.727
to make sure that I don't poison people.

00:24:38.727 --> 00:24:40.812
- People are not saying how
they want their burgers,

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:43.148
and so I'm assuming they
want the medium rare.

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:44.483
- Is this how I make soda?

00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:46.067
I don't have time for that.

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.903
I got hungry customers.

00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:49.362
- It auto turns on to 440.

00:24:49.362 --> 00:24:51.323
That's our problem here right now.

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:55.035
People are gonna be (coughs)

00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:56.328
So happy.

00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:59.039
(printer whirs)

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.248
- Time is not your friend.

00:25:00.248 --> 00:25:02.709
When the clock runs out,
you've reached the end.

00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:04.127
What clock? What?

00:25:05.795 --> 00:25:06.755
(bell dings)

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:08.006
Oh boy. Oh boy.

00:25:09.966 --> 00:25:11.301
15 minutes.

00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:12.511
- 15 minutes. That's actually great.

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:15.096
We're just gonna get a shit
ton of burgers on here.

00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:16.556
Perfect burger every time.

00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:19.392
And then just in case we
run out of burger meat,

00:25:19.392 --> 00:25:22.979
we are going to toss on one of these.

00:25:22.979 --> 00:25:24.314
Then here's the thing about customers,

00:25:24.314 --> 00:25:26.399
they just simply will
not know the difference.

00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:28.109
- One double cheeseburger.

00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:29.569
Oh shit! Cheese.

00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:30.403
Ah...

00:25:30.403 --> 00:25:31.238
(bell dings)

00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:32.155
(Zach screams)

00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:32.989
Stop it!

00:25:32.989 --> 00:25:33.949
Stop it.

00:25:33.949 --> 00:25:34.783
You're being...

00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:36.743
I can't multitask.

00:25:36.743 --> 00:25:38.828
So this wants to be a cheeseburger.

00:25:38.828 --> 00:25:40.413
That wants to be a cheeseburger.

00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:42.874
Tomato, lettuce, pickles.

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:45.085
Oh, I didn't even cut tomato.

00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:47.045
(Zach screams)

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.755
- [Vic] Listen, we're doing our best here.

00:25:48.755 --> 00:25:52.592
Double cheeseburger, tomato,
lettuce, and pickles.

00:25:52.592 --> 00:25:53.552
So we don't have pickles.

00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:55.512
So we're sort of creating something here.

00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:58.098
We want a little bit of the
tartness of that pickle.

00:25:58.098 --> 00:25:59.933
- Oh, I touched the raw meat!

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:00.767
Oh God!

00:26:00.767 --> 00:26:01.601
(order printer whirs)

00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:03.436
Oh! And the orders don't stop coming!

00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:05.522
Put me out of my misery!

00:26:05.522 --> 00:26:06.439
Oh!

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:08.650
I have to wash my hands now!

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:09.985
Oh, I hate this!

00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:11.194
Order number five.

00:26:11.194 --> 00:26:16.199
Two burgers, onion jam, lettuce,
tomato, one cherry soda.

00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:17.534
Oh!

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:19.995
I don't do well under pressure!

00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:20.829
- Oh, come on.

00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:22.163
Beautiful spread.

00:26:22.163 --> 00:26:23.248
It's like nice.

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.457
It's light, it's airy.

00:26:24.457 --> 00:26:26.042
That's what you want outta your ketchup.

00:26:26.042 --> 00:26:30.255
We have 11 minutes, which is
way more time than we need.

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:31.715
Then we have our mayo.

00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:33.049
And this, what we're gonna do

00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:35.135
is we're just doing a little
dip, dip around the rim,

00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:37.220
sort of like a margarita glass.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.179
Just like that.

00:26:38.179 --> 00:26:40.098
Pop that on top. Gorgeous.

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:41.891
- Time check. 10 minutes left.

00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:43.310
You two are done.

00:26:44.227 --> 00:26:45.437
Stay.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.439
And now you fliparooski.

00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:49.983
You off?

00:26:49.983 --> 00:26:51.067
Sort of hot.

00:26:51.067 --> 00:26:51.901
Pickles.

00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:53.111
Let's give you three pickles.

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:54.446
You're a growing boy.

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:55.614
Mustard. Mayo.

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:02.370
You're gonna get a little ketchup

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:03.955
and you're gonna like that.

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:05.290
And you're gonna like it.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.375
- Three cheese, two regos.

00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:09.210
And I can also prep these.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.170
One, two.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.589
And this is completely empty,
so we are just gonna do this.

00:27:12.589 --> 00:27:14.299
I love this plan.

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:16.259
Okay. This was a really good plan.

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:17.093
- Oh no.

00:27:17.093 --> 00:27:19.179
Where's my slip? Where's my slip?

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:20.263
We don't have time for this, room.

00:27:20.263 --> 00:27:21.973
We don't have [bleep]ing time for this.

00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:22.807
Come on.

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:23.642
Where's the slip?

00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:24.476
Where are you?

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:25.644
Show yourself.

00:27:26.686 --> 00:27:27.520
Where's the slip?

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.481
It was three cheeseburgers with something.

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:30.565
Three.

00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:32.776
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:34.235
I know there's one more.

00:27:34.235 --> 00:27:35.945
Oh, here it is. Oh, here it is.

00:27:35.945 --> 00:27:37.781
Oh no, that's a clue.

00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:39.115
Oh shit.

00:27:39.115 --> 00:27:40.700
Is this it?

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.868
Oh my god. No.

00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:47.082
Three cheeseburgers.

00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:48.541
Okay, I gotta wash my hands again.

00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:50.627
- Okay, cheeseburger.

00:27:50.627 --> 00:27:51.711
Cheeseburger.

00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:55.715
And of course, a cheeseburger.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.260
And of course, a little bit of mixture.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.845
Top bun, top bun, top bun.

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:03.932
People are, I think, not
gonna be excited at first,

00:28:03.932 --> 00:28:05.517
and I do think they're
gonna try them and be like,

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:06.726
"Oh, that wasn't so bad."

00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:07.686
Look at that.

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:09.396
Come on. That's not bad looking.

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:11.106
I feel really good about that.

00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:14.234
- And then I gotta make
these sodas in five minutes.

00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:15.443
Okay. Okay.

00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:16.277
All right.

00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:17.612
This is absolute hell.

00:28:17.612 --> 00:28:18.571
I am in hell.

00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:21.032
I have died and gone to hell.

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:22.742
- Cream soda.

00:28:22.742 --> 00:28:23.827
Perfect.

00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:25.036
There's water.

00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:26.996
Okay. Oh, I understand how this works.

00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:30.792
Okay, which one of these
do we think is cream?

00:28:31.918 --> 00:28:32.752
Cream.

00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:37.340
That's pretty good.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.677
- Okay, we got a bunch of
sodas that we need here.

00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:41.761
A cream soda.

00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:43.096
One, two, three.

00:28:45.098 --> 00:28:47.308
- Lemon lime soda,
cherry soda, cream soda,

00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:48.268
Lemon lime soda.

00:28:48.268 --> 00:28:50.228
This was something like that.

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:51.187
Lemon lime soda.

00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:53.523
I'm getting so much better at this.

00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:54.524
Cherry soda.

00:28:55.483 --> 00:28:56.317
Okay.

00:29:01.948 --> 00:29:05.034
- Double cheeseburger,
two cherry Cokes. Check!

00:29:05.034 --> 00:29:06.870
- One cherry soda.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.539
And then we have our burgers.

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:10.373
Okay.

00:29:10.373 --> 00:29:11.458
- Everybody loves cherry soda.

00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:12.375
Oh, oh, oh.

00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:16.379
We're outta the cherry soda.

00:29:16.379 --> 00:29:20.467
So we're just gonna go
ahead and water you down.

00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:23.928
Everybody loves a
watered down cherry soda.

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:25.388
- Oh, time is up.

00:29:25.388 --> 00:29:30.226
And good thing I am plated
before the buzzer even rings.

00:29:30.226 --> 00:29:31.561
Look at that.

00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:33.396
We are all done.

00:29:33.396 --> 00:29:38.109
We are so far done that my
work has been down and done.

00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:40.779
(buzzer buzzes)

00:29:41.654 --> 00:29:44.407
(dramatic music)

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.160
- Time's up.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.369
I've got the food, chef.

00:29:48.369 --> 00:29:49.454
Don't you worry.

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.663
I wasn't gonna worry.

00:29:50.663 --> 00:29:52.123
- Just put on a blindfold

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.708
and you'll get out of here in a hurry.

00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:55.668
That is concerning.

00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:56.503
- Okay.

00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:57.712
We're done?

00:29:57.712 --> 00:30:01.299
No little secret door this season. Okay.

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:03.510
How am I gonna eat all these burgers?

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.053
- I love this.

00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:06.137
Okay.

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:06.971
This is good.

00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:08.890
I think this went well.

00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:11.267
Oh.

00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:12.227
Nance, is that you?

00:30:12.227 --> 00:30:15.063
Oh, be honest, I don't
wanna fight anymore.

00:30:15.063 --> 00:30:16.773
Oh, come on, Nance.

00:30:16.773 --> 00:30:19.234
You say so many words without
saying anything at all.

00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:20.443
- Who's there?

00:30:20.443 --> 00:30:23.154
(pensive music)

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:24.989
Okay, you have a gentle touch,

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:29.160
but just know if you [bleep]
with me, I have a knife.

00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:31.621
- Are we outside?

00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:35.333
Nance, am I going into a freezer?

00:30:37.043 --> 00:30:37.877
Nance?

00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:42.465
- Oh boy.

00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:45.844
Are you about to strap...

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:46.761
What is...

00:30:46.761 --> 00:30:48.221
Are you strapping me in?

00:30:48.221 --> 00:30:50.807
- Nance, what's happening?

00:30:50.807 --> 00:30:52.016
What is going on?

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.601
Are these shin guards?

00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:56.312
- What could this possibly be?

00:30:56.312 --> 00:30:58.648
You're taking my shoes off?

00:30:58.648 --> 00:30:59.983
- These are shin guards.

00:30:59.983 --> 00:31:00.942
Oh my god.

00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:03.778
Nance, are we playing college soccer?

00:31:03.778 --> 00:31:06.614
Are you about to put me
in with like the USC team?

00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:08.074
- Hello?

00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:11.286
Okay, I'm taking my blindfold off.

00:31:11.286 --> 00:31:12.453
- Okay, ready?

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:15.081
- Oh, it's so bright.

00:31:15.081 --> 00:31:15.915
Ah [bleep].

00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:18.126
Ah.

00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:18.960
- No.

00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:20.795
- Oh no.

00:31:21.754 --> 00:31:22.589
- No.

00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:26.009
Oh no.
- Oh no.

00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:28.511
Oh no.

00:31:29.512 --> 00:31:31.598
What are they doing here?

00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:34.434
- Perfect.

00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:36.644
Oh my god. Perfect.

00:31:36.644 --> 00:31:37.729
Hello!

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:40.064
Welcome to the restaurant.

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.900
Okay, here we go.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.735
And shoes on.

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:45.320
(upbeat music)

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.863
- [Gamemaster] Welcome

00:31:46.863 --> 00:31:50.450
where you can enjoy premium
burgers and bubbly sodas

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.619
all from the seat of your car.

00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:53.453
Hold tight.

00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:55.997
Our waiters will skate right over.

00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:56.831
- Okay.

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:02.670
- [YB] Hello!

00:32:10.553 --> 00:32:11.387
- Over here.

00:32:11.387 --> 00:32:12.347
- [Zach] Uh-huh.

00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:14.432
What can I get for you today?

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:19.437
- I would like a burger, please,
with lettuce and onion jam.

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.439
- Burger with lettuce and onion jam. Yeah.

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:23.149
- [YB] You might wanna write that down.

00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:24.233
- Don't...

00:32:24.233 --> 00:32:25.693
Would love to.

00:32:25.693 --> 00:32:26.653
I don't need to.

00:32:26.653 --> 00:32:27.737
I don't need to actually.

00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:29.322
Burger with lettuce and onion jam.

00:32:29.322 --> 00:32:30.156
- [YB] Yeah.

00:32:30.156 --> 00:32:30.990

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.451

tomato, and some pickle.

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:34.786
- Of course.

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.120
And I got that.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.957
I did decide I actually
will be taking that.

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:39.791
Okay.

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:40.750
Burger. Whoa!

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.085
Lettuce and onion jam.

00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:43.294
- Double cheeseburger.

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:44.629
- Double cheese...

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:45.713
Double cheeseburger.

00:32:45.713 --> 00:32:47.298
- Careful on the side
of the car. Thank you.

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:48.132
- Uh-huh.

00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:51.094
- Double cheeseburger, lettuce,
mayo, mustard, ketchup.

00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:52.428
- Yes. And you're going so fast.

00:32:52.428 --> 00:32:54.013
And I love that for you.
- I'm in a rush.

00:32:54.013 --> 00:32:54.806
That's why.

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:55.890
- How are we doing?

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:56.975
- [Customers] We're hungry.

00:32:56.975 --> 00:32:58.434
- Hungry. Of course, of course.

00:32:58.434 --> 00:33:01.521
- Can I get a burger with
lettuce, pickles, tomato,

00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:02.605
and two cream sodas?

00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:04.190
- Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.149
(car horns honking)

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.984
And I'm listening.

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.068
- Hurry please!

00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:09.278
(car horns honking)

00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:10.738
- Okay, so we got two cheeseburgers

00:33:10.738 --> 00:33:13.074
with lettuce, tomato,
pickle, two creams, one-

00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:14.534
- [Customers] No, it's four! It's four!

00:33:14.534 --> 00:33:15.827
- Four burgers?

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:16.911
- [Customers] Four cheeseburgers!

00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:17.870
(car horns honking)

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:18.830
- Oh my goodness.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.039
I expect a big tip.

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:22.125
- Hello. Good morning.

00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:25.211
- Me and my friend are very...

00:33:25.211 --> 00:33:26.629
- You didn't tell me
you were coming today.

00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:27.463
I texted you.

00:33:27.463 --> 00:33:28.297
(everyone laughs)

00:33:28.297 --> 00:33:30.133
This is actually really [bleep]ed up.

00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:31.217
Ify got in a car accident,

00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:32.301
and I was like, "Ify, are you okay?"

00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:33.511
And Ify was like, "I'm fine,"

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:35.096
and then did not respond to my other text,

00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:36.931
so we'll talk about that later.

00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:39.058
- What can I get for you?

00:33:39.058 --> 00:33:40.518
- What are you doing?

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:41.853
- [Ify] I think I'm gonna do a burger.

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:42.687
- Yeah, yeah.

00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:43.521
- What kind of burger?

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:44.355
- What are you doing?

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:45.189
Can you close the door please?

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:46.524
Can you close the door?

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:47.859
- [Zach] I'm just gonna
get in here with you.

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:48.693
- Close the door.

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:49.527
- Oh.

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:50.987
This how y'all do business, huh?

00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:52.071
- All right, all right.

00:33:52.071 --> 00:33:53.406
I didn't know that was...

00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:54.240
- Burger.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.074
- Doesn't feel legal.

00:33:55.074 --> 00:33:55.908
- Burger.

00:33:55.908 --> 00:33:56.743
And this is locked.

00:33:56.743 --> 00:33:57.660
If you could open this.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.745
- No.

00:33:58.745 --> 00:34:00.329
- I'm kind hoping to...

00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:02.665
- No, I feel like you figured it out.

00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:03.875
So that's on you.

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:04.709
- Okay.

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:05.668
- [Vic] Garrick, you have a great day.

00:34:05.668 --> 00:34:06.502
Ify, [bleep] you.

00:34:06.502 --> 00:34:07.962
- Yeah. Okay. Wow.

00:34:07.962 --> 00:34:09.422
God damn!

00:34:09.422 --> 00:34:10.256
- Ouch.

00:34:10.256 --> 00:34:11.090
- Great service.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:11.924
- Okay.

00:34:11.924 --> 00:34:14.594
First car, we have a burger, OJ.

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:18.097
What does OJ mean?

00:34:18.097 --> 00:34:18.931
Onion jam.

00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:20.641
Here we go.

00:34:20.641 --> 00:34:21.476
And rock...

00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:22.560
- [YB] Oh my god!

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.271
(everyone laughs)

00:34:25.271 --> 00:34:26.355
- [Vic] Whoo.

00:34:26.355 --> 00:34:27.815
- [YB] That almost fell.

00:34:27.815 --> 00:34:30.777
- [Vic] Almost being the operative word.

00:34:30.777 --> 00:34:31.944
- And we're going to cream soda.

00:34:31.944 --> 00:34:33.404
What the [bleep] is the cream soda?

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:34.864
Probably this one. Probably this one.

00:34:34.864 --> 00:34:36.199
(car horns honking)

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:37.158
- Come on!

00:34:37.158 --> 00:34:38.868
- These people have never
been to a restaurant before.

00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:40.119
Where is their manners?

00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:41.079
- And we're never coming back to this one!

00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:42.038
- Good! You know what?

00:34:42.038 --> 00:34:42.997
And you're [bleep]ing,

00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:44.457
you're welcome to take
your business elsewhere

00:34:44.457 --> 00:34:45.291
if you don't like it!

00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:46.125
- Enjoy!

00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:48.211
- This soda is so watered down.

00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:50.421
- Thank you for noticing.

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:51.255
- Wow.

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:52.090
Thank you. Thank you.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:52.924
- Hello.

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:53.758
Garrick, which one was yours?

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:54.717
- [Garrick] They're both the same.

00:34:54.717 --> 00:34:55.676
- [Vic] They're both the same.

00:34:55.676 --> 00:34:56.511
Okay. Perfect.

00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:57.345
- [Garrick] Yeah.

00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:58.554
- [Vic] This one is Ify's.

00:34:58.554 --> 00:35:00.848
(everyone laughs)

00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:01.682
Enjoy!

00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:06.521
(car horns honking)

00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:08.106
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:11.067
Jesus Christ, bro.

00:35:11.067 --> 00:35:12.276
Jesus. What the...

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:13.361
Oh, wow.

00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:14.195
Wow.

00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:15.154
- So we have here-

00:35:15.154 --> 00:35:15.988
- Wow!

00:35:15.988 --> 00:35:16.948
- Two cherry sodas.

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:19.784
- It just is wet.
- Wow! Wow!

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.244
- Wet-ass burger.

00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:22.328
- Oh my god.

00:35:22.328 --> 00:35:23.788
- You ordered the WAB, right?

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:24.622
- [Garrick] Yeah, I did.

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:26.207
- [Ify] Yeah, yeah.

00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:27.792
- Enjoy!

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:28.876
- Oh.
- Oh no.

00:35:28.876 --> 00:35:30.336
- Is that finally ours?
- Yep!

00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:31.921
- Wait, are we missing a drink?

00:35:31.921 --> 00:35:32.755
- Yeah.

00:35:32.755 --> 00:35:33.589
- Another cream soda.

00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:34.423
- Did you order four?

00:35:34.423 --> 00:35:35.508
- Yeah.
- Cherry.

00:35:35.508 --> 00:35:38.594
- No problem. Cherry soda on its way.

00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:41.681
- I want my soda.

00:35:41.681 --> 00:35:43.432
That is so messed up.

00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:45.601
Hey, skates!

00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:46.936
- And here we go.

00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:48.521
One more soda.

00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:49.730
Wow. I did a perfect job.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:52.692
Everyone is so satisfied and so happy.

00:35:52.692 --> 00:35:54.652
(Zach sighs)

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:58.114
- Okay, well I think
that went pretty well.

00:35:58.114 --> 00:35:59.157
- [Gamemaster] Sit tight, chefs,

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:02.368
while our customers taste your dishes.

00:36:02.368 --> 00:36:05.037
(pensive music)

00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:09.709
- There's like nothing on it.

00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:11.294
Like, no ketchup. Nothing.

00:36:11.294 --> 00:36:12.128
- No ketchup?

00:36:12.128 --> 00:36:13.087
There's no condiments?

00:36:13.087 --> 00:36:17.175
It's so soggy I don't even want to eat it.

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:20.094
- I asked for mayo, ketchup, and mustard.

00:36:20.094 --> 00:36:22.138
And look at like, it's like an insult.

00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:24.098
Look how that bun just broke like that.

00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:25.308
This is terrible.

00:36:25.308 --> 00:36:26.142
- [Zach] Thank you.

00:36:26.142 --> 00:36:26.976
- There's ice.

00:36:26.976 --> 00:36:27.935
- There's ice on it.

00:36:27.935 --> 00:36:29.103
- Oh my god.

00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:30.688
Oh!
- Oh!

00:36:30.688 --> 00:36:31.522
- [Ify] Oh no.

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:32.356
- Oh shit.

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:34.692
There's no meat in it. (laughs)

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:36.110
- No way! No way!

00:36:38.279 --> 00:36:39.614
- What is that?

00:36:39.614 --> 00:36:41.574
That's like a sliver of meat.

00:36:41.574 --> 00:36:43.159
There's like a sliver of...

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:44.619
- Oh my god.

00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:45.953
That's actually a pickle sandwich.

00:36:45.953 --> 00:36:47.413
- Yeah, that's a pickle sandwich.

00:36:47.413 --> 00:36:50.249
- Okay. It tastes like absolutely nothing.

00:36:50.249 --> 00:36:52.710
- It's more like a wall of bread.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.795
- I feel like I'm biting
into the side of a couch.

00:36:54.795 --> 00:36:56.130
- Yeah. And it's so dry.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.342
- I mean, you got our
patties, it feels like.

00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:00.301
- You don't have meat?

00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:01.260
- We don't have meat in it.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.470
No.
- You gotta be kidding me.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.638
- Ew. Okay, no.

00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:05.848
- Just take some. Just take some.

00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:07.850
Why is it pink?
- Mushy.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:08.851
Are these cooked?

00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:09.936
It's a no for me, dog.

00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:10.895
- Oh, this is a no.

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:11.729
- Excuse me!

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:12.939
Your food is cold and soggy.

00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:14.774
There was bacon in mine
that I didn't order.

00:37:14.774 --> 00:37:15.608
- Cold and soggy.

00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:16.442
- Yes.

00:37:16.442 --> 00:37:17.276
- [Zach] Sorry.

00:37:17.276 --> 00:37:18.986
No one's ever complained
about extra bacon,

00:37:18.986 --> 00:37:20.321
which is kind of crazy.

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:21.656
- Well, I'm kind of allergic to bacon.

00:37:21.656 --> 00:37:22.490
- No, you're not.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.201
- Excuse me. There was
no meat in our burger.

00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:26.035
There was no-

00:37:26.035 --> 00:37:26.869
- [Zach] What are you talking about?

00:37:26.869 --> 00:37:27.703
- There was no burger

00:37:27.703 --> 00:37:28.663
in our burger.
- There was no burger.

00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:29.872
It was just buns.
- What are you talking about?

00:37:29.872 --> 00:37:31.040
Where did the meat go?

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:31.874
- [Ify] No meat.

00:37:31.874 --> 00:37:32.959
- Where did the meat go?

00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:33.918
And you know what?

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.127
When I find out who did this...

00:37:35.127 --> 00:37:36.337
- [Garrick] Okay.

00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:39.048
- I am livid for the both of you.

00:37:39.048 --> 00:37:41.717
(pensive music)

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:47.765
- Okay, it's not as
soggy as the other one.

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:49.475
Oh, it's actually quite
warm on the bottom.

00:37:49.475 --> 00:37:50.643
Mine's actually okay.

00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:54.105
The onion jam is adding
a lot of sweetness.

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:57.066
Like, remember the other one
we were missing the condiment?

00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:58.401
- Burger's not half bad.

00:37:58.401 --> 00:37:59.610
It's not shaped in a way

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.863
that anyone should ever shape a burger.

00:38:03.823 --> 00:38:07.034
But it's much better than the last burger.

00:38:07.034 --> 00:38:09.996
- It's not bad, but it's not seasoned.

00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:12.415
(Ify laughs)

00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:15.418
Yep. Yep.

00:38:15.418 --> 00:38:16.502
- That's meat.

00:38:16.502 --> 00:38:17.420
- Yeah, that's meat.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.254
- Okay.

00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:19.213
- This one's not bad.

00:38:19.213 --> 00:38:20.047
- You know?

00:38:20.047 --> 00:38:21.257
- There's a decent amount of syrup.

00:38:21.257 --> 00:38:22.216
Not really any carbonation.

00:38:22.216 --> 00:38:23.050
- This burger-

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:24.135
- It's nice and cold.

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:24.969
- It is better.

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.304
- It is cold.
- It has seasoning.

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:29.140
The cream soda, it's still
like watery but a lot better.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.099
- Look at that meat though.

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:32.435
That's actually a good
grilled meat, I think.

00:38:32.435 --> 00:38:35.771
Maybe our bar has been lowered
from the first experience.

00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:37.106
- Okay.

00:38:37.106 --> 00:38:38.941
- [Gamemaster] The votes are in.

00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:43.112
It's time to find out who
will escape the kitchen.

00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:45.990
- Oh.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.075
Oh, they're getting outta the car.

00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:48.909
- Whoo!

00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:49.744
- [Zach] Oh, they're coming to me.

00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:51.454
- Oh my god. What a good day.

00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:53.122
I didn't even see you earlier.

00:38:53.122 --> 00:38:53.998
- Yeah. Yeah. (laughs)

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.958
- Well, I'm so happy that
you're both here on my birthday.

00:38:55.958 --> 00:38:56.917
It's my birthday today.

00:38:56.917 --> 00:38:57.752
I wanna get that out

00:38:57.752 --> 00:38:58.711
in front right now.
- Oh, okay.

00:38:58.711 --> 00:38:59.670
It's your birthday. Got it.
- It's actually my birthday.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.504
- Yeah, yeah.

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:01.464
- Gentlemen, how was your meal?

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:02.673
- Oh, not great, man.

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:03.466
- Yeah, yeah.

00:39:03.466 --> 00:39:04.300
- Not great.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.134
So the onion was good.

00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:05.968
- [Ify] It was a little moist.

00:39:05.968 --> 00:39:06.802
- Moist.

00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:07.636
- Yeah. Very moist.
- Super moist.

00:39:07.636 --> 00:39:08.721
- A few thoughts on the burgers,

00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:11.807
which I wouldn't have
because my burger got-

00:39:11.807 --> 00:39:12.641
- [Vic] Dropped.

00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:13.476
- [Ify] Thrown out.

00:39:13.476 --> 00:39:14.310
- [Vic] Dropped. Fell.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:15.144
- [Ify] Yeah. Yeah.

00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:16.604
- Yeah, I was a little distracted
'cause it's my birthday.

00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:17.438
- Oh, okay.

00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:19.523
I did get to taste Garrick's burger.

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:20.608
And it is a good burger.

00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:22.318
Could've used a little more seasoning.

00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:23.402
The soda was good though.

00:39:23.402 --> 00:39:24.487
- The soda was fantastic.

00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:25.571
- We liked the soda.
- Oh, thank you.

00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:26.530
- Yeah, that was really good.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.365
- Oh, good.

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:28.199
- [Garrick] Good for you.

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.033
- I made that myself.

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:29.867
- You did?

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:30.826
- [Zach] I bubbled it and I squirted it.

00:39:30.826 --> 00:39:31.786
- You bubbled it?

00:39:31.786 --> 00:39:32.620
There was bubbles?

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.454
- Yeah...

00:39:33.454 --> 00:39:35.373
We were missing that.

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:37.458
We rate the quality of
food, which was great.

00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:38.918
But we also rate service.

00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:39.752
- [Vic] Right.

00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:40.586
- [Ify] And you were mean to me.

00:39:40.586 --> 00:39:42.421
- We're gonna tally the
votes from all the customers

00:39:42.421 --> 00:39:44.882
on whether or not you escaped.

00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:46.467
Did they escape? No.

00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:47.426
- [Zach] Which car was that?

00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:49.011
- Did they escape?

00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:49.845
Yes.

00:39:50.846 --> 00:39:52.431
- Come on. (kisses)

00:39:52.431 --> 00:39:53.265
Thank you.

00:39:53.265 --> 00:39:54.100
- Did they escape?

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.934
So that's hard no.

00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:55.893
- That one said "hard no."

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.228
This one said "absolutely not."

00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:58.062
- [Ify] Yeah, yeah.

00:39:58.062 --> 00:39:59.146
- That must have been from you.

00:39:59.146 --> 00:39:59.980
- Did they escape?

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:00.815
No.

00:40:00.815 --> 00:40:02.024
- No? That was you?

00:40:02.024 --> 00:40:03.359
- This one says no.

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:05.444
And I remember it's me 'cause I drew it in

00:40:05.444 --> 00:40:07.530
just in case they didn't see the X

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.824
so that you knew I meant no.

00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:11.659
- But, Ify, 'cause I remember
all the things you said

00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:13.994
that you loved about it specifically.

00:40:13.994 --> 00:40:14.829
- Yeah.

00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:15.663
Did they escape?

00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:16.497
Yes.

00:40:16.497 --> 00:40:17.331
- Okay.

00:40:17.331 --> 00:40:18.416
- Did they escape?

00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:19.750
Yes.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.710
- And then no and then no.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.920
So no.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.130
No, you don't escape.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:25.965

00:40:31.053 --> 00:40:32.263
A couple yeses.

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:33.097
- No.

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:35.307

00:40:35.307 --> 00:40:36.267

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:39.228

So congratulations.

- You stuck.

00:41:11.177 --> 00:41:12.136

(Ify and Garrick laugh)

00:41:44.418 --> 00:41:45.252
- Okay.

00:41:45.252 --> 00:41:47.838
And you three were my favorite.

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:50.925

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:02.728
(Zach sighs)

00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:05.940
All right, let's go clean the kitchen.

00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:08.817
(intense music)
- Look at this.

00:42:08.817 --> 00:42:10.486
- It seems like it’s an escape room.

00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:11.153
- No!

00:42:11.153 --> 00:42:13.030
- [Marissa screaming] 
- [Keith] It’s really more of a torture chamber.

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.657
- Are you strapping me in?

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:16.742
- You really had breakdowns in there.

00:42:16.742 --> 00:42:18.118
- [yelling] You know what we do with pirates?

00:42:18.536 --> 00:42:19.495
- I was having a hard time.

00:42:19.495 --> 00:42:21.080
- [Vic] Hey. Hey!

00:42:21.455 --> 00:42:23.207
- [Joyce] What the [bleep] is this?

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:25.626
- [Jonny] There’s a full-grown man dressed in a chicken suit.

00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:26.835
- [Vic] I did a perfect job.

00:42:26.835 --> 00:42:28.170
Everyone is so happy.
- (honking)

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:28.963
- Come on!

00:42:28.963 --> 00:42:31.507
- It’s impressive how bad you [bleep] this up.

00:42:32.007 --> 00:42:34.969
- We find ourselves at the start of this mountain path.

00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:37.638
- It’s Love At First Bite!

00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:39.014
- I’m ass up.

00:42:39.014 --> 00:42:40.849
- I couldn’t stop myself from peeing,

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:43.769
and peeing, and peeing, and peeing,
and peeing, and peeing, and peeing,

00:42:43.769 --> 00:42:45.145
and I pissed all over myself.

00:44:07.186 --> 00:44:08.145
Chefs.

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:09.396
You're not done yet.

00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:12.232
No! What?

00:44:12.232 --> 00:44:16.028
You should go on Instagram
and say the Try Guys gave me diarrhea.

00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:16.362
I'll do that

00:44:16.362 --> 00:44:17.696
even if it doesn't happen

00:44:17.696 --> 00:44:19.698
You must review your failures

00:44:19.698 --> 00:44:21.408
A kind of impressive lack of flavor.

00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:22.660
Oh it's stunning.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.788
And face the consequences of your actions

00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:27.665
What the [bleep] was going on with the eggs?

00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:32.586
Vic, do do I have your consent
to show a tasteful nude? Yes.

00:44:32.586 --> 00:44:34.046
I can’t wait!

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:38.008
It's now time to escape the aftershow.

00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:43.722
you declared that you were raised
by a single father and would never cry.

00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:46.058
right? So I think I won

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:51.105
(bright music)
