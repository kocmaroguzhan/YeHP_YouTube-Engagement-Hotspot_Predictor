744.994,745.828,I can tell.
745.828,747.288,And this has my ingredients.
747.288,750.583,Half a slab of bacon diced into cubes.
751.584,752.418,Okay.
752.418,754.503,This looks infected.
754.503,756.088,And I feel great about that.
756.088,759.091,"But fun fact, bacon has no germs in it."
759.091,761.469,"Damn, that's some fatty-ass bacon, yo."
761.469,763.053,That's some thick cut.
763.053,766.14,"I had another cutting board, and it's got meat on it,"
766.14,767.099,but I had meat.
767.099,769.435,"It's gonna be more meat, so I think that's fine."
769.435,771.27,Food safety is very important to me.
771.27,772.813,It's sort of my number one thing.
772.813,773.898,And this is sort of-
774.732,775.566,The most important part.
775.566,776.4,No!
776.4,777.234,"Okay, hold on."
778.068,778.903,Hold on.
780.654,781.489,Okay.
781.489,783.073,I have nine onions.
787.286,789.497,Dice all the onions?
789.497,790.456,That's nuts.
790.456,791.29,I can't.
796.17,797.379,Who are you?
797.379,798.714,Finally.
798.714,799.924,Music.
799.924,801.008,"Oh, legitimate music."
801.008,802.468,Hello. Good morning.
802.468,804.011,What's your name?
810.1,811.06,'Cause I'm cutting onions
811.06,813.395,and you think I'm gonna cry?
815.147,816.857,I don't need to.
816.857,819.068,It's a really beautiful song now.
819.068,822.655,You will continue chopping till we see you cry.
831.372,832.456,It's so beautiful.
832.456,833.29,Ow.
835.668,837.628,Oh . I didn't have to go that hard.
837.628,838.838,Okay.
838.838,841.006,"I'm a really good actor, so here's what we're gonna do."
841.006,843.342,We're gonna manufacture this because you didn't say how.
843.342,845.427,So I'm gonna act myself into crying.
845.427,846.637,So here's what we're gonna do.
846.637,847.972,Are you ready?
852.893,854.061,I just like...
855.437,856.272,Sorry.
856.272,857.982,"I like, I think about like..."
857.982,860.568,Being here with these onions right now.
860.568,864.154,And this is actually my first time having seen onions
864.154,866.615,"in a really, really long time."
873.455,875.207,It's really lovely.
876.292,877.209,Not enough?
890.264,892.6,It is just so beautiful.
892.6,894.018,And the onions...
897.062,900.149,Life's funny that way sometimes.
900.149,903.36,You meet people in the most unexpected places.
903.36,906.28,I'm just happy we have this moment.
909.074,910.576,God.
910.576,912.036,"Okay, there we go."
912.036,915.873,Do we still need four onions for this recipe?
917.583,918.918,"Oh, thank you."
920.044,921.128,Ooh.
921.128,922.963,Step four! Yes!
922.963,925.549,Set a dutch oven over medium heat and add the bacon.
925.549,928.51,And cook until fat is rendered.
928.51,931.221,This looks like a crime scene in here.
931.221,933.891,"Step five, drain all but one tablespoon of oil"
933.891,934.725,from the pot.
934.725,938.187,"One and a half teaspoons of mustard seed,"
938.187,941.148,"two and a half tablespoons of dark brown sugar,"
941.148,944.109,and a quarter cup of balsamic.
944.109,945.319,Add onions.
945.319,947.237,This is so many onions.
949.156,950.491,"Okay, perfect."
950.491,951.575,We don't have balsamic.
951.575,953.911,So what are we going to use?
955.037,957.373,I think the lemonade.
957.373,959.541,I want something with sort of citrus in it.
959.541,961.627,Three tablespoons of water.
961.627,963.963,"I know it looks like this is the tap water color,"
963.963,965.923,but there is vinegar in here.
965.923,966.757,This is not...
966.757,969.468,Our pipes are fine at 2nd Try.
969.468,970.26,Fun fact.
970.26,973.138,A cube of ice is perfectly every time measured out
973.138,975.474,as one tablespoon of water.
975.474,977.059,Okay.
977.059,977.893,Okay.
977.893,978.978,"Stir, cover, and cook"
978.978,980.437,for as long as you possibly can.
980.437,982.022,But do not let it burn.
982.022,983.857,"Don't let it burn, chef."
983.857,985.442,And I won't.
989.655,991.323,Run with scissors?
993.867,995.703,I don't have scissors.
997.705,999.164,Run with scissors.
1014.722,1015.889,Oh.
1015.889,1016.724,Hi.
1016.724,1018.308,Hello. How are you?
1018.308,1019.393,Okay.
1019.393,1020.227,Fun.
1020.227,1021.061,What have we got?
1021.061,1021.895,Running. Oh.
1021.895,1022.98,I'm catching ya!
1022.98,1023.814,Stop!
1026.442,1027.276,"No, no! Wait!"
1027.276,1028.986,Am I supposed to follow him?
1028.986,1030.487,Run with scissors.
1033.198,1034.783,Hey! Hey!
1034.783,1035.993,I'm gonna get you.
1035.993,1037.703,I'm gonna get you.
1037.703,1039.413,I'm gonna get you.
1039.413,1040.622,I'm gonna get you.
1041.832,1043.917,"Come here, Scissors!"
1053.135,1054.261,What's your name?
1057.723,1059.558,Hey! What's your name?
1061.935,1063.103,Here you go.
1064.897,1065.731,Step seven.
1065.731,1067.566,I wanna make sure I have all of these pieces.
1067.566,1068.4,Step eight.
1068.4,1069.86,Do you have anything in your pocket?
1069.86,1071.195,No.
1072.446,1074.281,"Oh, bye, Scissor."
1074.281,1077.242,"Oh, there he goes, back to the wild."
1077.242,1078.327,Oh.
1078.327,1079.661,"Good luck, Scissor."
1079.661,1081.246,Oh shit! My onions!
1083.123,1083.957,Whew.
1085.709,1086.919,Here we go.
1086.919,1088.337,Here we go. Okay.
1089.838,1091.256,Onions. Onions.
1092.424,1093.759,"Oh, they didn't burn."
1093.759,1094.718,They're beautiful.
1094.718,1096.804,The most beautiful onions there ever was.
1096.804,1099.515,Add oil to a large cast iron skillet over medium heat.
1099.515,1100.474,Doesn't say how much.
1100.474,1102.059,We follow our heart.
1106.772,1108.69,"If this doesn't have just a medium option,"
1108.69,1110.192,I am going to cry.
1112.152,1113.112,440.
1113.112,1114.696,That is an oven.
1114.696,1115.906,We're talking oven temperatures.
1115.906,1118.242,I didn't even know you could measure fire like that.
1118.242,1119.66,I thought that was an oven thing.
1119.66,1120.744,So 440.
1120.744,1123.08,So medium heat would be two.
1124.081,1125.332,That seems low.
1126.542,1127.376,That's it.
1127.376,1129.086,I would rather go low than go too high.
1129.086,1130.921,Place the orb of beef in the skillet
1130.921,1132.131,and increase the heat.
1132.131,1133.09,"Using the spatula,"
1133.09,1136.051,press down until it is half an inch thick.
1136.051,1138.011,This is seeming so hot.
1138.011,1140.097,"Okay, we're cooling off."
1140.097,1142.432,160. That's the lowest heat.
1142.432,1144.393,This is obscene
1144.393,1145.602,Cook without moving
1145.602,1148.689,"until it's achieved a deep, burnished crust"
1148.689,1150.274,and carefully turnover.
1150.274,1151.483,"I don't know if it's burnished,"
1151.483,1153.068,but it does smell like it's smoking.
1153.068,1154.236,Does it need more oil?
1154.236,1156.321,It's like ing burning.
1156.321,1157.656,"Oh, that got worse."
1157.656,1159.491,Is there another temp option?
1159.491,1161.451,Is this how this works?
1161.451,1162.536,I'm not burning it.
1162.536,1164.746,This is seasoning.
1167.332,1168.5,Is that a yes?
1169.793,1171.378,What are these for?
1172.254,1174.214,What do we have here?
1174.214,1175.924,A little bus tub.
1178.051,1179.386,You're so violent.
1179.386,1181.096,"You gotta get a therapist, room."
1181.096,1183.932,I know you're an inanimate object.
1187.436,1188.27,Catch.
1189.271,1190.105,Catch.
1191.44,1192.274,Warning.
1192.274,1193.066,Ketchup.
1193.066,1194.276,Warning.
1199.99,1200.824,Oh! Oh!
1201.7,1202.534,Oh! Oh!
1207.372,1208.207,Thank you!
1209.333,1210.167,More?
1218.258,1219.218,No! Oh!
1219.218,1220.427,Oh!
1220.427,1221.762,Oh shit.
1221.762,1222.596,Uh-huh.
1222.596,1223.805,"Yes, yes. More please."
1223.805,1225.515,"More. Yes, please."
1225.515,1226.725,Yes. Thank you.
1226.725,1227.809,"Uh-huh. Oh, I love it."
1227.809,1228.769,Thank you so much.
1228.769,1229.937,More. More please.
1229.937,1231.271,Drizzle down on me.
1231.271,1232.606,"Oh, thank you."
1232.606,1234.066,Too much.
1241.156,1242.115,No.
1247.704,1249.039,For our mustard.
1251.166,1252.501,Our perfect mayo bucket.
1252.501,1254.962,Now I know what it was like to be my book cake.
1254.962,1256.546,That was crazy.
1256.546,1260.133,"Okay, so this is all set, I think."
1260.133,1262.386,"Cooked through, perfect half inch."
1262.386,1263.72,My spatula.
1263.72,1264.554,Order!
1265.514,1266.348,Up!
1274.856,1278.694,"Order number one, one burger, onion jam, lettuce."
1278.694,1279.778,Ah.
1279.778,1280.862,Is that...
1280.862,1282.447,"That's my bun, huh?"
1282.447,1283.282,The bun?
1284.283,1285.492,That is the bun?
1285.492,1287.911,The bun of that was the bun for this?
1287.911,1290.122,With the key inside?
1290.122,1291.54,This is my bun.
1292.958,1294.167,That's...
1294.167,1295.127,You've gotta be...
1295.127,1296.336,There's no way.
1298.297,1299.131,Okay.
1299.131,1300.048,"Ho, ho, ho."
1303.302,1306.513,Show me yours and I'll show you mine.
1308.974,1311.81,Text me the best pic of your buns.
1313.937,1316.481,"Nance, you sick motherer."
1317.816,1320.652,"I thought you'd never ask, room."
1321.528,1324.489,It's about time we take this relationship to the next level.
1324.489,1325.949,Here we go.
1325.949,1328.41,We have all this leftover meat.
1328.41,1332.414,I'm gonna make somebody think that I am so sick.
1337.377,1338.211,Okay.
1340.088,1342.674,This is what we're working with here.
1342.674,1343.759,Are we happy?
1345.635,1347.095,"Oh, thank you!"
1347.095,1348.43,"Oh, thank you, room."
1348.43,1350.766,"Okay, I want a number one burger."
1350.766,1352.476,Onion jam and lettuce.
1352.476,1353.31,You got it!
1353.31,1357.397,"Oh, gorgeous pieces of lettuce and some onion jam."
1357.397,1360.776,People are gonna try and be cheap with the onion jam.
1360.776,1361.61,Not me.
1361.61,1362.444,Order up.
1367.157,1368.241,Order number two.
1368.241,1370.577,"One burger tomato, lettuce..."
1370.577,1371.787,I only have one burger.
1371.787,1373.497,So I gotta make another burger. Okay.
1373.497,1375.457,"Oh, no, I'm also making a cream soda."
1375.457,1376.291,"No, no, no."
1376.291,1377.334,There's pickles on this one. Okay.
1378.168,1379.127,I understand what's happening.
1379.127,1380.545,I understand. I got it.
1380.545,1381.38,Oh no!
1381.38,1382.214,Okay.
1382.214,1383.548,And this is better actually.
1383.548,1384.883,This is better.
1384.883,1386.468,Oh .
1386.468,1388.804,How many times are you gonna make me do this?
1388.804,1392.474,"One burger, tomato, lettuce, pickles, and a cream soda!"
1392.474,1394.309,"Okay, coming up, chef."
1395.644,1396.853,"Wait, I'm not done."
1396.853,1398.814,I didn't even do the first one!
1398.814,1402.025,"Order three, one double cheeseburger."
1402.025,1404.236,"Oh, we gotta stop letting them order the doubles."
1404.236,1405.32,They're getting greedy.
1406.405,1408.115,"Oh, no, you don't."
1408.115,1408.949,And you know what?
1408.949,1410.784,I know that that's gonna be another burger.
1410.784,1413.745,So we are gonna go ahead and do this.
1413.745,1415.08,Nance.
1415.08,1416.665,No.
1416.665,1418.75,"Nance, baby, help me."
1418.75,1419.709,I need your help.
1419.709,1421.42,You know I wouldn't ask if I didn't...
1421.42,1422.254,Okay.
1422.254,1423.713,We'll talk about that at home maybe.
1423.713,1425.424,Why am I putting them down before I'm ready?
1426.383,1427.175,Oh shit!
1428.176,1429.01,Oh shit!
1431.263,1432.597,"Buns, buns."
1432.597,1433.557,"Buns, buns."
1433.557,1434.766,Buns. Too many buns!
1434.766,1436.726,This is too many!
1436.726,1438.562,Because this is making me worried about...
1439.771,1441.857,I don't have enough meat for this.
1441.857,1442.941,Thank you.
1442.941,1443.775,All done!
1443.775,1445.36,Oh my god. So many buns!
1445.36,1446.194,What the...
1446.194,1447.654,How many burgers do you expect me to make?
1447.654,1450.115,Double cheeseburger? No.
1450.115,1450.949,And a cherry soda.
1450.949,1452.659,Where do I...
1452.659,1453.994,Make sodas?
1453.994,1455.454,A soda stream?
1455.454,1456.913,Okay!
1456.913,1458.498,Okay.
1458.498,1459.958,Not the meat glove.
1459.958,1460.75,Oh no.
1462.377,1464.212,"Okay, let's make some other..."
1465.422,1466.882,"Ah, no, no!"
1466.882,1468.091,"Hey, hold the orders!"
1468.091,1469.551,We're not ready!
1469.551,1471.386,"Three cheeseburgers, one lemon..."
1471.386,1473.096,Oh my god. Oh my god.
1473.096,1474.681,"All right, you're gonna get in line."
1474.681,1476.141,I'm just gonna crank the heat real quick
1476.141,1478.727,to make sure that I don't poison people.
1478.727,1480.812,"People are not saying how they want their burgers,"
1480.812,1483.148,and so I'm assuming they want the medium rare.
1483.148,1484.483,Is this how I make soda?
1484.483,1486.067,I don't have time for that.
1486.067,1487.903,I got hungry customers.
1487.903,1489.362,It auto turns on to 440.
1489.362,1491.323,That's our problem here right now.
1491.323,1495.035,People are gonna be
1495.035,1496.328,So happy.
1499.039,1500.248,Time is not your friend.
1500.248,1502.709,"When the clock runs out, you've reached the end."
1502.709,1504.127,What clock? What?
1506.755,1508.006,Oh boy. Oh boy.
1509.966,1511.301,15 minutes.
1511.301,1512.511,15 minutes. That's actually great.
1512.511,1515.096,We're just gonna get a shit ton of burgers on here.
1515.096,1516.556,Perfect burger every time.
1516.556,1519.392,"And then just in case we run out of burger meat,"
1519.392,1522.979,we are going to toss on one of these.
1522.979,1524.314,"Then here's the thing about customers,"
1524.314,1526.399,they just simply will not know the difference.
1526.399,1528.109,One double cheeseburger.
1528.109,1529.569,Oh shit! Cheese.
1529.569,1530.403,Ah...
1532.155,1532.989,Stop it!
1532.989,1533.949,Stop it.
1533.949,1534.783,You're being...
1534.783,1536.743,I can't multitask.
1536.743,1538.828,So this wants to be a cheeseburger.
1538.828,1540.413,That wants to be a cheeseburger.
1540.413,1542.874,"Tomato, lettuce, pickles."
1542.874,1545.085,"Oh, I didn't even cut tomato."
1547.045,1548.755,"Listen, we're doing our best here."
1548.755,1552.592,"Double cheeseburger, tomato, lettuce, and pickles."
1552.592,1553.552,So we don't have pickles.
1553.552,1555.512,So we're sort of creating something here.
1555.512,1558.098,We want a little bit of the tartness of that pickle.
1558.098,1559.933,"Oh, I touched the raw meat!"
1559.933,1560.767,Oh God!
1561.601,1563.436,Oh! And the orders don't stop coming!
1563.436,1565.522,Put me out of my misery!
1565.522,1566.439,Oh!
1566.439,1568.65,I have to wash my hands now!
1568.65,1569.985,"Oh, I hate this!"
1569.985,1571.194,Order number five.
1571.194,1576.199,"Two burgers, onion jam, lettuce, tomato, one cherry soda."
1576.533,1577.534,Oh!
1577.534,1579.995,I don't do well under pressure!
1579.995,1580.829,"Oh, come on."
1580.829,1582.163,Beautiful spread.
1582.163,1583.248,It's like nice.
1583.248,1584.457,"It's light, it's airy."
1584.457,1586.042,That's what you want outta your ketchup.
1586.042,1590.255,"We have 11 minutes, which is way more time than we need."
1590.255,1591.715,Then we have our mayo.
1591.715,1593.049,"And this, what we're gonna do"
1593.049,1595.135,"is we're just doing a little dip, dip around the rim,"
1595.135,1597.22,sort of like a margarita glass.
1597.22,1598.179,Just like that.
1598.179,1600.098,Pop that on top. Gorgeous.
1600.098,1601.891,Time check. 10 minutes left.
1601.891,1603.31,You two are done.

1611.901,1613.111,Let's give you three pickles.
1613.111,1614.446,You're a growing boy.
1614.446,1615.614,Mustard. Mayo.
1620.785,1622.37,You're gonna get a little ketchup
1622.37,1623.955,and you're gonna like that.
1623.955,1625.29,And you're gonna like it.
1625.29,1627.375,"Three cheese, two regos."
1627.375,1629.21,And I can also prep these.
1629.21,1630.17,"One, two."
1630.17,1632.589,"And this is completely empty, so we are just gonna do this."
1632.589,1634.299,I love this plan.
1634.299,1636.259,Okay. This was a really good plan.
1636.259,1637.093,Oh no.
1637.093,1639.179,Where's my slip? Where's my slip?
1639.179,1640.263,"We don't have time for this, room."
1640.263,1641.973,We don't have ing time for this.
1641.973,1642.807,Come on.
1642.807,1643.642,Where's the slip?
1643.642,1644.476,Where are you?
1644.476,1645.644,Show yourself.
1646.686,1647.52,Where's the slip?
1647.52,1649.481,It was three cheeseburgers with something.
1649.481,1650.565,Three.
1650.565,1652.776,"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy."
1652.776,1654.235,I know there's one more.
1654.235,1655.945,"Oh, here it is. Oh, here it is."
1655.945,1657.781,"Oh no, that's a clue."

1673.213,1675.715,"And of course, a cheeseburger."
1676.8,1679.26,"And of course, a little bit of mixture."
1679.26,1680.845,"Top bun, top bun, top bun."
1680.845,1683.932,"People are, I think, not gonna be excited at first,"
1683.932,1685.517,"and I do think they're gonna try them and be like,"
1685.517,1686.726,"""Oh, that wasn't so bad."""
1686.726,1687.686,Look at that.
1687.686,1689.396,Come on. That's not bad looking.
1689.396,1691.106,I feel really good about that.
1691.106,1694.234,And then I gotta make these sodas in five minutes.
1694.234,1695.443,Okay. Okay.

2046.502,2047.962,Yeah. Okay. Wow.
2047.962,2049.422,God damn!
2049.422,2050.256,Ouch.
2050.256,2051.09,Great service.
2051.09,2051.924,Okay.
2051.924,2054.594,"First car, we have a burger, OJ."
2056.888,2058.097,What does OJ mean?
2058.097,2058.931,Onion jam.
2058.931,2060.641,Here we go.
2060.641,2061.476,And rock...

2066.355,2067.815,That almost fell.
2067.815,2070.777,Almost being the operative word.
2070.777,2071.944,And we're going to cream soda.
2071.944,2073.404,What the is the cream soda?
2073.404,2074.864,Probably this one. Probably this one.
2076.199,2077.158,Come on!
2077.158,2078.868,These people have never been to a restaurant before.
2078.868,2080.119,Where is their manners?
2080.119,2081.079,And we're never coming back to this one!
2081.079,2082.038,Good! You know what?
2082.038,2082.997,"And you're ing,"
2082.997,2084.457,you're welcome to take your business elsewhere
2084.457,2085.291,if you don't like it!
2085.291,2086.125,Enjoy!
2086.125,2088.211,This soda is so watered down.
2088.211,2090.421,Thank you for noticing.
2090.421,2091.255,Wow.
2091.255,2092.09,Thank you. Thank you.
2092.09,2092.924,Hello.
2092.924,2093.758,"Garrick, which one was yours?"
2093.758,2094.717,They're both the same.
2094.717,2095.676,They're both the same.
2095.676,2096.511,Okay. Perfect.
2096.511,2097.345,Yeah.
2097.345,2098.554,This one is Ify's.
2100.848,2101.682,Enjoy!
2106.521,2108.106,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
2109.357,2111.067,"Jesus Christ, bro."
2111.067,2112.276,Jesus. What the...
2112.276,2113.361,"Oh, wow."
2113.361,2114.195,Wow.
2114.195,2115.154,So we have here-
2115.154,2115.988,Wow!
2115.988,2116.948,Two cherry sodas.
2116.948,2119.784,It just is wet. Wow! Wow!
2119.784,2121.244,Wet-ass burger.
2121.244,2122.328,Oh my god.
2122.328,2123.788,"You ordered the WAB, right?"
2123.788,2124.622,"Yeah, I did."
2124.622,2126.207,"Yeah, yeah."
2126.207,2127.792,Enjoy!
2127.792,2128.876,Oh. Oh no.
2128.876,2130.336,Is that finally ours? Yep!
2130.336,2131.921,"Wait, are we missing a drink?"
2131.921,2132.755,Yeah.
2132.755,2133.589,Another cream soda.
2133.589,2134.423,Did you order four?
2134.423,2135.508,Yeah. Cherry.
2135.508,2138.594,No problem. Cherry soda on its way.
2139.846,2141.681,I want my soda.
2141.681,2143.432,That is so messed up.
2144.392,2145.601,"Hey, skates!"
2145.601,2146.936,And here we go.
2146.936,2148.521,One more soda.
2148.521,2149.73,Wow. I did a perfect job.
2149.73,2152.692,Everyone is so satisfied and so happy.
2154.652,2158.114,"Okay, well I think that went pretty well."
2158.114,2159.157,"Sit tight, chefs,"
2159.157,2162.368,while our customers taste your dishes.
2168.249,2169.709,There's like nothing on it.
2169.709,2171.294,"Like, no ketchup. Nothing."
2171.294,2172.128,No ketchup?
2172.128,2173.087,There's no condiments?
2173.087,2177.175,It's so soggy I don't even want to eat it.
2177.175,2180.094,"I asked for mayo, ketchup, and mustard."
2180.094,2182.138,"And look at like, it's like an insult."
2182.138,2184.098,Look how that bun just broke like that.
2184.098,2185.308,This is terrible.
2185.308,2186.142,Thank you.
2186.142,2186.976,There's ice.
2186.976,2187.935,There's ice on it.
2187.935,2189.103,Oh my god.
2189.103,2190.688,Oh! Oh!
2190.688,2191.522,Oh no.
2191.522,2192.356,Oh shit.
2192.356,2194.692,There's no meat in it.
2194.692,2196.11,No way! No way!
2198.279,2199.614,What is that?
2199.614,2201.574,That's like a sliver of meat.
2201.574,2203.159,There's like a sliver of...
2203.159,2204.619,Oh my god.
2204.619,2205.953,That's actually a pickle sandwich.
2205.953,2207.413,"Yeah, that's a pickle sandwich."
2207.413,2210.249,Okay. It tastes like absolutely nothing.
2210.249,2212.71,It's more like a wall of bread.
2212.71,2214.795,I feel like I'm biting into the side of a couch.
2214.795,2216.13,Yeah. And it's so dry.
2216.13,2219.342,"I mean, you got our patties, it feels like."
2219.342,2220.301,You don't have meat?
2220.301,2221.26,We don't have meat in it.
2221.26,2222.47,No. You gotta be kidding me.
2222.47,2223.638,"Ew. Okay, no."
2223.638,2225.848,Just take some. Just take some.
2225.848,2227.85,Why is it pink? Mushy.
2227.85,2228.851,Are these cooked?
2228.851,2229.936,"It's a no for me, dog."
2229.936,2230.895,"Oh, this is a no."
2230.895,2231.729,Excuse me!
2231.729,2232.939,Your food is cold and soggy.
2232.939,2234.774,There was bacon in mine that I didn't order.
2234.774,2235.608,Cold and soggy.
2235.608,2236.442,Yes.
2236.442,2237.276,Sorry.
2237.276,2238.986,"No one's ever complained about extra bacon,"
2238.986,2240.321,which is kind of crazy.
2240.321,2241.656,"Well, I'm kind of allergic to bacon."
2241.656,2242.49,"No, you're not."
2242.49,2245.201,Excuse me. There was no meat in our burger.
2245.201,2246.035,There was no-
2246.035,2246.869,What are you talking about?
2246.869,2247.703,There was no burger
2247.703,2248.663,in our burger. There was no burger.
2248.663,2249.872,It was just buns. What are you talking about?
2249.872,2251.04,Where did the meat go?
2251.04,2251.874,No meat.
2251.874,2252.959,Where did the meat go?
2252.959,2253.918,And you know what?
2253.918,2255.127,When I find out who did this...
2255.127,2256.337,Okay.
2256.337,2259.048,I am livid for the both of you.
2264.929,2267.765,"Okay, it's not as soggy as the other one."
2267.765,2269.475,"Oh, it's actually quite warm on the bottom."
2269.475,2270.643,Mine's actually okay.
2270.643,2274.105,The onion jam is adding a lot of sweetness.
2274.105,2277.066,"Like, remember the other one we were missing the condiment?"
2277.066,2278.401,Burger's not half bad.
2278.401,2279.61,It's not shaped in a way
2279.61,2282.863,that anyone should ever shape a burger.
2283.823,2287.034,But it's much better than the last burger.
2287.034,2289.996,"It's not bad, but it's not seasoned."
2294.083,2295.418,Yep. Yep.
2295.418,2296.502,That's meat.
2296.502,2297.42,"Yeah, that's meat."
2297.42,2298.254,Okay.
2298.254,2299.213,This one's not bad.
2299.213,2300.047,You know?
2300.047,2301.257,There's a decent amount of syrup.
2301.257,2302.216,Not really any carbonation.
2302.216,2303.05,This burger-
2303.05,2304.135,It's nice and cold.
2304.135,2304.969,It is better.
2304.969,2306.304,It is cold. It has seasoning.
2306.304,2309.14,"The cream soda, it's still like watery but a lot better."
2309.14,2310.099,Look at that meat though.
2310.099,2312.435,"That's actually a good grilled meat, I think."
2312.435,2315.771,Maybe our bar has been lowered from the first experience.
2315.771,2317.106,Okay.
2317.106,2318.941,The votes are in.
2318.941,2323.112,It's time to find out who will escape the kitchen.
2324.905,2325.99,Oh.
2325.99,2328.075,"Oh, they're getting outta the car."
2328.075,2328.909,Whoo!
2328.909,2329.744,"Oh, they're coming to me."
2329.744,2331.454,Oh my god. What a good day.
2331.454,2333.122,I didn't even see you earlier.
2333.122,2333.998,Yeah. Yeah.
2333.998,2335.958,"Well, I'm so happy that you're both here on my birthday."
2335.958,2336.917,It's my birthday today.
2336.917,2337.752,I wanna get that out
2337.752,2338.711,"in front right now. Oh, okay."
2338.711,2339.67,It's your birthday. Got it. It's actually my birthday.
2339.67,2340.504,"Yeah, yeah."
2340.504,2341.464,"Gentlemen, how was your meal?"
2341.464,2342.673,"Oh, not great, man."
2342.673,2343.466,"Yeah, yeah."
2343.466,2344.3,Not great.
2344.3,2345.134,So the onion was good.
2345.134,2345.968,It was a little moist.
2345.968,2346.802,Moist.
2346.802,2347.636,Yeah. Very moist. Super moist.
2347.636,2348.721,"A few thoughts on the burgers,"
2348.721,2351.807,which I wouldn't have because my burger got-
2351.807,2352.641,Dropped.
2352.641,2353.476,Thrown out.
2353.476,2354.31,Dropped. Fell.
2354.31,2355.144,Yeah. Yeah.
2355.144,2356.604,"Yeah, I was a little distracted 'cause it's my birthday."
2356.604,2357.438,"Oh, okay."
2357.438,2359.523,I did get to taste Garrick's burger.
2359.523,2360.608,And it is a good burger.
2360.608,2362.318,Could've used a little more seasoning.
2362.318,2363.402,The soda was good though.
2363.402,2364.487,The soda was fantastic.
2364.487,2365.571,"We liked the soda. Oh, thank you."
2365.571,2366.53,"Yeah, that was really good."
2366.53,2367.365,"Oh, good."
2367.365,2368.199,Good for you.
2368.199,2369.033,I made that myself.
2369.033,2369.867,You did?
2369.867,2370.826,I bubbled it and I squirted it.
2370.826,2371.786,You bubbled it?
2371.786,2372.62,There was bubbles?
2372.62,2373.454,Yeah...
2373.454,2375.373,We were missing that.
2375.373,2377.458,"We rate the quality of food, which was great."
2377.458,2378.918,But we also rate service.
2378.918,2379.752,Right.
2379.752,2380.586,And you were mean to me.
2380.586,2382.421,We're gonna tally the votes from all the customers
2382.421,2384.882,on whether or not you escaped.
2384.882,2386.467,Did they escape? No.
2386.467,2387.426,Which car was that?
2387.426,2389.011,Did they escape?
2389.011,2389.845,Yes.
2390.846,2392.431,Come on.
2392.431,2393.265,Thank you.
2393.265,2394.1,Did they escape?
2394.1,2394.934,So that's hard no.
2394.934,2395.893,"That one said ""hard no."""
2395.893,2397.228,"This one said ""absolutely not."""
2397.228,2398.062,"Yeah, yeah."
2398.062,2399.146,That must have been from you.
2399.146,2399.98,Did they escape?
2399.98,2400.815,No.
2400.815,2402.024,No? That was you?
2402.024,2403.359,This one says no.
2403.359,2405.444,And I remember it's me 'cause I drew it in
2405.444,2407.53,just in case they didn't see the X
2407.53,2409.824,so that you knew I meant no.
2409.824,2411.659,"But, Ify, 'cause I remember all the things you said"
2411.659,2413.994,that you loved about it specifically.
2413.994,2414.829,Yeah.
2414.829,2415.663,Did they escape?
2415.663,2416.497,Yes.
2416.497,2417.331,Okay.
2417.331,2418.416,Did they escape?
2418.416,2419.75,Yes.
2419.75,2421.71,And then no and then no.
2421.71,2422.92,So no.
2422.92,2424.13,"No, you don't escape."
2424.13,2425.965,"Yeah, you stuck in the gulag."
2425.965,2427.55,"Yeah, get back in there."
2427.55,2428.384,Yeah.
2428.384,2429.677,So how many...
2431.053,2432.263,A couple yeses.
2432.263,2433.097,No.
2433.097,2435.307,No yeses unfortunately.
2435.307,2436.267,That's great.
2436.267,2439.228,"Yeah, that's a perfect score for nos."
2439.228,2440.438,So congratulations.
2440.438,2441.522,Oh my god. Thank you.

2447.987,2448.821,All right.

2527.399,2528.817,Look at this.
2528.817,2530.486,It seems like it’s an escape room.
2530.486,2531.153,No!
2531.153,2533.03,It’s really more of a torture chamber.
2533.03,2534.657,Are you strapping me in?
2535.366,2536.742,You really had breakdowns in there.
2536.742,2538.118,You know what we do with pirates?
