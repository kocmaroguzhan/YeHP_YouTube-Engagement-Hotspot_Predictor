173.36,175.509,wilbur no use the checkpoints you fall
175.519,176.949,i'm going on a hunch and i'm just gonna
176.959,179.11,go to minus six nine six nine
179.12,180.79,and then plus six nine six nine there
180.8,182.47,wasn't really anything
182.48,185.03,uh minus six thousand nine hundred or
185.04,186.949,six nine six nine wait hold up there's a
186.959,187.99,chest on some leaves
188.0,191.99,it says lol
192.0,193.75,someone just said try the year his
193.76,195.19,channel was made and my first thought
195.2,196.55,was no no one's that obsessed with
197.12,198.47,and then i went oh wait yeah let's look
198.48,200.229,at this channel
200.239,202.55,x-ray texture pack that'd be a great
202.56,204.39,idea however i feel like that would be
204.4,205.35,considered cheating
205.36,207.11,am i above that no i think what we
207.12,209.27,should do is uh get the chance to do it
209.28,211.43,for us so go on the seed everyone i've
211.44,212.789,shown the strength
212.799,214.71,i'm just running looking for desert
214.72,216.149,eventually so many chunks are being
216.159,217.91,loaded at the same time that the map
217.92,219.509,literally couldn't keep up with the lag
219.519,221.27,wait fellas is the server really laggy
221.28,222.949,what happened to this server the chunks
222.959,224.39,aren't loading how's anyone meant to get
224.4,226.869,anywhere if we just keep glitching back
226.879,230.949,stop let me craft i need to craft
230.959,235.35,we need help oh my gosh
235.36,237.27,that was not an unloaded challenge that
237.28,239.27,was an actual chunk that someone dug out
239.28,240.149,yes i
240.159,241.99,literally almost died so dream had to
242.0,243.589,reset the server
243.599,247.27,closed no no the sub just died no
247.28,249.19,after the server reset we realized that
249.2,250.789,people were getting much closer to the
250.799,251.509,gift cards
251.519,253.83,oh no i actually think those coordinates
253.84,255.27,i put in chat may be it because there's
255.28,255.99,a desert there
256.0,258.71,oh go go go go go then go what the
258.72,260.789,muffin where is the desert

288.8,291.03,is 69 420. it's 69 420
291.04,293.03,t he i've went this far just to be

308.88,310.95,okay so we know it's not 69 420 that's
310.96,312.07,in the middle of the ocean but it could
312.8,315.27,4 26 96 9. what do you think my next
315.28,316.55,hint should be maybe we could just
316.56,317.99,narrow it down and say it's and say it's
318.0,319.11,a positive positive
319.12,320.629,things were taking a little longer than
