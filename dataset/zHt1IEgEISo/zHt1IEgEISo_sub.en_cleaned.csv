1.4,2.95,Luke here with the arter boys YouTube
2.96,4.87,channel and I'm making a knife in the
4.88,6.789,middle of Alaska's Wilderness I'm going
6.799,8.31,to be sleeping in my own shelter
8.32,10.27,building a forge out in the woods making
10.28,12.669,my own charcoal kill and forging a knife
12.679,14.68,from scratch
39.64,41.11,it's been a couple weeks since I've been
41.12,45.549,here at the
45.559,47.869,shelter we got quite a bit of ice and
47.879,50.549,snow since I was here last and sealed up
50.559,52.91,the shelter really well well I think I
52.92,54.43,better bust out my shovel and start
54.44,83.95,digging things out
83.96,85.63,all right that looks pretty good I think
85.64,88.469,it's time to go find some kindling
88.479,90.63,though I'll tell you one nice thing
90.64,93.069,about this cold weather it made the snow
93.079,123.069,so hard you don't need snowshoes
123.079,124.429,well I want to get a roaring fire in
124.439,125.67,here pretty quick cuz I want to figure
125.68,127.069,out how much of this snow is going to
127.079,128.83,melt and I don't want to be underneath
128.84,130.869,here when that happens so whatever's
130.879,132.67,going to melt I want it to melt before
132.68,134.79,it gets dark tonight so that I can have
134.8,141.949,a nice dry bed to sleep
141.959,146.15,on oh my fire wood is so wet it rained
146.16,148.43,really good before it got cold I got to
148.44,150.55,prop it all up and get it to dry out
150.56,152.35,before I can use it all right we're
152.36,153.79,going to let that fire thaw out the
153.8,156.03,shelter get everything warmed up and I'm
156.04,157.91,really excited to build a forge out here
157.92,160.11,and do some blacksmithing projects
160.12,161.43,tomorrow but I'm going to need a lot of
161.44,163.19,charcoal so I'm going to build a
163.2,177.63,charcoal Kil and I need a lot of
177.64,179.47,wood think I'm going to go ahead and
179.48,183.229,start cooking some lunch I'm getting
183.239,185.949,hungry I got some frozen salami I want
185.959,189.309,to thaw out with that right there I got
189.319,231.39,some cheese wrapped in tin foil
231.4,233.75,oh that smells amazing I got a big slab
233.76,235.47,of soft cheese covered in a fig
235.48,237.35,marmalade just warmed it up over the
237.36,239.27,fire got it already pre-cut into a
239.28,243.47,little cubes got a nice Italian
243.48,246.429,salami there we go warm cheese little
246.439,263.83,salami some fig
263.84,265.83,sauce we're going to use this to make
265.84,300.23,our charcoal kill
358.6,360.39,we got the wood jam in there about as
360.4,379.99,tight as I
380.0,382.67,can there's a lot of snow and moisture
382.68,384.43,in these logs I'm going to try to get as
384.44,386.51,much of that moisture out before I put
386.52,388.589,the lid on you already start to see a
388.599,392.43,lot of steam coming out out of the
392.44,394.749,barrel you can hear the water sizzling
394.759,396.35,in the bottom of the barrel not going to
396.36,401.07,get any charcoal till all that water's
401.08,404.23,gone oh yeah that's really taking good a
404.24,406.55,lot of steam and a little bit of
406.56,409.15,smoke still feels pretty cool in the
409.16,410.67,middle though we're just going to let
410.68,412.67,that go for a nice long time I'm going
412.68,414.469,to be checking on this fire on and off
414.479,424.43,all night long
424.44,425.67,all right I think it's time to start
425.68,426.99,making this place
427.0,432.71,comfy put my animal hides in
432.72,435.23,there got a couple Caribou hides as a
435.24,439.589,mat a nice Buffalo hide as a
443.96,446.469,oh it's hard to see on the camera but
446.479,448.43,every now and then the smoke coming out
448.44,450.79,of the barrel is catching in on fire you
450.8,452.909,can hear the wood popping and stuff so I
452.919,453.909,think we're starting to get some
453.919,456.189,charcoal on the bottom but most of this
456.199,457.71,smoke coming out of here is actually
459.36,462.39,steam it feels
462.4,466.629,wet pieces like this are still
466.639,468.55,wet all right I'm going to go ahead and
468.56,479.55,cook a baked potato here
479.56,482.71,let's get this thing surrounded by
482.72,484.869,coals for dinner I thought I'd cook
484.879,486.95,myself a whole chicken I'm GNA go ahead
486.96,488.749,and spatch this bird which is
488.759,490.51,basically a way of preparing it so it
490.52,494.07,lays down flat makes it cook a lot
494.08,496.55,faster just cut either side of the spine
496.56,523.67,and take the whole spine out
523.68,526.11,some salt and
526.12,544.15,pepper let that roast
544.16,546.509,see how we got Flames coming out still a
546.519,551.069,lot of steam coming out but look at
551.079,554.55,that look at the Flames coming
554.56,557.35,out once I consistently see Flames
557.36,558.67,coming out of the barrel then I know
558.68,561.949,it's time to put the lid
561.959,564.509,on we just keep this fire going all
564.519,565.99,night and hopefully tomorrow we're going
566.0,570.67,to have a whole bunch of charcoal
570.68,571.949,all right we're going to go fill this up
571.959,573.91,a couple more times make sure I got
573.92,575.59,plenty of water for
575.6,577.949,tonight it's a long tradition that you
577.959,579.389,have to burn at least one thing when
579.399,581.829,winter camping and I think it was my
581.839,584.35,water bottle it's got like a goiter I
584.36,586.069,set it near the fire to keep it from
586.079,589.509,freezing and got it a little too close
589.519,591.43,yeah I better take care of that it's my
591.44,594.389,only water bottle on this trip now let's
594.399,597.35,see how the bird's
597.36,607.43,doing looking good
607.44,615.509,all right let's check on the
615.519,617.99,charcoal see the bottom of the lid is
618.0,621.269,covered in Wood
621.279,633.71,tar starting to come along
633.72,636.31,little jar of gravy here it's pretty
636.32,639.509,Frozen get that warmed up got some
644.639,647.71,oil got bacon chunks green onions yellow
647.72,649.71,onions and chives frying in a little
649.72,655.03,butter and
655.04,657.949,oil definitely overdid the baked potato
657.959,663.389,but that's okay
663.399,665.87,got butter salt pepper chives onions
665.88,668.35,bacon and a little bit of gravy on a
668.36,671.11,very overdone baked potato it's a little
671.12,672.79,charred on the outside but the inside's
672.8,674.829,still good all right let's take a look
674.839,675.949,at this
675.959,679.389,chicken oh that looks pretty
679.399,682.87,good oh you know it's done when you can
682.88,684.43,just pull the leg off and you don't have
684.44,686.949,to cut
686.959,689.509,it we're going to try some spicy H
689.519,691.31,barbecue sauce
691.32,695.15,too oh that is a good potato oh so hot
695.16,698.11,oh that gravy is just Tangy and
698.12,700.75,goodoo I like this spicy honey barbecue
700.76,702.949,sauce oh slow roasted chicken over a
702.959,711.55,fire is hard to
711.56,726.91,beat that was good
726.92,729.15,got a little dessert coming our
729.16,731.629,way this is a little Australian cookie
731.639,733.47,called a Tim tamam and if you bite the
735.279,738.11,off then you can use it as a
738.12,740.43,straw then all the hot chocolate melts
741.68,744.389,inside but that is a Tim tamam slam
745.16,747.629,there it's definitely feeling colder on
747.639,750.069,this trip put thermometer out in the
750.079,751.829,tree over there I'm going to go check it
751.839,754.189,see what it
754.199,756.91,says yeah it looks like it's about 3°
756.92,758.43,fight right now all right I'm going to
758.44,759.629,bring this inside the shelter we're
759.639,760.949,going to see how good of a job I did
760.959,763.069,building this
763.079,765.629,thing all right I'm going to go ahead
765.639,768.23,and just stick it right there on my bed
768.24,771.629,see we're almost 30° just a little below
771.639,773.99,freezing it's kind of fun look at all
774.0,776.59,the icicles it's
776.6,778.87,made all right I'm going to go grab some
778.88,781.43,wood real quick and uh I'm going to get
781.44,790.75,ready for
790.76,793.99,bed going to use my jacket and gloves as
794.0,797.71,a pillow oh I'm pretty tired I think
797.72,798.99,it's time to go to
799.0,802.509,bed see you guys in the
802.519,805.59,morning oh good morning oh I'm pretty
805.6,807.87,warm even though the fire's gone out but
807.88,809.829,my feet are a little bit cold
809.839,812.269,but I need to get
812.279,816.59,up my hide froze to the
816.6,829.269,logs there we
829.279,833.31,go oh that burned down pretty good can't
833.32,835.269,remember exactly but I think I built the
835.279,838.15,fire under that Barrel around 300 p.m.
838.16,841.55,and it's 8 : a.m. right now so 17 hours
841.56,843.31,it's been burning I think it's time we
843.32,845.269,crack it open and see what we got I
845.279,847.189,expect it's not completely done but
853.079,856.509,see W Barrel's much
856.519,863.71,lighter all
863.72,871.87,right look at that
871.88,875.509,that is great
875.519,877.79,charcoal there's some pieces that aren't
877.8,880.71,done all the way through this this will
880.72,883.71,work right it's so light you can just
883.72,887.35,feel the
887.36,889.67,difference you can see that some of it
889.68,894.15,down there is still
894.16,896.11,cooking well that seems to have worked
896.12,897.59,reasonably well we're going to let that
897.6,899.35,sit with the lid on while I go make some
899.36,901.15,breakfast hopefully it'll cool down a
901.16,906.629,little bit
906.639,908.629,more all right I'm going to be making a
908.639,910.79,tin foil breakfast it's hash brown
910.8,914.67,sausage bacon and
914.68,917.069,vegetables you can hear it sizzling
917.079,919.389,already let that sit and cook for about
919.399,955.389,an hour or so
969.24,971.069,that looks pretty good going to add some
971.079,982.949,of this spicy honey barbecue
982.959,991.71,sauce oh that was good
991.72,993.749,look at that it's 10:00 and it's all
1027.959,1030.069,got my Forge and my Anvil set up you
1030.079,1031.669,work the Billows by pumping the handle
1031.679,1033.789,up and down and that turns this flywheel
1033.799,1040.39,which runs a fan and blows air into the
1040.4,1042.87,coals unfortunately the grease on the
1042.88,1044.75,forage is frozen up so it doesn't want
1044.76,1046.429,to work very well right now so I'm going
1046.439,1048.27,to go ahead and get the fire going and I
1048.28,1068.87,think that'll solve my
1068.88,1071.39,problems so there's a little tooth right
1071.4,1073.43,here in this gear and when you spin the
1073.44,1075.95,hob the centrifugal force puts the tooth
1075.96,1078.99,out and it grips the inside of this gear
1079.0,1080.95,and engages the flywheel there's a lot
1080.96,1083.11,of grease in that Hub and that grease is
1083.12,1085.87,cold and so sometimes the tooth isn't
1085.88,1089.19,coming out and engaging
1089.2,1091.43,properly I think warming it up is
1091.44,1093.19,helping it work a little better but it's
1093.2,1100.31,still got
1100.32,1103.27,problems let's see if that
1103.28,1106.75,helps yeah that's working so I got a
1106.76,1108.789,piece of leaf spring steel from a broken
1108.799,1110.39,ATV trailer we're going to go ahead and
1110.4,1111.63,heat that up we're going to try to turn
1111.64,1116.43,it into a
1116.44,1142.43,knife all right
1142.44,1175.31,there you go
1175.32,1178.59,there we go I'm almost done using up all
1178.6,1180.789,the bad charcoal this stuff still works
1180.799,1201.31,pretty good
1201.32,1202.87,starting to get into some really good
1202.88,1216.99,charcoal here stuff is burning
1217.0,1219.23,great I was thinking how I want to
1219.24,1222.149,replace this with a metal
1222.159,1224.909,handle all right it'll still work just
1224.919,1228.99,going to be a lot more work
1262.159,1264.029,we'll let that cook for a couple hours
1264.039,1265.549,while I got the forge cleared out I'm
1265.559,1267.39,going to go ahead and empty it there's a
1267.4,1268.95,bunch of coals and Ash down there and
1268.96,1291.39,the fan won't turn
1321.72,1326.71,I need to sit down this is going to be a
1326.72,1328.909,while you know there's a common myth
1328.919,1330.669,amongst metal workers that files should
1330.679,1332.19,only be used in One
1332.2,1334.669,Direction turns out that's not true
1334.679,1336.59,works a whole lot better if you do it in
1336.6,1348.83,both directions
1348.84,1351.07,all of my structure caught
1351.08,1355.549,fire now we go deal with
1355.559,1357.95,that wouldn't be a winter camp out if I
1357.96,1359.63,didn't catch my structure on fire at
1359.64,1362.35,least once let's see how these moose
1362.36,1363.75,ribs are
1363.76,1365.59,doing if you want to know if they're
1365.6,1367.35,done you squeeze the end and if the
1367.36,1369.19,meat's pulled off the end of the bone
1369.2,1371.549,then you know they're done and this one
1376.76,1380.029,done is from the moose I shot this fall
1380.039,1388.789,oh I like moose
1388.799,1392.83,ribs oh that was good so messy though my
1392.84,1395.19,hands are so dirty the only clean spots
1395.2,1400.269,are where I was touching my
1400.279,1414.75,food I got to keep working on this knife
1422.96,1432.22,like the look of
1433.799,1437.19,that there you go one hole
1437.2,1440.789,drawn oh it's time for a little dessert
1440.799,1448.39,oh got a little mini pie nice and
1448.4,1458.35,warm oh that was good all right back to
1458.36,1464.149,work three
1464.159,1488.43,holes now it's time to harden it
1488.44,1490.789,who when you get high carbon steel
1490.799,1492.47,glowing hot and then cool it down
1492.48,1494.95,suddenly it becomes harder so after you
1494.96,1496.51,quench the knife in the snow you then
1496.52,1498.389,you test it with a file to see if it's
1498.399,1500.149,the right
1500.159,1502.59,hardness I like it I think it'll work
1502.6,1504.389,just fine well I'm at a good stopping
1504.399,1506.43,point for tonight and I am exhausted
1506.44,1508.31,it's really late so I'm going to hurry
1508.32,1511.19,up and get to

1595.96,1598.47,teabag could go for some ketchup or some
1598.48,1602.789,brown sauce right
1602.799,1605.269,now hopefully I thaw these and not
1605.279,1608.47,burned them little bit of both o a
1608.48,1611.31,caramel pecan cinnamon
1611.32,1613.51,roll burned it a little bit right there
1613.52,1616.19,but it's still
1616.2,1618.909,good oh that was good
1618.919,1622.149,all right I think it's time to get to
1622.159,1625.63,work woo this is cold the Tang's a
1625.64,1627.95,little bit wonkier than I would like so
1627.96,1631.07,I'm trying to improve it with the
1631.08,1633.149,file all right that's about as good as
1633.159,1635.11,I'm going to get with these tools now we
1635.12,1637.95,need some wood for the
1637.96,1644.51,handle there's a
1644.52,1660.669,contender there we go
1660.679,1662.389,I put some water on my wetstone and it
1662.399,1664.549,froze think I better warm up my wet
1664.559,1707.19,stone first
1707.2,1708.31,well it's almost noon I I think I'm
1708.32,1712.07,going to start making some
1712.08,1720.83,lunch look at all this lovely
1720.84,1723.07,charcoal it's nice having a big thing of
1723.08,1733.389,charcoal to cook
1733.399,1735.99,over for lunch I've got a Cornish pasty
1736.0,1737.43,that I'm going to bake in the coals it's
1737.44,1739.23,a handheld version of a meat pie from
1739.24,1759.71,the southwest of
1759.72,1762.509,England now we got to set the rivet this
1762.519,1764.509,is the sketchiest part these are just
1764.519,1767.389,Quin steel rods and they stick out just
1767.399,1769.549,a little bit further than the wood and
1769.559,1771.149,when you smash them with a hammer
1771.159,1773.07,they'll Mushroom on the end and that'll
1773.08,1775.149,squeeze the wood to the handle and make
1775.159,1778.149,everything set but if you smash the wood
1778.159,1784.909,instead of the metal you'll split the
1784.919,1786.909,wood there we
1788.679,1792.95,oh now we sand
1798.32,1803.509,it's looking pretty
1803.519,1807.47,good did reasonably well well I baked
1807.48,1810.269,pretty well except I missed a spot
1810.279,1812.149,Cornish pasties were a traditional meal
1812.159,1813.99,for the Cornish miners something they
1814.0,1815.83,could eat with Dirty Fingers I think
1815.84,1820.389,that's very applicable
1820.399,1825.71,today got beef carrot and parsnips it's
1825.72,1833.669,good oh that was really good
1833.679,1834.87,got a little bit of cooking oil I want
1834.88,1836.83,to rub into the handle to protect it but
1838.12,1840.73,frozen so we're going to boil some water
1851.519,1854.43,here this dead black Spruce is so dry
1854.44,1857.07,and porous it's just soaking up the oil
1857.08,1859.19,it's not a hand that should be clean
1859.2,1862.149,this is a handle that should have ash
1862.159,1876.79,and soot on
1883.48,1886.269,it well it's not exactly razor sharp but
1886.279,1898.38,I got an edge on it
1900.399,1903.11,oh my back I I'm going to take a little
1903.12,1904.789,break and make some dinner for dinner I
1904.799,1906.509,got some MSE stew that I vacuum sealed
1906.519,1908.389,and froze just going to throw it in a
1908.399,1910.31,pot of boiling water and it'll heat up
1910.32,1920.509,easy peasy now about this
1920.519,1930.95,first rivet in the sheath that's
1930.96,1932.83,good all right we're going to stretch
1932.84,1936.389,the leather out a little
1936.399,1952.11,bit there we go a knife and sheath
1952.12,1953.87,it's a sick little piece of equipment
1953.88,1956.07,there I like it oh looks like we're just
