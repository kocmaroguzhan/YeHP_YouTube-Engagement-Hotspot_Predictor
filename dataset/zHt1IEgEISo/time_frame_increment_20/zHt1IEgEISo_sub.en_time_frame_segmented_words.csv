0,20,Luke here with the arter boys YouTube channel and I 'm making a knife in the middle of Alaska 's Wilderness I 'm going to be sleeping in my own shelter building a forge out in the woods making my own charcoal kill and forging a knife from scratch
20,40,it 's been
40,60,a couple weeks since I 've been here at the shelter we got quite a bit of ice and snow since I was here last and sealed up the shelter really well well I think I better bust out my shovel and start
60,80,digging things out
80,100,all right that looks pretty good I think it 's time to go find some kindling though I 'll tell you one nice thing about this cold weather it made the snow so hard
100,120,you do n't need snowshoes
120,140,well I want to get a roaring fire in here pretty quick cuz I want to figure out how much of this snow is going to melt and I do n't want to be underneath here when that happens so whatever 's going to melt I want it to melt before it gets dark tonight so that I can have a nice dry bed to
140,160,sleep on oh my fire wood is so wet it rained really good before it got cold I got to prop it all up and get it to dry out before I can use it all right we 're going to let that fire thaw out the shelter get everything warmed up and I 'm really excited to build a forge out here and do some blacksmithing
160,180,projects tomorrow but I 'm going to need a lot of charcoal so I 'm going to build a charcoal Kil and I need a lot of wood think I 'm going to go ahead and
180,200,start cooking some lunch I 'm getting hungry I got some frozen salami I want to thaw out with that right there I got some
200,220,cheese wrapped in tin foil
220,240,oh that smells amazing I got a big slab of soft cheese covered in a fig marmalade just warmed it up over the fire got it already pre - cut into a
240,260,little cubes got a nice Italian salami there we go warm cheese little salami some
260,280,fig sauce we 're going to use this to make our
280,300,charcoal kill
340,360,we got the wood jam in there
360,380,about as tight as I
380,400,can there 's a lot of snow and moisture can there 's a lot of snow and moisture in these logs I 'm going to try to get as much of that moisture out before I put the lid on you already start to see a lot of steam coming out out of the barrel you can hear the water sizzling in the bottom of the barrel not going to get any charcoal till all
400,420,that water 's gone oh yeah that 's really taking good a lot of steam and a little bit of smoke still feels pretty cool in the middle though we 're just going to let that go for a nice long time I 'm going to be checking on this fire on and off all
420,440,night long all right I think it 's time to start making this place comfy put my animal hides in there got a couple Caribou hides as a mat a nice Buffalo hide as a
440,460,oh it 's hard to see on the camera but every now and then the smoke coming out of the barrel is catching in on fire you can hear the wood popping and stuff so I think we 're starting to get some charcoal on the bottom but most of this smoke coming out of here is actually
460,480,steam it feels wet pieces like this are still wet all right I 'm going to go ahead and cook a baked potato here let
480,500,'s get this thing surrounded by coals for dinner I thought I 'd cook myself a whole chicken I 'm GNA go ahead and spatch this bird which is basically a way of preparing it so it lays down flat makes it cook a lot faster just cut either side of the spine
500,520,and take the whole spine out
520,540,some salt and pepper let that
540,560,roast see how we got Flames coming out still a lot of steam coming out but look at that look at the Flames coming out once I consistently see Flames coming out of the barrel then I know it 's
560,580,time to put the lid on we just keep this fire going all night and hopefully tomorrow we 're going to have a whole bunch of charcoal all right we 're going to go fill this up a couple more times make sure I got plenty of water for tonight it 's a long tradition that you have to burn at least one thing when winter
580,600,camping and I think it was my water bottle it 's got like a goiter I set it near the fire to keep it from freezing and got it a little too close yeah I better take care of that it 's my only water bottle on this trip now let 's see how the bird 's
600,620,doing looking good all right let 's check on the charcoal see the bottom of the lid is covered
620,640,in Wood tar starting to come along little jar of gravy here it 's pretty Frozen get that warmed up got some
640,660,oil got bacon chunks green onions yellow onions and chives frying in a little butter and oil definitely overdid the baked potato but
660,680,that 's okay got butter salt pepper chives onions bacon and a little bit of gravy on a very overdone baked potato it 's a little charred on the outside but the inside 's still good all right let 's take a look at this chicken oh that looks pretty good
680,700,oh you know it 's done when you can just pull the leg off and you do n't have to cut it we 're going to try some spicy H barbecue sauce too oh that is a good potato oh so hot oh that gravy is just Tangy and goodoo I like this spicy
700,720,honey barbecue sauce oh slow roasted chicken over a fire is hard to beat that
720,740,was good got a little dessert coming our way this is a little Australian cookie called a Tim tamam and if you bite the off then you can use it as a straw then all the hot
740,760,chocolate melts inside but that is a Tim tamam slam there it 's definitely feeling colder on this trip put thermometer out in the tree over there I 'm going to go check it see what it says yeah it looks like it 's about 3 ° fight right now all right I 'm going to bring this inside the shelter we 're going to
760,780,see how good of a job I did building this thing all right I 'm going to go ahead and just stick it right there on my bed see we 're almost 30 ° just a little below freezing it 's kind of fun look at all the icicles it 's made all right I 'm going to go grab some wood real quick
780,800,and uh I 'm going to get ready for bed going to use my jacket and gloves as a pillow oh I 'm pretty tired I think it 's time to go to bed
800,820,see you guys in the morning oh good morning oh I 'm pretty warm even though the fire 's gone out but my feet are a little bit cold but I need to get up my hide froze to the
820,840,logs there we go oh that burned down pretty good ca n't remember exactly but I think I built the fire under that Barrel around 300 p.m. and it 's 8 : a.m.
840,860,right now so 17 hours it 's been burning I think it 's time we crack it open and see what we got I expect it 's not completely done but see W Barrel 's much
860,880,lighter all right look at that that is great charcoal there 's some pieces that are n't done all the way through this
880,900,this will work right it 's so light you can just feel the difference you can see that some of it down there is still cooking well that seems to have worked reasonably well we 're going to let that sit with the lid on while I go make some breakfast
900,920,hopefully it 'll cool down a little bit more all right I 'm going to be making a tin foil breakfast it 's hash brown sausage bacon and vegetables you can hear it sizzling already let that sit and cook for about
920,940,an hour or so
960,980,that looks pretty good going to add some of this spicy honey
980,1000,barbecue sauce oh that was good look at that it 's 10:00 and it 's all
1020,1040,got my Forge and my Anvil set up you work the Billows by pumping the handle up and down and that turns this flywheel which runs a fan and blows air into
1040,1060,the coals unfortunately the grease on the forage is frozen up so it does n't want to work very well right now so I 'm going to go ahead and get the fire going and I think that
1060,1080,'ll solve my problems so there 's a little tooth right here in this gear and when you spin the hob the centrifugal force puts the tooth out and it grips the inside of this gear and engages the
1080,1100,flywheel there 's a lot of grease in that Hub and that grease is cold and so sometimes the tooth is n't coming out and engaging properly I think warming it up is helping it work a little better but it 's still
1100,1120,got problems let 's see if that helps yeah that 's working so I got a piece of leaf spring steel from a broken ATV trailer we 're going to go ahead and heat that up we 're going to try to turn it into a
1120,1140,knife all right
1140,1160,there
1160,1180,you go there we go I 'm almost done using up all the bad charcoal this
1180,1200,stuff still works pretty
1200,1220,good starting to get into some really good charcoal here stuff is burning great I was thinking how I want to
1220,1240,replace this with a metal handle all right it 'll still work just going to be a lot more work
1260,1280,we 'll let that cook for a couple hours while I got the forge cleared out I 'm going to go ahead and empty it there 's a bunch of coals and Ash down there and the fan
1280,1300,wo n't turn
1320,1340,I need to sit down this is going to be a while you know there 's a common myth amongst metal workers that files should only be used in One Direction turns out that 's not true works a whole lot better if you do it in
1340,1360,both directions all of my structure caught fire now we go deal with that would n't be a winter camp out if I did n't catch my structure on fire at
1360,1380,least once let 's see how these moose ribs are doing if you want to know if they 're done you squeeze the end and if the meat 's pulled off the end of the bone then you know they 're done and this one done is from the moose I shot this
1380,1400,fall oh I like moose ribs oh that was good so messy though my hands are so dirty the only clean spots are where I was touching
1400,1420,my food I got to keep working on this knife
1420,1440,like the look of that there you go one hole drawn oh it 's time for a
1440,1460,little dessert oh got a little mini pie nice and warm oh that was good all right back to
1460,1480,work three holes now it 's time
1480,1500,to harden it who when you get high carbon steel glowing hot and then cool it down suddenly it becomes harder so after you quench the knife in the snow you then you test it with a file to see if it 's the
1500,1520,right hardness I like it I think it 'll work just fine well I 'm at a good stopping point for tonight and I am exhausted it 's really late so I 'm going to hurry up and get to bed oh my back I 'll see you in the morning we 're going to
1520,1540,finish this knife oh I 'm tired my arms are sore oh oh look how lazy I am it 's 8:40 in the morning and the sun 's up a the days are getting longer finally all right I got a lot to do today we
1540,1560,'re going to stoke up this fire and get going all right I got a couple cinnamon rolls I wrapped up in tin foil we 're going to go and warm those
1560,1580,suckers up got some very Frozen breakfast sausages poured the hot water in my plastic cup I can feel it crack and do all sorts of weird stuff hope you 're okay there cup you 're the only one I
1580,1600,got today I 'm hungry cold and thirsty and this is just hitting the spot it 's a spiced orange herbal tea good try to squeeze another round out of teabag could go for some ketchup or some brown
1600,1620,sauce right now hopefully I thaw these and not burned them little bit of both o a caramel pecan cinnamon roll burned it a little bit right there but it 's still good oh that was good all right I
1620,1640,think it 's time to get to work woo this is cold the Tang 's a little bit wonkier than I would like so I 'm trying to improve it with the file all right that 's about as good as I 'm going to get with these tools now we need some wood for the
1640,1660,handle there 's a contender there we
1660,1680,go I put some water on my wetstone and it froze think I better warm up my wet
1680,1700,stone first
1700,1720,well it 's almost noon I I think I 'm going to start making some lunch look at all this
1720,1740,lovely charcoal it 's nice having a big thing of charcoal to cook over for lunch I 've got a Cornish pasty that I 'm going to bake in the coals it 's a handheld version of a meat pie from
1740,1760,the southwest of
1760,1780,England now we got to set the rivet this is the sketchiest part these are just Quin steel rods and they stick out just a little bit further than the wood and when you smash them with a hammer they 'll Mushroom on the end and that 'll squeeze the wood to the handle and make everything set but if you smash the wood instead
1780,1800,of the metal you 'll split the wood there we oh now we sand it 's
1800,1820,looking pretty good did reasonably well well I baked pretty well except I missed a spot Cornish pasties were a traditional meal for the Cornish miners something they could eat with Dirty Fingers I think that 's very
1820,1840,applicable today got beef carrot and parsnips it 's good oh that was really good got a little bit of cooking oil I want to rub into the handle to protect it but frozen so we 're going to
1840,1860,boil some water here this dead black Spruce is so dry and porous it 's just soaking up the oil it 's not a hand that should be clean this is a
1860,1880,handle that should have ash and soot on
1880,1900,it well it 's not exactly razor sharp but I got an edge on it
1900,1920,oh my back I I 'm going to take a little break and make some dinner for dinner I got some MSE stew that I vacuum sealed and froze just going to throw it in a pot of boiling water and it 'll heat up easy peasy now about
1920,1940,this first rivet in the sheath that 's good all right we 're going to stretch the leather out a little bit
1940,1960,there we go a knife and sheath it 's a sick little piece of equipment there I like it oh looks like we 're just in time
1960,1980,too oh yeah moose stew is done oh that was good ah feels good to have some food in me but uh this project
1980,2000,worked out pretty well but you know what I 've been out here for 3 days and it 's time for me to go home but I 'm going to leave the forge out here definitely think I 'm going to back there I okay keep my Forge out of the
2000,2020,snow and ice all right we 're going to leave the charcoal here I 'm sure I 'll need that when I come back Anvil yeah it 'll be all right I think that 's it for this trip I 'll see you next video if you like that video make sure to check out
