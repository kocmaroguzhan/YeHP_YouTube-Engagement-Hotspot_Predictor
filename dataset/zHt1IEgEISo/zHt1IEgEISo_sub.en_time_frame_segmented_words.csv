0,5,Luke here with the arter boys YouTube channel and I 'm making a knife in the
5,10,middle of Alaska 's Wilderness I 'm going to be sleeping in my own shelter building a forge out in the woods
10,15,making my own charcoal kill and forging a knife from scratch
35,40,it 's been
40,45,a couple weeks since I 've been here at
45,50,the shelter we got quite a bit of ice and snow since I was here last and
50,55,sealed up the shelter really well well I think I better bust out my shovel and start
55,60,digging things out
80,85,all right that looks
85,90,pretty good I think it 's time to go find some kindling though I 'll tell you one
90,95,nice thing about this cold weather it made the snow
95,100,so hard you do n't need snowshoes
120,125,well I want to get a roaring fire in here pretty
125,130,quick cuz I want to figure out how much of this snow is going to melt and I do n't want to be underneath here when that
130,135,happens so whatever 's going to melt I want it to melt before it gets dark tonight so that I can have
135,140,a nice dry bed to sleep
140,145,on oh my fire wood is so wet
145,150,it rained really good before it got cold I got to prop it all up and get it
150,155,to dry out before I can use it all right we 're going to let that fire thaw out the shelter get
155,160,everything warmed up and I 'm really excited to build a forge out here and do some blacksmithing
160,165,projects tomorrow but I 'm going to need a lot of charcoal so I 'm going to build a
165,170,charcoal Kil and I need a lot of
175,180,wood think I 'm going to go ahead and
180,185,start cooking some lunch I 'm getting hungry I got some frozen
185,190,salami I want to thaw out with that right there I got
190,195,some cheese wrapped in tin foil
230,235,oh that smells amazing I got a big slab of soft cheese
235,240,covered in a fig marmalade just warmed it up over the fire got it already pre - cut into a
240,245,little cubes got a nice Italian salami there we go
245,250,warm cheese little
250,255,salami some fig
260,265,sauce we 're going to
265,270,use this to make
270,275,our charcoal kill
355,360,we got the wood jam in there
360,365,about as
365,370,tight as I
380,385,can there 's a lot of snow and moisture can there 's a lot of snow and moisture in these logs I 'm going to try to get as much of
385,390,that moisture out before I put the lid on you already start to see a lot of
390,395,steam coming out out of the barrel you can hear the water sizzling in
395,400,the bottom of the barrel not going to get any charcoal till all
400,405,that water 's gone oh yeah that 's really taking good a lot of
405,410,steam and a little bit of smoke still feels pretty cool in the middle though we 're
410,415,just going to let that go for a nice long time I 'm going to be checking on this fire on and off
415,420,all night long
420,425,all right I
425,430,think it 's time to start making this place comfy put my
430,435,animal hides in there got a couple Caribou hides
435,440,as a mat a nice Buffalo hide as a
440,445,oh it 's hard to
445,450,see on the camera but every now and then the smoke coming out of the barrel is catching
450,455,in on fire you can hear the wood popping and stuff so I think we 're starting to get some charcoal on the
455,460,bottom but most of this smoke coming out of here is actually
460,465,steam it feels wet pieces like
465,470,this are still wet all right I 'm going to go ahead and
470,475,cook a baked potato here
475,480,let
480,485,'s get this thing surrounded by coals for dinner I thought I 'd cook
485,490,myself a whole chicken I 'm GNA go ahead and spatch this bird which is basically a way of
490,495,preparing it so it lays down flat makes it cook a lot faster just
495,500,cut either side of the spine
500,505,and take the whole spine out
520,525,some
525,530,salt and
530,535,pepper let that roast
540,545,see how we got
545,550,Flames coming out still a lot of steam coming out
550,555,but look at that look at the Flames coming out
555,560,once I consistently see Flames coming out of the barrel then I know it 's
560,565,time to put the lid on we just keep this fire going all night and
565,570,hopefully tomorrow we 're going to have a whole bunch of
570,575,charcoal all right we 're going to go fill this up a couple more times make sure I got plenty of
575,580,water for tonight it 's a long tradition that you have to burn at least one thing when winter
580,585,camping and I think it was my water bottle it 's got like a goiter I set it near
585,590,the fire to keep it from freezing and got it a little too close yeah I
590,595,better take care of that it 's my only water bottle on this trip now let 's see
595,600,how the bird 's
600,605,doing looking good
605,610,all
610,615,right let 's check on the
615,620,charcoal see the bottom of the lid is covered
620,625,in Wood tar
625,630,starting to come along
630,635,little jar of
635,640,gravy here it 's pretty Frozen get that warmed up got some
640,645,oil
645,650,got bacon chunks green onions yellow onions and chives frying in a little
650,655,butter and
655,660,oil definitely overdid the baked potato but
660,665,that 's okay got butter salt pepper
665,670,chives onions bacon and a little bit of gravy on a very overdone baked
670,675,potato it 's a little charred on the outside but the inside 's still good all right let 's take a look
675,680,at this chicken oh that looks pretty good
680,685,oh you know it 's done when you can just pull the leg off and you do n't have
685,690,to cut it we 're going to try some spicy H
690,695,barbecue sauce too oh that is a good potato oh so
695,700,hot oh that gravy is just Tangy and goodoo I like this spicy
700,705,honey barbecue sauce oh slow roasted chicken over a
705,710,fire is hard to
715,720,beat that was good
725,730,got a little dessert coming our way this is a
730,735,little Australian cookie called a Tim tamam and if you bite the
735,740,off then you can use it as a straw then all the hot
740,745,chocolate melts inside but that is a Tim tamam slam
745,750,there it 's definitely feeling colder on this trip put thermometer out in
750,755,the tree over there I 'm going to go check it see what it says yeah
755,760,it looks like it 's about 3 ° fight right now all right I 'm going to bring this inside the shelter we 're going to
760,765,see how good of a job I did building this thing all right I 'm going
765,770,to go ahead and just stick it right there on my bed see we 're almost 30 °
770,775,just a little below freezing it 's kind of fun look at all the
775,780,icicles it 's made all right I 'm going to go grab some wood real quick
780,785,and uh I 'm going to get
785,790,ready for
790,795,bed going to use my jacket and gloves as a pillow
795,800,oh I 'm pretty tired I think it 's time to go to bed
800,805,see you guys in the morning oh good morning oh I 'm
805,810,pretty warm even though the fire 's gone out but my feet are a little bit cold
810,815,but I need to get up my hide
815,820,froze to the
820,825,logs there we
825,830,go oh
830,835,that burned down pretty good ca n't remember exactly but I think I
835,840,built the fire under that Barrel around 300 p.m. and it 's 8 : a.m.
840,845,right now so 17 hours it 's been burning I think it 's time we crack it open and see what we
845,850,got I expect it 's not completely done but
850,855,see W
855,860,Barrel 's much
860,865,lighter all
865,870,right look at that
870,875,that is
875,880,great charcoal there 's some pieces that are n't done all the way through this
880,885,this will work right it 's so light you can just
885,890,feel the difference you can see that some of it
890,895,down there is still cooking well
895,900,that seems to have worked reasonably well we 're going to let that sit with the lid on while I go make some breakfast
900,905,hopefully it 'll cool down a little
905,910,bit more all right I 'm going to be making a tin foil breakfast it
910,915,'s hash brown sausage bacon and
915,920,vegetables you can hear it sizzling already let that sit and cook for about
920,925,an hour or so
965,970,that looks
970,975,pretty good going to add some of this
975,980,spicy honey barbecue
985,990,sauce oh that was good
990,995,look at that it 's 10:00 and it 's all
1025,1030,got my Forge and my Anvil set up
1030,1035,you work the Billows by pumping the handle up and down and that turns this flywheel which
1035,1040,runs a fan and blows air into the
1040,1045,coals unfortunately the grease on the forage is frozen up so it does n't want to
1045,1050,work very well right now so I 'm going to go ahead and get the fire going and I
1050,1055,think that 'll solve my
1065,1070,problems so there
1070,1075,'s a little tooth right here in this gear and when you spin the hob the centrifugal
1075,1080,force puts the tooth out and it grips the inside of this gear and engages the
1080,1085,flywheel there 's a lot of grease in that Hub and that grease is cold and so sometimes the
1085,1090,tooth is n't coming out and engaging properly I
1090,1095,think warming it up is helping it work a little better but it 's
1095,1100,still got
1100,1105,problems let 's see if that helps yeah that
1105,1110,'s working so I got a piece of leaf spring steel from a broken ATV trailer we 're going to go
1110,1115,ahead and heat that up we 're going to try to turn it
1115,1120,into a
1120,1125,knife all right
1145,1150,there you go
1175,1180,there we go I 'm almost done using up all the bad charcoal this
1180,1185,stuff still works
1185,1190,pretty good
1200,1205,starting to get into some really good
1205,1210,charcoal here stuff is burning
1215,1220,great I was thinking how I want to
1220,1225,replace this with a metal handle all right it 'll still work just
1225,1230,going to be a lot more work
1260,1265,we 'll let that cook for a couple hours while I got the forge
1265,1270,cleared out I 'm going to go ahead and empty it there 's a bunch of coals and Ash down there and
1270,1275,the fan wo n't turn
1320,1325,I need to sit down this
1325,1330,is going to be a while you know there 's a common myth amongst metal workers
1330,1335,that files should only be used in One Direction turns out that 's not true works
1335,1340,a whole lot better if you do it in
1340,1345,both directions
1345,1350,all of my
1350,1355,structure caught fire now we go deal
1355,1360,with that would n't be a winter camp out if I did n't catch my structure on fire at
1360,1365,least once let 's see how these moose ribs are doing if you want to
1365,1370,know if they 're done you squeeze the end and if the meat 's pulled off the end of the bone then you
1370,1375,know they 're done and this one
1375,1380,done is from the moose I shot this
1380,1385,fall oh I
1385,1390,like moose ribs oh
1390,1395,that was good so messy though my hands are so dirty the only clean
1395,1400,spots are where I was touching
1400,1405,my food I got to
1405,1410,keep working on this knife
1425,1430,like the look of
1430,1435,that
1435,1440,there you go one hole drawn oh it 's time for a
1440,1445,little dessert oh got a little
1445,1450,mini pie nice and warm
1450,1455,oh that was good all right back to
1460,1465,work three
1465,1470,holes now it 's time to harden it
1485,1490,who when you get high
1490,1495,carbon steel glowing hot and then cool it down suddenly it becomes harder so after you
1495,1500,quench the knife in the snow you then you test it with a file to see if it 's the
1500,1505,right hardness I like it I think it 'll work just fine well I 'm at a good stopping point for
1505,1510,tonight and I am exhausted it 's really late so I 'm going to hurry up and
1510,1515,get to bed oh my back I
1515,1520,'ll see you in the morning we 're going to
1520,1525,finish this knife oh I
1525,1530,'m tired my arms are sore
1530,1535,oh oh look how lazy I am it 's 8:40 in the morning and
1535,1540,the sun 's up a the days are getting longer finally all right I got a lot to do today we
1540,1545,'re going to stoke up this fire and get
1545,1550,going all
1550,1555,right I got a couple cinnamon rolls I wrapped up in tin foil we 're going to go and warm
1555,1560,those
1560,1565,suckers up got some very Frozen breakfast
1570,1575,sausages poured the hot water in my plastic cup I can feel it
1575,1580,crack and do all sorts of weird stuff hope you 're okay there cup you 're the only one I
1580,1585,got today I 'm hungry cold and thirsty and this is just hitting the spot it 's a
1585,1590,spiced orange herbal tea good
1590,1595,try to squeeze another round out of
1595,1600,teabag could go for some ketchup or some brown
1600,1605,sauce right now hopefully I thaw these
1605,1610,and not burned them little bit of both o a caramel
1610,1615,pecan cinnamon roll burned it a little bit right there but it
1615,1620,'s still good oh that was good all right I
1620,1625,think it 's time to get to work woo this is cold the
1625,1630,Tang 's a little bit wonkier than I would like so I 'm trying to
1630,1635,improve it with the file all right that 's about as good as I 'm going to get with these tools now
1635,1640,we need some wood for the
1640,1645,handle there 's a
1645,1650,contender there we go
1660,1665,I put some water on my wetstone and it froze think I better warm up my wet
1665,1670,stone first
1705,1710,well it 's almost noon I I think I 'm going to
1710,1715,start making some lunch
1715,1720,look at all this lovely
1720,1725,charcoal it 's nice having a big thing of
1725,1730,charcoal to cook
1730,1735,over for lunch I 've got
1735,1740,a Cornish pasty that I 'm going to bake in the coals it 's a handheld version of a meat pie from
1740,1745,the southwest of
1760,1765,England now we got to set the rivet this is the sketchiest part these are just Quin
1765,1770,steel rods and they stick out just a little bit further than the wood and when you
1770,1775,smash them with a hammer they 'll Mushroom on the end and that 'll squeeze the wood to the handle and
1775,1780,make everything set but if you smash the wood instead
1780,1785,of the metal you 'll split the
1785,1790,wood there we oh
1790,1795,now we sand
1795,1800,it 's
1800,1805,looking pretty good did
1805,1810,reasonably well well I baked pretty well except I missed a
1810,1815,spot Cornish pasties were a traditional meal for the Cornish miners something they could eat with
1815,1820,Dirty Fingers I think that 's very
1820,1825,applicable today got beef carrot and
1825,1830,parsnips it 's good oh that
1830,1835,was really good got a little bit of cooking oil I want
1835,1840,to rub into the handle to protect it but frozen so we 're going to
1840,1845,boil some water
1850,1855,here this dead black Spruce is so dry and
1855,1860,porous it 's just soaking up the oil it 's not a hand that should be clean this is a
1860,1865,handle that should have ash
1865,1870,and soot on
1880,1885,it well it 's not
1885,1890,exactly razor sharp but I got
1890,1895,an edge on it
1900,1905,oh my back I I 'm going to take a little break and make some dinner for dinner I got
1905,1910,some MSE stew that I vacuum sealed and froze just going to throw it in a pot of boiling water and it 'll
1910,1915,heat up easy peasy
1915,1920,now about this
1920,1925,first rivet
1925,1930,in the sheath that 's
1930,1935,good all right we 're going to stretch the leather
1935,1940,out a little bit
1940,1945,there we go a knife and sheath
1950,1955,it 's a sick little piece of equipment there I like it oh
1955,1960,looks like we 're just in time
1960,1965,too oh yeah moose stew is
1970,1975,done oh
1975,1980,that was good ah feels good to have some food in me but uh this project
1980,1985,worked out pretty well but you know what I 've been out here for 3 days and it 's time for me
1985,1990,to go home but I 'm going to leave the forge out here definitely think I 'm going to
1995,2000,back there I okay keep my Forge out of the
2000,2005,snow and ice all right we 're going to leave the charcoal here I 'm sure I 'll need that when I
2005,2010,come back Anvil yeah it 'll be all right I think that 's it for this
