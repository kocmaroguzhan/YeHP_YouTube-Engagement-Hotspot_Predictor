start_time,end_time,words
0,5,I 'm about to enter a part of Tokyo that is hidden from society the one and only slum
5,10,called Sonna Tokyo skid R is a place where tourists never visit this small
10,15,neighborhood has been wiped off Japanese Maps because the government does n't want you to know that poverty exists
15,20,here insia Outcast loiter with cheap beer while hostiles advertise rooms at Rock Bottom
20,25,rates I want to see what a slum looks like in one of the world 's richest cities because it 's not all fancy
25,30,restaurants and high - tech gadgets I have three goals while filming in Sonia one to hang out with as many local
30,35,residents as I can two to try to document the living conditions inside someone 's home that 's where
35,40,you sleep and three to meet up with a member of the Yakuza the notorious Japanese gang who run these
40,45,streets can I see your oh to do all of this I 'm
45,50,meeting up with my local friend Kos who will help me navigate the winding alleys that
50,55,separate this slum from the rest of Tokyo the taxi just
55,60,dropped us off I think we 're nearby the vibe here is like a post World War II classic Japan
60,65,ches Town away from all the shiny buildings and neon lights just walking on the street here
65,70,there 's just trash everywhere just piles of trash look at this it already feels different
70,75,down here than other parts of Tokyo I have n't seen a single Foreigner yet in this whole area and we 're
75,80,in peak season right now cherry blossom season so there 's foreigners all over Tokyo maybe I can
80,85,book your hotel here no please no please no we ca n't really find it so we
85,90,'re just asking around like on the other side of
90,95,the Street yeah somewhere in this direction we
95,100,'ve been told I it is
100,105,impossible to find this place unless you know where you 're going that 's
105,110,because in 1966 the Japanese government ordered the name Sonia to be removed from all official
110,115,records it was an attempt to camouflage its association with poverty alcoholism and
115,120,violence feels a little different right yeah yeah yeah different that 's
120,125,normal it 's normal there 's a lot of hotels here and when you look at the
125,130,"prices it 's 2,000 Yen a night which is about $ 10 anywhere else in Tokyo you ca n't find a"
130,135,room for under like 70
135,140,bucks a night yeah see there 's homeless guys already hi
140,145,Hi how are American
145,150,what is a typical day in the life of people living here not that Christmas the people
150,155,living here like they escape from Yakuza oh yeah yeah yeah and they were supported by
155,160,government are there any Yakuza people here many many there
160,165,'s Yak office really what are some of the crazier things that you 've seen
165,170,living here he saw many people die here he tried
170,175,to get suicide oh he took 50 medicine why did you try
175,180,to commit suicide uh he get tired over the life is it dangerous here
180,185,should go oh long long time ago really but they they killed other
185,190,witnessing riots in Sonia are not common these days but they were an essential part of the slums
190,195,history after the second world war small tent Villages were set up in this neighborhood for people who are
195,200,made homeless by us bombings as these Villages turned into cheap hostiles Sonia became
200,205,populated with bluecollar workers in search of jobs and shelter these are the very men who
205,210,rebuilt modern Japan the Tokyo Tower facilities for the 1964 Olympics as well as as
210,215,key roads and highways but now they 've been forgotten and are left alone to survive on small
215,220,pensions while drinking beer and playing board games to pass time I surprised that
220,225,there is a slum in Tokyo ah many trash there after walking around for a few
225,230,blocks we stumble upon a park which we are told is a center of activity in the slum there 's a lot of
230,235,elderly men here everyone has a beer in their hand and they 're all just playing games it 's 128 and they 're all
235,240,just drinking beer are you is this your sleep

650,655,dorm room scraps of food on the counter wet clothes hanging from the ceiling and people packed together
655,660,like sardines there 's not much else to explore in here and I 'm finding out that these people are not actually his

665,670,sleeping here he 's sleeping here that 's where you sleep wow
670,675,this entire situation is wild you have to go to the top of the
675,680,complex in these tiny little staircase and this is where he lives I 'm like so shocked to

685,690,okay wow how long have you been living
690,695,50 years in the same spot oh yeah yes yes really have you ever

750,755,no no kids no kids no kids would you say that you 're happy or sad
755,760,right now no happiness no sad just just get used it this feeling you lived in
760,765,Tokyo for a long time what are your thoughts about this situation I never seen kind of this place never talk
765,770,with kind of people so I just got shocked yeah what does a day in your life look like from

780,785,come back we have hey what do

790,795,free there 's so many things like here like scissors and clothes and Chopsticks and has
795,800,anybody ever visited your home before never never so how do you
800,805,feel that we 're here it 's kind of
805,810,like welcome
810,815,welcome w that 's oh that was crazy bro yeah
815,820,yeah yeah I 'm shocked by the contrast between Tokyo and this slum though I believe it 's important
820,825,to highlight the Dignity of those often overlooked but now it 's time to take things a step
825,830,further behind the scenes I 've been reaching out to all my Japanese contacts hoping to connect with a real Yakuza
830,835,after many failed attempts and potential scams I finally got in touch with one guy who will open up
835,840,to my camera but he lives in the southern part of the country Kos and I are catching a last flight right now
840,845,to meet him and learn about the wild world of Japan 's
845,850,most dangerous gang all right we just arrived on the outskirts of
850,855,Fukuoka to meet up with a real life Yakuza it 's a little spooky that we 're meeting him at night he
855,860,prefers to meet in the evening so we 've showed up at a random parking lot and just waiting for him to
860,865,arrive are you yeah that 's why my mind is
865,870,think the gangster 's name is yuyama and before I start filming he makes me agree to keep
870,875,things low - key so we do n't draw unnecessary attention all I know at this moment is that he grew up with the wrong
875,880,crowd in Fukuoka fighting and getting into trouble with cops from a young age when you were young did you
880,885,know that you wanted to become a Yakuza he
885,890,hated yaka when he was kid he had some problem his heart his back
890,895,so he he needs money he went to like job hunting that job wasak job
895,900,can I see your finger
900,905,he said he must to try to cut and I
905,910,said no yubitsume is a strict practice that represents loyalty when a Yakuza member fails their
910,915,Duty they may be required to cut off a portion of their own finger to make up for their mistake this ritual days
915,920,back centuries and it 's a form of psychological manipulation did you cut it off yourself or
920,925,someone did it for you he cut himself yeah he did n't feel pain and now he
925,930,'s proud of that now that we 're friends we 're heading downtown to link up with you young 's buddy
930,935,another gang member pretty crazy man we 're just following him now in his sketchy car look at
935,940,his license plate what the is that
940,945,what is that the city 's pretty Lively like there 's a lot
945,950,going on in this downtown area it 's actually crazy if you look at the map Fukuoka is the closest Big
950,955,City to Busan in South Korea we 're just right across the sea bro this City 's cool man
955,960,yeah you 've been here a lot right yes a lot my father 's your father 's from here all right we found
960,965,our boys we are rolling around Fukuoka you know what 's crazy is
965,970,that when we walk on the streets nobody knows that these are Yakuza in the US like
970,975,gangs they 're heavily involved in drugs do Yakuza people do
975,980,drugs yeah most most like do drugs what are the most
980,985,common drugs that they take like
985,990,heroine they do business also they sell heroins if somebody wants to become a
990,995,Yakuza what do they have to do they joined the B of group
995,1000,like young people were like bad the Yakuza people see their life they
1000,1005,could join what he 's saying is that you have to walk the lifestyle to be admitted into the gang Boku for
1005,1010,example is a rebellious biker gang associated with Japanese youth many kids start out in the
1010,1015,subculture before evolving into Yakuza members once you become a Yakuza if you want to leave
1015,1020,how can you leave or do you do you just say like okay I 'm done or do you have to like do
1020,1025,something serious to leave they like give a lot
1025,1030,of money or they cut their finger or the crew
1030,1035,hit hit a guy or something so there are many ways of quit how do you get like a
1035,1040,higher ranking like to go up to like the boss so
1040,1045,like one is the people who do business well and the
1045,1050,young people go to prison instead of him got it yeah do people
1050,1055,have guns here yeah hide hide they hide did you did you
1055,1060,have one ah no he he quits so he does n't have gun before
1060,1065,before he has yeah do you miss it do you feel like you want to
1065,1070,go back it was really fun they miss sometimes but they do n't want to go back
1070,1075,because they do n't have any benefits why are you so open to sharing this
1075,1080,information most yakas they want to cover their face why is it okay for
1080,1085,you they they have no regets and they have proud of become Yak so that 's
1085,1090,why they do n't need to hide so that 's why they want to
1090,1095,share also
1095,1100,these guys have been super cool down to earth and it 's just surreal to walk around
1100,1105,these like clean beautiful streets of Fukuoka and here about their crazy stories of chopping off fingers and
1105,1110,breaking bones and killing people it 's absolutely bizarre have you seen any Yakuza
1110,1115,people walking you did that guy really do you give
1115,1120,him like a wink like that 's so crazy it 's like an
1120,1125,undercover Society in my opinion Japan is the most respectful culture in the world so
1125,1130,why do Yakuza like steal and kill people
1130,1135,like why in Japan people with reason if
1135,1140,they afraid the enemy killed their friends or their family they have to
1140,1145,kill first to destroy their company or like they protect their families
1145,1150,their friends what does the future look like for the Yakuza like is it growing or is
1150,1155,it shrinking Yakuza never gone because like if the Yakuza leave the
1155,1160,Chinese Mafia is coming and they like the the balance like Chinese
1160,1165,Mafia do n't come because there Japanese Mafia you know the yak for me it 's like
1165,1170,movie I only know them in the movie so I 'm really interested to hear their
1170,1175,experience although they are portrayed in movies as stylish Mobsters that 's only one part of
1175,1180,the real story beyond their criminal activities the Yakuza sometimes provide order where the government
1180,1185,falls short their involvement in relief efforts during natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis have
1185,1190,earned them reluctant respect from the public but their methods have led to widespread fear because they often
1190,1195,involve threats and violence today government crackdowns isolate the Yakuza from mainstream society
1195,1200,which explains why our friends are so hesitant to speak openly heading into restaurant
1200,1205,here everything about Japan is cool like the moment you walk into a restaurant you just feel happy
1205,1210,hello hello hello hello how are you it 's risky to talk about the Yakuza in public so we choose the room
1210,1215,upstairs to keep our voices down they keep looking around to see who 's watching because they do n't want to reveal anything
1215,1220,that could get them in trouble when I think of the word Yakuza I think of it being really
1220,1225,dangerous people killing each other guns is it really that dangerous yeah it 's true
1225,1230,it 's true after he joined the Yakuza like 3 months later his boss was
1230,1235,killed what 's the scariest like story that you could
1235,1240,tell me his boss was really crazy and his boss told him to
1240,1245,break a girl like he thought he does n't want to do but his boss was
1245,1250,crazy and he has to follow do you feel bad about it now
1250,1255,right did you go to college no he never graduate
1255,1260,high school too really in general how does money work do you have
1260,1265,jobs in Yakuza how do people make money
1265,1270,sex industry and also the yak people like lend money and
1270,1275,they take more yeah take more if they poor they P
1275,1280,together if they reach they reach together they always care about the
1280,1285,their Crews and if their business goes well many beautiful woman comes and they
1285,1290,work hard because they got a lot of money how long would were you a Yakuza
1290,1295,for years old what was the best and the worst part about being
1295,1300,Yakuza the the Yakuza fights it 's like
1300,1305,conflict the people have to kill somebody yeah yeah so that was the best part he
1305,1310,said yeah when he won he felt happy and it was best moment what 's the
1310,1315,moment
1315,1320,police him how many times have you been in
1320,1325,he was in the prison only once when he was like
1325,1330,younger like high school he also was CED and he he was in
1330,1335,prison like in total 10 years what what what did you get caught
1335,1340,for he he hit his
1340,1345,like the stuff uh yeah with the hmer on the head
1345,1350,but he did n't die
1350,1355,oh that 's awesome is that a requirement like in order to be a KU you have to
1355,1360,tattoos it depends on the yaka like if
1360,1365,the yaka Community has much money they can pay for them to make
1365,1370,tattoo but if they do n't have much money they do n't tattoos in Japan are historically
1370,1375,associated with criminal organizations like the Yakuza members decorate their bodies in elaborate
1375,1380,tattoos as a symbol of status and because of this tattoos are very Bo in Japan while
1380,1385,attitudes towards body art are changing you wo n't see a lot of them while walking the streets all right belly 's full
1385,1390,and we are following the Yakuza to some NTI spots here my first time in the city so
1390,1395,I 'm pumped do n't gabana I can not believe their
1395,1400,stories and it 's really interesting to it 's crazy bro yeah it 's really crazy it 's
1400,1405,really crazy but I 'm still scared of that over them because my stereotypes of
1405,1410,yaka is really dangerous and easy to get mad and get
1410,1415,angry and fight and vient and me do n't piss him off yeah yes yes yes so that
1415,1420,'s why I 'm really take care of my speaking Japanese to them I
1420,1425,need to use respect way I hope we
1425,1430,do n't die our friends lead us to an underground bar in Fukuoka it is no
1430,1435,accident that the Yakuza hang out and accident that the Yakuza hang out and hole in- the wall spots like this one here in hushed conversations
1435,1440,deals are made and alliances are forged it 's cold
1440,1445,outside man man hot
1445,1450,towels
1450,1455,cheers
1455,1460,strong what do you think
1460,1465,about his life his life is really complicated so there 's nothing
1465,1470,to say about him do you support his
1470,1475,decisions to join your
1475,1480,no she just say like it 's complicated but
1480,1485,it 's it 's okay because his life yeah do the accusers like
1485,1490,run all the bars in Tokyo like they run the nlife areas
1490,1495,yeah yeah yeah there are lot of bars what happens if
1495,1500,a tourist like me goes into a bar and makes a problem with your what what
1500,1505,happened like they will kill me if like you you were
1505,1510,drunk and you you know they show something they they trying to stop you

1545,1550,them it 's it 's not easy to change your life but
1550,1555,you can do it be happy everyone and do n't never
1555,1560,give up what a wild 24 hours it 's been in Japan from exploring Tokyo 's only slum and meeting
1560,1565,its residents who have seemingly been forgotten about to uncovering the secretive world of Yakuza life and
1565,1570,learning about their staggering influence on Japanese Society I 've now experienced a darker side of this
1570,1575,country that is hard to believe is true listen I know all you guys out there have an obsession with Japan
