0,20,I 'm about to enter a part of Tokyo that is hidden from society the one and only slum called Sonna Tokyo skid R is a place where tourists never visit this small neighborhood has been wiped off Japanese Maps because the government does n't want you to know that poverty exists here insia Outcast loiter with cheap beer while hostiles advertise rooms at Rock Bottom
20,40,rates I want to see what a slum looks like in one of the world 's richest cities because it 's not all fancy restaurants and high - tech gadgets I have three goals while filming in Sonia one to hang out with as many local residents as I can two to try to document the living conditions inside someone 's home that 's where you sleep and three to meet up with a member of the Yakuza the notorious Japanese gang who run these
40,60,streets can I see your oh to do all of this I 'm meeting up with my local friend Kos who will help me navigate the winding alleys that separate this slum from the rest of Tokyo the taxi just dropped us off I think we 're nearby the vibe here is like a post World War II classic Japan
60,80,ches Town away from all the shiny buildings and neon lights just walking on the street here there 's just trash everywhere just piles of trash look at this it already feels different down here than other parts of Tokyo I have n't seen a single Foreigner yet in this whole area and we 're in peak season right now cherry blossom season so there 's foreigners all over Tokyo maybe I can
80,100,book your hotel here no please no please no we ca n't really find it so we 're just asking around like on the other side of the Street yeah somewhere in this direction we 've been told I it is
100,120,impossible to find this place unless you know where you 're going that 's because in 1966 the Japanese government ordered the name Sonia to be removed from all official records it was an attempt to camouflage its association with poverty alcoholism and violence feels a little different right yeah yeah yeah different that 's
120,140,"normal it 's normal there 's a lot of hotels here and when you look at the prices it 's 2,000 Yen a night which is about $ 10 anywhere else in Tokyo you ca n't find a room for under like 70 bucks a night yeah see there 's homeless guys already hi"

180,200,should go oh long long time ago really but they they killed other witnessing riots in Sonia are not common these days but they were an essential part of the slums history after the second world war small tent Villages were set up in this neighborhood for people who are made homeless by us bombings as these Villages turned into cheap hostiles Sonia became
200,220,populated with bluecollar workers in search of jobs and shelter these are the very men who rebuilt modern Japan the Tokyo Tower facilities for the 1964 Olympics as well as as key roads and highways but now they 've been forgotten and are left alone to survive on small pensions while drinking beer and playing board games to pass time I surprised that
220,240,there is a slum in Tokyo ah many trash there after walking around for a few blocks we stumble upon a park which we are told is a center of activity in the slum there 's a lot of elderly men here everyone has a beer in their hand and they 're all just playing games it 's 128 and they 're all just drinking beer are you is this your sleep

660,680,roommates I 'm being led upstairs to see something even more bizarre here he 's sleeping here he 's sleeping here that 's where you sleep wow this entire situation is wild you have to go to the top of the complex in these tiny little staircase and this is where he lives I 'm like so shocked to

760,780,Tokyo for a long time what are your thoughts about this situation I never seen kind of this place never talk with kind of people so I just got shocked yeah what does a day in your life look like from morning to evening H taking a walk and he play with like kind of you know the board game and drinking beer yeah and go to stand and
780,800,come back we have hey what do you do about food volunteer groups give him the food for free there 's so many things like here like scissors and clothes and Chopsticks and has anybody ever visited your home before never never so how do you
800,820,feel that we 're here it 's kind of like welcome welcome w that 's oh that was crazy bro yeah yeah yeah I 'm shocked by the contrast between Tokyo and this slum though I believe it 's important
820,840,to highlight the Dignity of those often overlooked but now it 's time to take things a step further behind the scenes I 've been reaching out to all my Japanese contacts hoping to connect with a real Yakuza after many failed attempts and potential scams I finally got in touch with one guy who will open up to my camera but he lives in the southern part of the country Kos and I are catching a last flight right now
840,860,to meet him and learn about the wild world of Japan 's most dangerous gang all right we just arrived on the outskirts of Fukuoka to meet up with a real life Yakuza it 's a little spooky that we 're meeting him at night he prefers to meet in the evening so we 've showed up at a random parking lot and just waiting for him to
860,880,arrive are you yeah that 's why my mind is think the gangster 's name is yuyama and before I start filming he makes me agree to keep things low - key so we do n't draw unnecessary attention all I know at this moment is that he grew up with the wrong crowd in Fukuoka fighting and getting into trouble with cops from a young age when you were young did you
880,900,know that you wanted to become a Yakuza he hated yaka when he was kid he had some problem his heart his back so he he needs money he went to like job hunting that job wasak job can I see your finger
900,920,he said he must to try to cut and I said no yubitsume is a strict practice that represents loyalty when a Yakuza member fails their Duty they may be required to cut off a portion of their own finger to make up for their mistake this ritual days back centuries and it 's a form of psychological manipulation did you cut it off yourself or
920,940,someone did it for you he cut himself yeah he did n't feel pain and now he 's proud of that now that we 're friends we 're heading downtown to link up with you young 's buddy another gang member pretty crazy man we 're just following him now in his sketchy car look at his license plate what the is that
940,960,what is that the city 's pretty Lively like there 's a lot going on in this downtown area it 's actually crazy if you look at the map Fukuoka is the closest Big City to Busan in South Korea we 're just right across the sea bro this City 's cool man yeah you 've been here a lot right yes a lot my father 's your father 's from here all right we found
960,980,our boys we are rolling around Fukuoka you know what 's crazy is that when we walk on the streets nobody knows that these are Yakuza in the US like gangs they 're heavily involved in drugs do Yakuza people do drugs yeah most most like do drugs what are the most
980,1000,common drugs that they take like heroine they do business also they sell heroins if somebody wants to become a Yakuza what do they have to do they joined the B of group like young people were like bad the Yakuza people see their life they
1000,1020,could join what he 's saying is that you have to walk the lifestyle to be admitted into the gang Boku for example is a rebellious biker gang associated with Japanese youth many kids start out in the subculture before evolving into Yakuza members once you become a Yakuza if you want to leave how can you leave or do you do you just say like okay I 'm done or do you have to like do
1020,1040,something serious to leave they like give a lot of money or they cut their finger or the crew hit hit a guy or something so there are many ways of quit how do you get like a higher ranking like to go up to like the boss so
1040,1060,like one is the people who do business well and the young people go to prison instead of him got it yeah do people have guns here yeah hide hide they hide did you did you have one ah no he he quits so he does n't have gun before
1060,1080,before he has yeah do you miss it do you feel like you want to go back it was really fun they miss sometimes but they do n't want to go back because they do n't have any benefits why are you so open to sharing this information most yakas they want to cover their face why is it okay for
1080,1100,you they they have no regets and they have proud of become Yak so that 's why they do n't need to hide so that 's why they want to share also these guys have been super cool down to earth and it 's just surreal to walk around
1100,1120,these like clean beautiful streets of Fukuoka and here about their crazy stories of chopping off fingers and breaking bones and killing people it 's absolutely bizarre have you seen any Yakuza people walking you did that guy really do you give him like a wink like that 's so crazy it 's like an
1120,1140,undercover Society in my opinion Japan is the most respectful culture in the world so why do Yakuza like steal and kill people like why in Japan people with reason if they afraid the enemy killed their friends or their family they have to
1140,1160,kill first to destroy their company or like they protect their families their friends what does the future look like for the Yakuza like is it growing or is it shrinking Yakuza never gone because like if the Yakuza leave the Chinese Mafia is coming and they like the the balance like Chinese
1160,1180,Mafia do n't come because there Japanese Mafia you know the yak for me it 's like movie I only know them in the movie so I 'm really interested to hear their experience although they are portrayed in movies as stylish Mobsters that 's only one part of the real story beyond their criminal activities the Yakuza sometimes provide order where the government
1180,1200,falls short their involvement in relief efforts during natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis have earned them reluctant respect from the public but their methods have led to widespread fear because they often involve threats and violence today government crackdowns isolate the Yakuza from mainstream society which explains why our friends are so hesitant to speak openly heading into restaurant
1200,1220,here everything about Japan is cool like the moment you walk into a restaurant you just feel happy hello hello hello hello how are you it 's risky to talk about the Yakuza in public so we choose the room upstairs to keep our voices down they keep looking around to see who 's watching because they do n't want to reveal anything that could get them in trouble when I think of the word Yakuza I think of it being really
1220,1240,dangerous people killing each other guns is it really that dangerous yeah it 's true it 's true after he joined the Yakuza like 3 months later his boss was killed what 's the scariest like story that you could tell me his boss was really crazy and his boss told him to
1240,1260,break a girl like he thought he does n't want to do but his boss was crazy and he has to follow do you feel bad about it now right did you go to college no he never graduate high school too really in general how does money work do you have
1260,1280,jobs in Yakuza how do people make money sex industry and also the yak people like lend money and they take more yeah take more if they poor they P together if they reach they reach together they always care about the
1280,1300,their Crews and if their business goes well many beautiful woman comes and they work hard because they got a lot of money how long would were you a Yakuza for years old what was the best and the worst part about being Yakuza the the Yakuza fights it 's like
1300,1320,conflict the people have to kill somebody yeah yeah so that was the best part he said yeah when he won he felt happy and it was best moment what 's the moment police him how many times have you been in
1320,1340,he was in the prison only once when he was like younger like high school he also was CED and he he was in prison like in total 10 years what what what did you get caught for he he hit his
1340,1360,like the stuff uh yeah with the hmer on the head but he did n't die oh that 's awesome is that a requirement like in order to be a KU you have to tattoos it depends on the yaka like if
1360,1380,the yaka Community has much money they can pay for them to make tattoo but if they do n't have much money they do n't tattoos in Japan are historically associated with criminal organizations like the Yakuza members decorate their bodies in elaborate tattoos as a symbol of status and because of this tattoos are very Bo in Japan while
1380,1400,attitudes towards body art are changing you wo n't see a lot of them while walking the streets all right belly 's full and we are following the Yakuza to some NTI spots here my first time in the city so I 'm pumped do n't gabana I can not believe their stories and it 's really interesting to it 's crazy bro yeah it 's really crazy it 's
1400,1420,really crazy but I 'm still scared of that over them because my stereotypes of yaka is really dangerous and easy to get mad and get angry and fight and vient and me do n't piss him off yeah yes yes yes so that 's why I 'm really take care of my speaking Japanese to them I
1420,1440,need to use respect way I hope we do n't die our friends lead us to an underground bar in Fukuoka it is no accident that the Yakuza hang out and hole in- the wall spots like this one here in hushed conversations deals are made and alliances are forged it 's cold
1440,1460,outside man man hot towels cheers strong what do you think
1460,1480,about his life his life is really complicated so there 's nothing to say about him do you support his decisions to join your no she just say like it 's complicated but
1480,1500,it 's it 's okay because his life yeah do the accusers like run all the bars in Tokyo like they run the nlife areas yeah yeah yeah there are lot of bars what happens if a tourist like me goes into a bar and makes a problem with your what what
1500,1520,happened like they will kill me if like you you were drunk and you you know they show something they they trying to stop you but if like they like have some money in trouble they ask you 're L and they just talk so no kill they do n't kill you yeah they do n't kill
1520,1540,you yeah he Li it it someone 's getting wasted over here if you could say one message to
1540,1560,everybody in the world what would you them it 's it 's not easy to change your life but you can do it be happy everyone and do n't never give up what a wild 24 hours it 's been in Japan from exploring Tokyo 's only slum and meeting
1560,1580,its residents who have seemingly been forgotten about to uncovering the secretive world of Yakuza life and learning about their staggering influence on Japanese Society I 've now experienced a darker side of this country that is hard to believe is true listen I know all you guys out there have an obsession with Japan like I do and even after 11 trips here I know that I 'll always be coming back to discover eat and hang out
1580,1600,but if there 's one takeaway from watching this video let it be that even in the Land of the Rising Sun Shadows Run Deep
