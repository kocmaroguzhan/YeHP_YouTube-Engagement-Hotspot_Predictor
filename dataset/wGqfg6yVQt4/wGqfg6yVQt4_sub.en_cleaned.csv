0.08,1.9489999999999998,I'm about to enter a part of Tokyo that
1.959,4.349,is hidden from society the one and only
4.359,7.51,slum called Sonna Tokyo skid R is a
7.52,9.509,place where tourists never visit this
9.519,11.11,small neighborhood has been wiped off
11.12,12.669,Japanese Maps because the government
12.679,14.31,doesn't want you to know that poverty
14.32,16.95,exists here insia Outcast loiter with
16.96,18.75,cheap beer while hostiles advertise
18.76,20.91,rooms at Rock Bottom rates I want to see
20.92,22.269,what a slum looks like in one of the
22.279,24.109,world's richest cities because it's not
24.119,25.71,all fancy restaurants and high-tech
25.72,27.509,gadgets I have three goals while filming
27.519,29.589,in Sonia one to hang out with as many
29.599,31.83,local residents as I can two to try to
31.84,33.59,document the living conditions inside
33.6,35.35,someone's home that's where you sleep
35.36,36.91,and three to meet up with a member of
36.92,39.27,the Yakuza the notorious Japanese gang
39.28,41.029,who run these streets can I see your
43.28,45.75,oh to do all of this I'm meeting up with
45.76,47.549,my local friend Kos who will help me
47.559,49.069,navigate the winding alleys that
49.079,52.95,separate this slum from the rest of
52.96,55.91,Tokyo the taxi just dropped us off I
55.92,57.83,think we're nearby the vibe here is like
57.84,60.31,a post World War II classic Japan ches
60.32,62.349,Town away from all the shiny buildings
62.359,64.109,and neon lights just walking on the
64.119,65.789,street here there's just trash
65.799,67.83,everywhere just piles of trash look at
67.84,70.149,this it already feels different down
70.159,72.149,here than other parts of Tokyo I haven't
72.159,73.67,seen a single Foreigner yet in this
73.68,75.87,whole area and we're in peak season
75.88,77.469,right now cherry blossom season so
77.479,79.23,there's foreigners all over Tokyo maybe
79.24,82.23,I can book your hotel here no please no
82.24,83.95,please no we can't really find it so
83.96,87.749,we're just asking
87.759,90.03,around like on the other side of the
90.04,92.87,Street yeah somewhere in this direction
92.88,98.749,we've been
98.759,102.27,told I it is impossible to find this
102.28,103.91,place unless you know where you're going
103.92,106.429,that's because in 1966 the Japanese
106.439,108.27,government ordered the name Sonia to be
108.28,110.51,removed from all official records it was
110.52,112.63,an attempt to camouflage its association
112.64,115.469,with poverty alcoholism and violence
115.479,116.95,feels a little different right yeah yeah
116.96,122.109,yeah different that's normal it's normal
122.119,123.95,there's a lot of hotels here and when
123.96,126.51,"you look at the prices it's 2,000 Yen a"
126.52,128.669,night which is about $10 anywhere else
128.679,130.589,in Tokyo you can't find a room for under
130.599,135.63,like 70 bucks a
135.64,137.79,night yeah see there's homeless guys
137.8,141.47,already hi Hi how are
144.4,146.589,American what is a typical day in the
146.599,148.79,life of people living here not that
148.8,150.869,Christmas the people living here like
150.879,153.15,they escape from Yakuza oh yeah yeah
153.16,154.79,yeah and they were supported by
154.8,156.55,government are there any Yakuza people
157.56,162.149,here many many there's Yak office really
162.159,163.55,what are some of the crazier things that
163.56,165.509,you've seen living
165.519,168.589,here he saw many people die
168.599,172.149,here he tried to get suicide oh he took

175.8,178.47,suicide uh he get tired over the life is
178.48,181.79,it dangerous here should go oh long long
181.8,183.509,time ago really but they they killed
184.319,187.03,other witnessing riots in Sonia are not
187.04,188.47,common these days but they were an
188.48,190.39,essential part of the slums history
190.4,192.509,after the second world war small tent
192.519,193.75,Villages were set up in this
193.76,195.149,neighborhood for people who are made
195.159,197.11,homeless by us bombings as these
197.12,199.07,Villages turned into cheap hostiles
199.08,201.11,Sonia became populated with bluecollar
201.12,203.309,workers in search of jobs and shelter
203.319,205.03,these are the very men who rebuilt
205.04,207.589,modern Japan the Tokyo Tower facilities
207.599,210.229,for the 1964 Olympics as well as as key
210.239,212.429,roads and highways but now they've been
212.439,214.309,forgotten and are left alone to survive
214.319,216.229,on small pensions while drinking beer
216.239,218.67,and playing board games to pass time I
218.68,221.229,surprised that there is a slum in Tokyo

815.12,817.31,yeah I'm shocked by the contrast between
817.32,819.269,Tokyo and this slum though I believe
819.279,820.99,it's important to highlight the Dignity
821.0,823.35,of those often overlooked but now it's
823.36,825.15,time to take things a step further
825.16,826.55,behind the scenes I've been reaching out
826.56,828.509,to all my Japanese contacts hoping to
828.519,830.509,connect with a real Yakuza after many
830.519,832.71,failed attempts and potential scams I
832.72,834.31,finally got in touch with one guy who
834.32,836.11,will open up to my camera but he lives
836.12,837.99,in the southern part of the country Kos
838.0,839.79,and I are catching a last flight right
839.8,841.59,now to meet him and learn about the wild
841.6,846.71,world of Japan's most dangerous
846.72,848.87,gang all right we just arrived on the
848.88,851.55,outskirts of Fukuoka to meet up with a
851.56,853.509,real life Yakuza it's a little spooky
853.519,854.749,that we're meeting him at night he
854.759,856.749,prefers to meet in the evening so we've
856.759,858.829,showed up at a random parking lot and
858.839,860.59,just waiting for him to arrive are you
862.12,864.67,yeah that's why my mind is
864.68,867.389,think the gangster's name is yuyama and
867.399,869.389,before I start filming he makes me agree
869.399,871.269,to keep things low-key so we don't draw
871.279,873.269,unnecessary attention all I know at this
873.279,874.87,moment is that he grew up with the wrong
874.88,876.79,crowd in Fukuoka fighting and getting
876.8,879.03,into trouble with cops from a young age
879.04,880.31,when you were young did you know that
880.32,883.99,you wanted to become a
884.0,887.389,Yakuza he hated yaka when he was kid he
887.399,890.15,had some problem his heart his back so
890.16,892.47,he he needs money he went to like job
892.48,895.629,hunting that job wasak job can I see
895.639,897.75,your finger
903.04,905.069,he said he must to try to cut and I said
905.079,907.23,no yubitsume is a strict practice that
907.24,909.23,represents loyalty when a Yakuza member
909.24,911.269,fails their Duty they may be required to
911.279,913.03,cut off a portion of their own finger to
913.04,914.71,make up for their mistake this ritual
914.72,916.509,days back centuries and it's a form of
916.519,918.509,psychological manipulation did you cut

965.12,966.55,when we walk on the streets nobody knows
966.56,967.79,that these are
967.8,970.79,Yakuza in the US like gangs they're
970.8,972.91,heavily involved in drugs do Yakuza
972.92,974.87,people do
974.88,978.99,drugs yeah most most like do drugs what
979.0,980.99,are the most common drugs that they
981.0,984.55,take like

987.319,989.59,heroins if somebody wants to become a
989.6,991.749,Yakuza what do they have to
991.759,996.11,do they joined the B of group like young
996.12,998.55,people were like bad the Yakuza people
998.56,1000.949,see their life they could join what he's
1000.959,1002.23,saying is that you have to walk the
1002.24,1004.11,lifestyle to be admitted into the gang
1004.12,1006.749,Boku for example is a rebellious biker
1006.759,1008.91,gang associated with Japanese youth many
1008.92,1010.71,kids start out in the subculture before
1010.72,1012.79,evolving into Yakuza members once you
1012.8,1015.03,become a Yakuza if you want to leave how
1015.04,1016.79,can you leave or do you do you just say
1016.8,1018.629,like okay I'm done or do you have to
1018.639,1022.509,like do something serious to
1022.519,1025.909,leave they like give a lot of money or
1025.919,1030.11,they cut their finger or the crew hit
1030.12,1032.63,hit a guy or something so there are many
1032.64,1034.71,ways of quit how do you get like a
1034.72,1039.27,higher ranking like to go up to like the
1039.28,1042.549,boss so like one is the people who do
1042.559,1046.27,business well and the young people go to
1046.28,1049.07,prison instead of him got it yeah do
1049.08,1050.789,people have guns
1050.799,1053.95,here yeah hide hide they hide did you
1053.96,1055.27,did you have
1055.28,1058.87,one ah no he he quits so he doesn't have
1058.88,1061.35,gun before before he has yeah do you
1061.36,1065.029,miss it do you feel like you want to go
1065.039,1067.59,back it was really fun they miss
1067.6,1069.87,sometimes but they don't want to go back
1069.88,1072.07,because they don't have any benefits why
1072.08,1074.47,are you so open to sharing this
1074.48,1076.43,information most yakas they want to
1076.44,1080.35,cover their face why is it okay for you
1080.36,1082.149,they they have no regets and they have
1082.159,1085.47,proud of become Yak so that's why they
1085.48,1088.07,don't need to hide so that's why they
1088.08,1090.88,want to share
1094.52,1097.669,also these guys have been super cool
1097.679,1099.39,down to earth and it's just surreal to
1099.4,1101.029,walk around these like clean beautiful
1101.039,1102.83,streets of Fukuoka and here about their
1102.84,1104.43,crazy stories of chopping off fingers
1104.44,1106.11,and breaking bones and killing people
1106.12,1108.51,it's absolutely bizarre have you seen
1108.52,1111.789,any Yakuza people walking you did that
1111.799,1116.87,guy really do you give him like a wink
1116.88,1119.71,like that's so crazy it's like an
1119.72,1122.549,undercover Society in my opinion Japan
1122.559,1124.31,is the most respectful culture in the
1124.32,1126.909,world so why do Yakuza like steal and
1126.919,1131.909,kill people like why in
1131.919,1135.71,Japan people with reason if they afraid
1135.72,1138.149,the enemy killed their friends or their
1138.159,1140.71,family they have to kill first to
1140.72,1143.39,destroy their company or like they
1143.4,1145.47,protect their families their friends
1145.48,1146.75,what does the future look like for the
1146.76,1150.07,Yakuza like is it growing or is it
1150.08,1153.43,shrinking Yakuza never gone because like
1153.44,1155.99,if the Yakuza leave the Chinese Mafia is
1156.0,1159.029,coming and they like the the balance
1159.039,1161.71,like Chinese Mafia don't come because
1161.72,1163.87,there Japanese Mafia you know the yak
1163.88,1166.51,for me it's like movie I only know them
1166.52,1169.11,in the movie so I'm really interested to
1169.12,1171.23,hear their experience although they are
1171.24,1173.549,portrayed in movies as stylish Mobsters
1173.559,1175.59,that's only one part of the real story
1175.6,1177.23,beyond their criminal activities the
1177.24,1179.27,Yakuza sometimes provide order where the
1179.28,1181.149,government falls short their involvement
1181.159,1182.71,in relief efforts during natural
1182.72,1184.11,disasters such as earthquakes and
1184.12,1185.909,tsunamis have earned them reluctant
1185.919,1187.35,respect from the public but their
1187.36,1189.19,methods have led to widespread fear
1189.2,1190.83,because they often involve threats and
1190.84,1192.83,violence today government crackdowns
1192.84,1194.47,isolate the Yakuza from mainstream
1194.48,1196.39,society which explains why our friends
1196.4,1198.75,are so hesitant to speak openly heading
1198.76,1201.31,into restaurant here everything about
1201.32,1202.75,Japan is cool like the moment you walk
1202.76,1204.71,into a restaurant you just feel happy
1204.72,1206.75,hello hello hello hello how are you it's
1206.76,1208.75,risky to talk about the Yakuza in public
1208.76,1210.549,so we choose the room upstairs to keep
1210.559,1212.51,our voices down they keep looking around
1212.52,1214.029,to see who's watching because they don't
1214.039,1215.549,want to reveal anything that could get
1215.559,1217.39,them in trouble when I think of the word
1217.4,1219.35,Yakuza I think of it being really
1219.36,1221.87,dangerous people killing each other guns
1221.88,1224.549,is it really that dangerous yeah it's
1224.559,1226.83,true it's true after he joined the
1226.84,1229.149,Yakuza like 3 months later
1229.159,1231.71,his boss was killed what's the scariest
1231.72,1235.11,like story that you could tell
1235.12,1238.43,me his boss was really crazy and his
1238.44,1241.909,boss told him to break a girl like he
1241.919,1244.07,thought he doesn't want to do but his
1244.08,1246.59,boss was crazy and he has to follow do
1246.6,1249.07,you feel bad about it now
1249.08,1251.95,right did you go to
1251.96,1256.029,college no he never graduate high school
1256.039,1258.83,too really in general how does money
1258.84,1261.39,work do you have jobs in Yakuza how do
1261.4,1264.23,people make
1264.24,1267.789,money sex industry and also the yak
1267.799,1270.71,people like lend money and they take
1270.72,1272.549,more yeah take
1272.559,1275.95,more if they poor they P together if
1275.96,1278.149,they reach they reach together they
1278.159,1281.269,always care about the their Crews and if
1281.279,1283.59,their business goes well many beautiful
1283.6,1285.909,woman comes and they work hard because
1285.919,1288.63,they got a lot of money how long would
1288.64,1291.35,were you a Yakuza for years old what was
1291.36,1293.029,the best and the worst part about being
1297.08,1299.909,Yakuza the the Yakuza fights it's like
1299.919,1302.31,conflict the people have to kill
1302.32,1304.149,somebody yeah yeah so that was the best
1304.159,1307.59,part he said yeah when he won he felt
1307.6,1309.75,happy and it was best moment what's the
1313.039,1315.789,moment police
1315.799,1317.909,him how many times have you been in
1321.0,1322.95,he was in the prison only
1322.96,1326.71,once when he was like younger like high
1326.72,1329.95,school he also was CED and he he was in
1329.96,1333.31,prison like in total 10 years what what
1333.32,1334.68,what did you get caught
1337.039,1342.75,for he he hit his like the stuff uh yeah
1342.76,1346.149,with the hmer on the head but he didn't
1346.159,1350.43,die oh
1350.44,1352.789,that's awesome is that a requirement
1352.799,1354.51,like in order to be a KU you have to
1357.48,1359.95,tattoos it depends on the yaka like if
1359.96,1362.909,the yaka Community has much money they
1362.919,1365.63,can pay for them to make tattoo but if
1365.64,1367.95,they don't have much money they don't
1367.96,1369.75,tattoos in Japan are historically
1369.76,1371.59,associated with criminal organizations
1371.6,1373.59,like the Yakuza members decorate their
1373.6,1375.63,bodies in elaborate tattoos as a symbol
1375.64,1377.75,of status and because of this tattoos
1377.76,1380.11,are very Bo in Japan while attitudes
1380.12,1381.99,towards body art are changing you won't
1382.0,1383.23,see a lot of them while walking the
1383.24,1385.269,streets all right belly's full and we
1385.279,1387.909,are following the Yakuza to some NTI
1387.919,1389.83,spots here my first time in the city so
1389.84,1392.789,I'm pumped don't
1392.799,1395.549,gabana I cannot believe their stories
1395.559,1397.71,and it's really interesting to it's
1397.72,1399.51,crazy bro yeah it's really crazy it's
1399.52,1402.71,really crazy but I'm still scared of
1402.72,1404.909,that over them because my stereotypes of
1404.919,1408.669,yaka is really dangerous and easy to get
1408.679,1411.549,mad and get angry and fight and vient
1411.559,1413.99,and me don't piss him off yeah yes
1414.0,1416.23,yes yes so that's why I'm really take
1416.24,1419.549,care of my speaking Japanese to them I
1419.559,1422.269,need to use respect
1422.279,1425.789,way I hope we don't
1425.799,1427.789,die our friends lead us to an
1427.799,1429.99,underground bar in Fukuoka it is no
1430.0,1431.549,accident that the Yakuza hang out and
1431.559,1433.31,hole in- the wall spots like this one
1433.32,1435.47,here in hushed conversations deals are
1435.48,1437.95,made and alliances are forged it's cold
1437.96,1443.51,outside man man hot
1446.32,1451.149,towels cheers
1455.48,1460.99,strong what do you think about his
1461.0,1463.75,life his life is really complicated so
1463.76,1466.51,there's nothing to say about him do you
1466.52,1476.389,support his decisions to join your
1476.399,1479.43,no she just say like it's complicated
1479.44,1483.43,but it's it's okay because his life yeah
1483.44,1486.23,do the accusers like run all the bars in
1486.24,1489.149,Tokyo like they run the nlife areas
1491.72,1494.23,yeah yeah yeah there are lot of bars
1494.24,1495.99,what happens if a tourist like me goes
1496.0,1498.87,into a bar and makes a problem with your
1498.88,1502.789,what what happened like they will kill
1502.799,1506.11,me if like you you were drunk and you

1514.48,1517.789,you're L and they just talk so no kill
1517.799,1519.19,they don't kill you yeah they don't kill
1519.2,1530.909,you yeah
1530.919,1532.07,he Li
1532.08,1537.63,it it someone's getting wasted over
1537.64,1539.909,here if you could say one message to
1539.919,1541.19,everybody in the world what would you
1545.559,1548.269,them it's it's not easy to change your
1548.279,1551.47,life but you can do
1551.48,1554.71,it be happy everyone and don't never
1554.72,1557.269,give up what a wild 24 hours it's been
1557.279,1559.31,in Japan from exploring Tokyo's only
1559.32,1560.909,slum and meeting its residents who have
1560.919,1562.63,seemingly been forgotten about to
1562.64,1564.669,uncovering the secretive world of Yakuza
1564.679,1566.269,life and learning about their staggering
1566.279,1568.389,influence on Japanese Society I've now
1568.399,1569.75,experienced a darker side of this
1569.76,1571.75,country that is hard to believe is true
1571.76,1573.19,listen I know all you guys out there
1573.2,1575.269,have an obsession with Japan like I do
1575.279,1577.35,and even after 11 trips here I know that
1577.36,1579.11,I'll always be coming back to discover
1579.12,1580.83,eat and hang out but if there's one
1580.84,1582.83,takeaway from watching this video let it
1582.84,1584.669,be that even in the Land of the Rising
1584.679,1588.43,Sun Shadows Run Deep
