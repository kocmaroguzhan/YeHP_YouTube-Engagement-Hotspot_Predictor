1.599,3.07,Luke here with the Out Boys YouTube
3.08,4.99,channel and welcome to the interior of
5.0,6.749,Alaska I'm going to be camping in the
6.759,9.11,snow without a tent for the next 3 days
9.12,11.19,I'll be building survival shelters
11.2,13.27,sleeping under animal hides making
13.28,15.549,Bushcraft projects next to the fire and
15.559,17.9,cooking amazing food
45.48,46.99,well we've had a really weird winter
47.0,48.95,here in Alaska and it's been cold then
48.96,51.15,hot then cold again but the good news is
51.16,52.91,the snow's not too deep and the swamps
52.92,54.95,are all Frozen so I can really get out
54.96,56.83,and explore places I otherwise couldn't
64.04,66.63,I got myself pretty wet looks like
66.64,68.23,there's a little ditch or creek here so
68.24,70.07,I stopped to get out and walk it before
70.08,72.429,I tried to take the K truck into it and
72.439,74.39,there's a booby trap right
74.4,77.469,here look at
77.479,80.789,that is just snow floating on water then
80.799,83.31,I walked onto it and sunk into mud up to
83.32,90.99,here I think I'll just go around
91.0,92.67,been driving around for about 2 and 1/2
92.68,94.069,hours and I think it's about time to
94.079,99.55,look for a place to
106.6,118.51,Camp yeah there we
118.52,137.71,go look around for some dead
137.72,140.11,trees it's going to be Pitch Black by
140.12,142.55,400 p.m. today I have about an hour and
142.56,144.55,a half before Sunset and it's really
144.56,155.09,hard to find dead trees in the dark
160.159,161.869,there's an invasive Beetle called the
161.879,164.07,Japanese Spruce bark Beetle it's wiping
164.08,165.869,out a lot of the spruce trees in this
165.879,167.99,area so a lot of the trees are sick or
168.0,169.949,dead in the summertime this place is a
169.959,172.35,massive forest fire hazard so burning up
172.36,174.229,the dead trees in the winter time can
174.239,183.19,actually be a real good thing
183.2,185.67,seems like a lot of wood but it's not if
185.68,187.789,you want to keep warm for 18 hours of
187.799,190.589,Darkness Plus have a shelter it takes a
190.599,192.75,lot Sun's setting I got to bust out my
192.76,194.869,lights I use these bicycle lights that
194.879,196.149,have a GoPro
196.159,198.83,Mount I got this on a trip to Kyoto when
198.84,219.69,Tommy was just little
231.519,233.39,got to get a fire going and dry my pants
233.4,235.429,off it's not a big deal while I'm moving
235.439,237.509,around but once I stop to eat dinner
237.519,251.509,it's going to get real cold
251.519,253.589,always got to make sure to put your
253.599,255.869,flint and steel away so easy to get
255.879,257.59,focused on the fire and then drop it in
257.6,261.79,the snow and lose
261.8,274.749,it everything's covered in snow
274.759,276.59,everything's covered in ice and snow so
276.6,278.99,I put the firewood around the fire until
279.0,280.95,it starts to catch then I put it out and
280.96,324.21,stack it up next to the fire
383.4,384.95,I don't have enough limbs to cover it
384.96,386.79,all the way to the top but that'll make
386.8,416.11,a good wind break
416.12,417.99,all this wood covered in ice and snow
418.0,419.07,we're going to prop it up against the
419.08,427.589,Heat Flector and dry it
429.16,432.029,oh just looked at my clock and it's
432.039,435.029,7:30 so just about 5 hours to cut down
435.039,436.83,all these trees and build this shelter
436.84,438.79,pretty proud of that that's uh it's a
438.8,442.11,lot of wood I cut shelter is obviously
442.12,443.83,not as good as it could be but it's good
443.84,446.309,as it's going to be tonight hang up my
446.319,448.51,clothes and let them
448.52,452.39,dry gloves are wet boots are wet these
452.4,455.15,logs are frozen and covered in ice makes
455.16,456.629,them really cold and it's going to get
456.639,482.43,me wet so we got to dry them
482.44,483.79,there you go I brought some Caribou
483.8,486.469,hides to sleep on I'm getting old I need
486.479,490.39,I need
490.4,492.99,padding brought along a buffalo hide to
493.0,496.869,as a
496.879,499.55,blanket tired need to get some dinner
517.68,519.149,tell you what I really like these heat
519.159,520.949,reflectors when you build a wall behind
520.959,523.149,your fire it absorbs the heat of the
523.159,524.829,fire and then reflects it back towards
524.839,526.71,you but more importantly it acts as a
526.72,528.15,wind break and keeps the wind from
528.16,529.75,blowing the smoke in your face it's
530.68,533.509,nice all right for dinner I've got moose
533.519,535.71,fajitas I prepped up all the meat and
535.72,537.43,Seasonings and vegetables and everything
537.44,539.15,in this little package and froze it now
539.16,540.35,I'm just going to put it in a pot of
540.36,542.55,boiling water to heat it back up not a
542.56,544.19,bad meal when you don't have time to do
553.36,555.47,stuff got a moose vitao with a little
555.48,557.03,bit of
557.04,559.79,guacamole oh I'm hungry it's about 900
559.8,568.35,p.m. I haven't eaten since
569.92,585.03,M oh that's good all right let's do the
585.04,587.71,dishes I have a little bit of firewood
587.72,589.15,but not enough to get me through the
589.16,590.75,rest of the night I need to go cut some
590.76,609.509,more firewood
609.519,610.59,I'm going to sit here and eat some
610.6,612.11,chocolate covered almonds and dry my
612.12,615.509,boots out oh I'm so tired oh it's
615.519,624.11,already 10 p.m. I got to get to bed here
624.12,626.91,soon oh if I go to bed with wet socks my
626.92,629.069,feet are going to be so cold and if I
629.079,631.43,don't dry my boots out they'll freeze in
631.44,632.75,the morning and I won't be able to get
632.76,634.069,them on cuz they'll just be like as
634.079,636.35,solid as a rock now I've got to go and
636.36,638.629,dry out my boots dry out my pants dry
638.639,640.069,out my
640.079,646.629,socks at that steam coming off
646.639,648.91,there all right it's time to cuddle up
648.92,652.269,with my Buffalo hide go to
652.279,654.59,sleep probably have to stoke the fire
654.6,657.55,every 3 4 hours but that's pretty normal
657.56,658.509,all right guys I'll see you in the
663.279,666.19,hey good morning oh this Fire's been
666.2,668.55,keeping this place really warm keep
668.56,670.15,forgetting how cold it is and then the
670.16,671.87,fire will die down I'll be like dang
671.88,674.629,it's really cold
674.639,677.15,out long as the fire is roaring this
677.16,679.31,place holds the heat pretty well all
679.32,681.509,right I think it's time to get up try to
681.519,713.91,make some breakfast
723.44,725.389,going to rub some butter on this warm
725.399,734.629,tortilla and put cinnamon sugar on
734.639,737.55,it that's good if you ever had cinnamon
737.56,742.67,toast or a soap AIA kind of tastes like
742.68,745.47,that got some steel cut Irish oatmeal
745.48,748.15,here this the good stuff little butter
748.16,753.03,brown sugar and raisins
753.04,754.67,it's about 9:30 in the morning and you
754.68,755.829,can start to see a little bit of light
755.839,758.23,out Sun's going to rise in about 45
758.24,760.99,minutes oh well that was good I got to
761.0,768.59,do the dishes
768.6,771.069,now it's about 10:00 and looks like the
771.079,786.189,sun's up need to get to work here
786.199,793.05,all righty
861.399,863.389,this thatching only does a marginal job
863.399,865.47,of keeping the wind out but once you get
865.48,867.31,a little bit of snow on top of it then
867.32,869.47,it's absolutely airtight the trick is
869.48,870.949,that you got to make it thick enough and
870.959,872.87,far enough away from the fire that when
872.88,874.71,you got a nice big roaring fire in here
874.72,876.189,you don't have drips of water from
876.199,907.509,melting snow hopefully we got it right
907.519,909.11,well that's not too shabby that's a
909.12,910.91,proper wall I think the next thing I
910.92,912.71,want to do is improve my bed it was a
912.72,914.79,little bit narrow last night I kept
914.8,916.99,trying to roll off and I wouldn't mind
917.0,923.749,having that foot rest a bit bigger
923.759,926.23,too dry out this log before I put it in
926.24,930.47,my bed
930.48,932.87,I piled up a bunch of logs over there as
932.88,934.829,a bit of a Windbreak to keep cold air
934.839,936.67,from going underneath my bed now they
936.68,938.069,got the shelter built I don't think it's
938.079,939.55,really necessary so I'm going to use
939.56,977.829,that for my firewood tonight
977.839,979.71,shelter's feeling nice and tidy the
979.72,981.829,bed's feeling better I got more of a
981.839,984.67,platform got some firewood drying I
984.68,998.03,think it's time to eat some food
998.04,999.91,a friend of mine gave me these hot dogs
999.92,1001.629,I think they're made out of caribou
1001.639,1003.99,excited to try them
1004.0,1016.829,out M oh smell
1016.839,1019.47,good that's a good hot dog
1019.48,1028.99,I think I worked up a two hot dog
1029.0,1030.829,appetite but I want to do a little
1030.839,1032.549,project I want to build a cooking
1032.559,1038.189,griddle this is a 22 gauge weldable
1038.199,1042.51,steel that's not very
1042.52,1045.59,even it's an ugly freehand oval right
1051.76,1055.43,I got this little stump Anvil right
1055.44,1058.07,here you don't need anything fancy like
1058.08,1072.63,this A rock will
1072.64,1074.99,do just put a little lip on the edge of
1075.0,1077.19,it knocked off all the sharp bits now
1077.2,1079.43,it's uh really stiff and rigid and uh
1079.44,1081.83,your food won't spill off the edge got a
1081.84,1084.549,little bit of Steel Rod here heat that
1084.559,1125.87,up in the fire
1125.88,1129.68,there we go
1158.799,1169.029,all right
1169.039,1170.63,that's a little griddle it's kind of
1170.64,1172.63,ugly shaped but that's what happens when
1172.64,1174.83,you do it freehand but now I got to
1174.84,1178.35,season it got a little peanut
1178.36,1184.07,oil and get the handles
1184.08,1190.75,too let that
1190.76,1201.98,bake do a couple layers
1205.84,1208.23,seasoned frying pan it's ready for
1208.24,1210.549,cooking well it's about 6:30 and I think
1210.559,1213.19,it's time for dinner so for dinner I got
1213.2,1216.51,something special got king crab legs
1216.52,1218.11,last winter I went up to gnome with my
1218.12,1220.07,son Nathan and we caught king crab
1220.08,1222.83,through the
1222.84,1225.71,ice I've got this little jar with garlic
1225.72,1227.549,and butter in it just kind of Loos in
1227.559,1240.95,the lid sit that right by the
1240.96,1255.07,fire look at the size of that crab
1255.08,1259.19,leg oh that was so warm and delicious
1259.2,1260.83,when you cook the crabs over the fire
1260.84,1263.39,too it makes their shells brittle makes
1263.4,1266.07,it a lot easier to Shell them you just
1266.08,1268.95,use your
1268.96,1271.83,hands you got to eat quick things cool
1271.84,1275.47,off really quick around
1275.48,1278.35,here look at that that's just from one
1278.36,1283.35,knuckle barely fits in the
1283.36,1291.029,jar oh that's messy but good
1291.039,1293.669,got a full belly and a big fire going to
1293.679,1295.83,listen to an audiobook just kind of
1295.84,1299.71,relax for an hour or so before
1299.72,1302.83,bedtime oh it's getting late I should
1302.84,1304.99,hop into bed definitely feel like this
1305.0,1307.149,shelter is a lot warmer than yesterday
1307.159,1309.669,the air is just not moving as much I got
1309.679,1311.909,the heat reflecting off this sidew wall
1311.919,1313.43,and and the whole thing's just a better
1316.84,1319.19,Block it's nice having a little bit more
1319.2,1321.51,of a platform to stand on got more room
1321.52,1324.07,to dry my
1324.08,1326.95,boots forgot to dry my socks out before
1326.96,1328.99,going to bed but uh with this nice
1329.0,1330.71,little step right here I can just stick
1330.72,1333.269,my feet out they're all nice and toasty

1335.64,1341.95,see you guys in a little
1341.96,1344.549,bit had to stoked the fire a couple
1344.559,1350.11,times but stayed warm but my back is

1477.76,1479.59,curious to see how it performs in bad
1479.6,1481.269,weather though maybe I can come back
1481.279,1483.149,during a snowstorm and see how the
1484.08,1488.11,does all
1488.12,1490.47,right all right let's see if the car
