0,5,Luke here with the Out Boys YouTube channel and welcome to the interior of
5,10,Alaska I 'm going to be camping in the Alaska I 'm going to be camping in the snow without a tent for the next 3 days I 'll be
10,15,building survival shelters sleeping under animal hides making Bushcraft projects next to
15,20,the fire and cooking amazing food
45,50,well we 've had a really weird winter here in Alaska and it 's been cold then hot then cold
50,55,again but the good news is the snow 's not too deep and the swamps are all Frozen so I can really get out
55,60,and explore places I otherwise could n't
60,65,I got myself
65,70,pretty wet looks like there 's a little ditch or creek here so I stopped to get out and walk it
70,75,before I tried to take the K truck into it and there 's a booby trap right
75,80,here look at that is just snow floating on
80,85,water then I walked onto it and sunk into mud up to here I
85,90,think I 'll just go around
90,95,been driving around for about 2 and 1/2 hours and I think it 's about time to
95,100,look for a place to
105,110,Camp
110,115,yeah there we
120,125,go look around for some dead
135,140,trees it 's going to be Pitch Black
140,145,by 400 p.m. today I have about an hour and a half before Sunset and it 's really
145,150,hard to find dead trees in the dark
160,165,there 's an invasive Beetle called the Japanese Spruce bark Beetle it 's wiping out a lot of the
165,170,spruce trees in this area so a lot of the trees are sick or dead in the summertime this place is a
170,175,massive forest fire hazard so burning up the dead trees in the winter time can
175,180,actually be a real good thing
180,185,seems like a lot of wood but
185,190,it 's not if you want to keep warm for 18 hours of Darkness Plus have a shelter
190,195,it takes a lot Sun 's setting I got to bust out my lights I use these bicycle lights that
195,200,have a GoPro Mount I got this on a trip to Kyoto when
200,205,Tommy was just little
230,235,got to get a fire going and dry my pants off it 's not a big deal while I
235,240,'m moving around but once I stop to eat dinner it
240,245,'s going to get real cold
250,255,always got to make sure to put your flint and steel away
255,260,so easy to get focused on the fire and then drop it in the snow
260,265,and lose it
265,270,everything 's covered in snow
275,280,everything 's covered in ice and snow so I put the firewood around the fire until it starts to catch
280,285,then I put it out and
285,290,stack it up next to the fire
380,385,I do n't have enough limbs to cover it
385,390,all the way to the top but that 'll make a
390,395,good wind break
415,420,all this wood covered in ice and snow we 're going to prop it up against the
420,425,Heat Flector and dry it
425,430,oh just
430,435,looked at my clock and it 's 7:30 so just about 5 hours to cut
435,440,down all these trees and build this shelter pretty proud of that that 's uh it 's a lot of wood I
440,445,cut shelter is obviously not as good as it could be but it 's good as it 's going to
445,450,be tonight hang up my clothes and let them dry gloves
450,455,are wet boots are wet these logs are frozen and covered in ice
455,460,makes them really cold and it 's going to get me
460,465,wet so we got to dry them
480,485,there you go I brought some Caribou hides to sleep on
485,490,I 'm getting old I need I
490,495,need padding brought along a buffalo hide to
495,500,as a blanket tired need to get some dinner
515,520,tell you what I really like these heat reflectors when
520,525,you build a wall behind your fire it absorbs the heat of the fire and then reflects it back towards
525,530,you but more importantly it acts as a wind break and keeps the wind from blowing the smoke in your face it 's
530,535,nice all right for dinner I 've got moose fajitas I prepped up all
535,540,the meat and Seasonings and vegetables and everything in this little package and froze it now I 'm just going to put it
540,545,in a pot of boiling water to heat it back up not a bad meal when you do n't have time to do
550,555,stuff got a moose vitao with
555,560,a little bit of guacamole oh I 'm hungry it 's about 900
560,565,p.m. I have n't eaten since
570,575,M oh that 's good all right let 's do the
585,590,dishes I have a little bit of firewood but not enough to get me through the rest of the night I
590,595,need to go cut some
595,600,more firewood
605,610,I 'm going to
610,615,sit here and eat some chocolate covered almonds and dry my boots out oh I 'm so tired oh
615,620,it 's already 10 p.m. I
620,625,got to get to bed here soon oh if I
625,630,go to bed with wet socks my feet are going to be so cold and if I do n't dry my
630,635,boots out they 'll freeze in the morning and I wo n't be able to get them on cuz they 'll just be like as solid as a
635,640,rock now I 've got to go and dry out my boots dry out my pants dry out
640,645,my socks at that steam
645,650,coming off there all right it 's time to cuddle up with my
650,655,Buffalo hide go to sleep probably have to stoke the fire
655,660,every 3 4 hours but that 's pretty normal all right guys I 'll see you in the
660,665,hey good morning oh
665,670,this Fire 's been keeping this place really warm keep forgetting how cold it is and then
670,675,the fire will die down I 'll be like dang it 's really cold out
675,680,long as the fire is roaring this place holds the heat pretty well all right I
680,685,think it 's time to get up try to
685,690,make some breakfast
720,725,going to rub some butter on
725,730,this warm tortilla and put
730,735,cinnamon sugar on it
735,740,that 's good if you ever had cinnamon toast or a soap
740,745,AIA kind of tastes like that got some steel cut Irish
745,750,oatmeal here this the good stuff little butter brown
750,755,sugar and raisins it 's about 9:30 in the morning and you can start
755,760,to see a little bit of light out Sun 's going to rise in about 45 minutes oh well that
760,765,was good I got to do the
765,770,dishes now it 's about 10:00
770,775,and looks like the sun 's
775,780,up need to get to work here
785,790,all
790,795,righty
860,865,this thatching only does a marginal job of keeping the wind out but
865,870,once you get a little bit of snow on top of it then it 's absolutely airtight the trick is that you got
870,875,to make it thick enough and far enough away from the fire that when you got a nice big roaring fire in here you do
875,880,n't have drips of water from
880,885,melting snow hopefully we got it right
905,910,well that 's not too shabby that 's a proper wall I
910,915,think the next thing I want to do is improve my bed it was a little bit narrow last night I kept
915,920,trying to roll off and I would n't mind having that
920,925,foot rest a bit bigger too dry out this
925,930,log before I put it in my
930,935,bed I piled up a bunch of logs over there as a bit of a Windbreak to keep cold air
935,940,from going underneath my bed now they got the shelter built I do n't think it 's really necessary so I 'm going to use
940,945,that for my firewood tonight
975,980,shelter 's feeling nice and tidy the bed
980,985,'s feeling better I got more of a platform got some firewood drying I
985,990,think it 's time to eat some food
995,1000,a friend of mine gave me these hot dogs I
1000,1005,think they 're made out of caribou excited to try them
1005,1010,out M oh smell
1015,1020,good that 's a good hot dog I
1020,1025,think I worked up a two hot dog
1025,1030,appetite but I
1030,1035,want to do a little project I want to build a cooking griddle this
1035,1040,is a 22 gauge weldable steel
1040,1045,that 's not very even it 's an ugly freehand
1045,1050,oval right
1050,1055,I got this little stump Anvil
1055,1060,right here you do n't need anything fancy like
1060,1065,this A rock will
1070,1075,do just put a little lip on the edge of
1075,1080,it knocked off all the sharp bits now it knocked off all the sharp bits now it 's uh really stiff and rigid and uh your
1080,1085,food wo n't spill off the edge got a little bit of Steel Rod here heat that
1085,1090,up in the fire
1125,1130,there we go
1160,1165,all right
1165,1170,that 's a little
1170,1175,griddle it 's kind of ugly shaped but that 's what happens when you do it freehand but now I got to
1175,1180,season it got a little peanut oil
1180,1185,and get the handles
1185,1190,too let that
1190,1195,bake do a
1195,1200,couple layers
1205,1210,seasoned frying pan it 's ready for cooking well it 's about 6:30
1210,1215,and I think it 's time for dinner so for dinner I got something special
1215,1220,got king crab legs last winter I went up to gnome with my son Nathan and we caught king
1220,1225,crab through the ice I 've got this little jar
1225,1230,with garlic and butter in it just kind of Loos in the
1230,1235,lid sit that right by the
1240,1245,fire
1245,1250,look at the size of that crab
1255,1260,leg oh that was so warm and delicious when you cook the
1260,1265,crabs over the fire too it makes their shells brittle makes it a lot easier to
1265,1270,Shell them you just use your hands you got
1270,1275,to eat quick things cool off really quick
1275,1280,around here look at that that 's just from one knuckle
1280,1285,barely fits in the jar
1285,1290,oh that 's messy but good
1290,1295,got a full belly and a big fire going to listen to an
1295,1300,audiobook just kind of relax for an hour or so before
1300,1305,bedtime oh it 's getting late I should hop into bed definitely feel like this
1305,1310,shelter is a lot warmer than yesterday shelter is a lot warmer than yesterday the air is just not moving as much I got the
1310,1315,heat reflecting off this sidew wall and and the whole thing 's just a better
1315,1320,Block it 's nice having a little bit more of a
1320,1325,platform to stand on got more room to dry my boots
1325,1330,forgot to dry my socks out before going to bed but uh with this nice little step right
1330,1335,here I can just stick my feet out they 're all nice and toasty I 'm going to put the
1335,1340,camera down I 'll see you guys in a
1340,1345,little bit had to stoked the fire a couple
1345,1350,times but stayed warm but my back is
1350,1355,sore oh oh my back feel like I was run
1355,1360,over by a truck but I 'm
1360,1365,warm well it 's about 7:30 I think it 's time to go test out that gridle and make

1470,1475,worked really well all
1475,1480,right this is a really nice shelter I 'm curious to see how it performs in bad weather
1480,1485,though maybe I can come back during a snowstorm and see how the
1485,1490,does all right all right let 's see if
1490,1495,the car starts when it gets really cold my K truck freezes up and wo n't
1495,1500,start but uh it 's a bit of a ways home so uh hopefully it
