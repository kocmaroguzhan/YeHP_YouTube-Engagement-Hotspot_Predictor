0,20,Luke here with the Out Boys YouTube channel and welcome to the interior of Alaska I 'm going to be camping in the snow without a tent for the next 3 days I 'll be building survival shelters sleeping under animal hides making Bushcraft projects next to the fire and cooking amazing food
40,60,well we 've had a really weird winter here in Alaska and it 's been cold then hot then cold again but the good news is the snow 's not too deep and the swamps are all Frozen so I can really get out and explore places I otherwise could n't
60,80,I got myself pretty wet looks like there 's a little ditch or creek here so I stopped to get out and walk it before I tried to take the K truck into it and there 's a booby trap right here look at that is just snow floating on
80,100,water then I walked onto it and sunk into mud up to here I think I 'll just go around been driving around for about 2 and 1/2 hours and I think it 's about time to look for a place to
100,120,Camp yeah there we
120,140,go look around for some dead trees it 's going to be Pitch Black
140,160,by 400 p.m. today I have about an hour and a half before Sunset and it 's really hard to find dead trees in the dark
160,180,there 's an invasive Beetle called the Japanese Spruce bark Beetle it 's wiping out a lot of the spruce trees in this area so a lot of the trees are sick or dead in the summertime this place is a massive forest fire hazard so burning up the dead trees in the winter time can actually be a real
180,200,good thing seems like a lot of wood but it 's not if you want to keep warm for 18 hours of Darkness Plus have a shelter it takes a lot Sun 's setting I got to bust out my lights I use these bicycle lights that have a GoPro Mount I got this on a trip to Kyoto when
200,220,Tommy was just little
220,240,got to get a fire going and dry my pants off it 's not a big deal while I 'm moving around but once I stop to eat dinner it
240,260,'s going to get real cold always got to make sure to put your flint and steel away so easy to get focused on the fire and then drop it in the snow
260,280,and lose it everything 's covered in snow everything 's covered in ice and snow so I put the firewood around the fire until it starts to catch
280,300,then I put it out and stack it up
300,320,next to the fire
380,400,I do n't have enough limbs to cover it all the way to the top but that 'll make a good
400,420,wind break all this wood covered in ice and snow we 're going to prop it up against the
420,440,Heat Flector and dry it oh just looked at my clock and it 's 7:30 so just about 5 hours to cut down all these trees and build this shelter pretty proud of that that 's uh it 's a lot of wood I
440,460,cut shelter is obviously not as good as it could be but it 's good as it 's going to be tonight hang up my clothes and let them dry gloves are wet boots are wet these logs are frozen and covered in ice makes them really cold and it 's going to get me
460,480,wet so we got to dry them
480,500,there you go I brought some Caribou hides to sleep on I 'm getting old I need I need padding brought along a buffalo hide to as a blanket tired need to get some dinner
500,520,tell you what I really like these heat reflectors when
520,540,you build a wall behind your fire it absorbs the heat of the fire and then reflects it back towards you but more importantly it acts as a wind break and keeps the wind from blowing the smoke in your face it 's nice all right for dinner I 've got moose fajitas I prepped up all the meat and Seasonings and vegetables and everything in this little package and froze it now I 'm just going to put it
540,560,in a pot of boiling water to heat it back up not a bad meal when you do n't have time to do stuff got a moose vitao with a little bit of guacamole oh I 'm hungry it 's about 900
560,580,p.m. I have n't eaten since M oh that 's good all
580,600,right let 's do the dishes I have a little bit of firewood but not enough to get me through the rest of the night I need to go cut some more
600,620,firewood I 'm going to sit here and eat some chocolate covered almonds and dry my boots out oh I 'm so tired oh it 's already 10 p.m. I
620,640,got to get to bed here soon oh if I go to bed with wet socks my feet are going to be so cold and if I do n't dry my boots out they 'll freeze in the morning and I wo n't be able to get them on cuz they 'll just be like as solid as a rock now I 've got to go and dry out my boots dry out my pants dry out
640,660,my socks at that steam coming off there all right it 's time to cuddle up with my Buffalo hide go to sleep probably have to stoke the fire every 3 4 hours but that 's pretty normal all right guys I 'll see you in the
660,680,hey good morning oh this Fire 's been keeping this place really warm keep forgetting how cold it is and then the fire will die down I 'll be like dang it 's really cold out long as the fire is roaring this place holds the heat pretty well all right I
680,700,think it 's time to get up try to make some
700,720,breakfast
720,740,going to rub some butter on this warm tortilla and put cinnamon sugar on it that 's good if you ever had cinnamon toast or a soap
740,760,AIA kind of tastes like that got some steel cut Irish oatmeal here this the good stuff little butter brown sugar and raisins it 's about 9:30 in the morning and you can start to see a little bit of light out Sun 's going to rise in about 45 minutes oh well that
760,780,was good I got to do the dishes now it 's about 10:00 and looks like the sun 's up need to
780,800,get to work here all righty
860,880,this thatching only does a marginal job of keeping the wind out but once you get a little bit of snow on top of it then it 's absolutely airtight the trick is that you got to make it thick enough and far enough away from the fire that when you got a nice big roaring fire in here you do n't have drips of water from
880,900,melting snow hopefully we got it right
900,920,well that 's not too shabby that 's a proper wall I think the next thing I want to do is improve my bed it was a little bit narrow last night I kept trying to roll off and I would n't mind having that
920,940,foot rest a bit bigger too dry out this log before I put it in my bed I piled up a bunch of logs over there as a bit of a Windbreak to keep cold air from going underneath my bed now they got the shelter built I do n't think it 's really necessary so I 'm going to use
940,960,that for my firewood tonight
960,980,shelter 's feeling nice and tidy the bed
980,1000,'s feeling better I got more of a platform got some firewood drying I think it 's time to eat some food a friend of mine gave me these hot dogs I
1000,1020,think they 're made out of caribou excited to try them out M oh smell good that 's a good hot dog I
1020,1040,think I worked up a two hot dog appetite but I want to do a little project I want to build a cooking griddle this is a 22 gauge weldable steel
1040,1060,that 's not very even it 's an ugly freehand oval right I got this little stump Anvil right here you do n't need anything fancy like
1060,1080,this A rock will do just put a little lip on the edge of it knocked off all the sharp bits now it 's uh really stiff and rigid and uh your
1080,1100,food wo n't spill off the edge got a little bit of Steel Rod here heat that up in
1100,1120,the fire
1120,1140,there we go
1160,1180,all right that 's a little griddle it 's kind of ugly shaped but that 's what happens when you do it freehand but now I got to season it got a little peanut oil
1180,1200,and get the handles too let that bake do a couple
1200,1220,layers seasoned frying pan it 's ready for cooking well it 's about 6:30 and I think it 's time for dinner so for dinner I got something special got king crab legs last winter I went up to gnome with my son Nathan and we caught king
1220,1240,crab through the ice I 've got this little jar with garlic and butter in it just kind of Loos in the lid sit that right by
1240,1260,the fire look at the size of that crab leg oh that was so warm and delicious when you cook the
1260,1280,crabs over the fire too it makes their shells brittle makes it a lot easier to Shell them you just use your hands you got to eat quick things cool off really quick around here look at that that 's just from one knuckle
1280,1300,barely fits in the jar oh that 's messy but good got a full belly and a big fire going to listen to an audiobook just kind of relax for an hour or so before
1300,1320,bedtime oh it 's getting late I should hop into bed definitely feel like this shelter is a lot warmer than yesterday the air is just not moving as much I got the heat reflecting off this sidew wall and and the whole thing 's just a better Block it 's nice having a little bit more of a
1320,1340,platform to stand on got more room to dry my boots forgot to dry my socks out before going to bed but uh with this nice little step right here I can just stick my feet out they 're all nice and toasty I 'm going to put the camera down I 'll see you guys in a
1340,1360,little bit had to stoked the fire a couple times but stayed warm but my back is sore oh oh my back feel like I was run over by a truck but I
1360,1380,'m warm well it 's about 7:30 I think it 's time to go test out that gridle and make breakfast okay
1380,1400,corn beef hash oh it 's so
1400,1420,Frozen yeah it 's pretty non thick slid right off
1420,1440,corn beef and hash egg M oh that is so good tell you what that little Skillet worked really well pretty easy to make too oh that was
1440,1460,delicious I would n't mind another one of those tell you that was a good meal I 'm definitely going to have to do that one again but uh I think it 's time to get packed up I 'm
1460,1480,going to try to get home by 12 : and I 've got a long way to drive to get there so I think I better not wait for the sun to come up I 'll tell you what I liked my little Grill worked really well all right this is a really nice shelter I 'm curious to see how it performs in bad weather
1480,1500,though maybe I can come back during a snowstorm and see how the does all right all right let 's see if the car starts when it gets really cold my K truck freezes up and wo n't start but uh it 's a bit of a ways home so uh hopefully it
1500,1520,'ll start up on me ah sure is nice when things work yeah you definitely want to make sure that car is working before you put your fire
