15,20,"Hi . My name is Cameron Russell , and for the"
20,25,"last little while , I 've been a model ."
25,30,"Actually , for 10 years . And I feel"
30,35,like there 's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this
35,40,"dress . So luckily , I brought an outfit change . This"
40,45,"is the first outfit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky"
45,50,"to witness it , I think . If some of the women were really horrified when I came out , you do n't have"
50,55,"to tell me now , but I 'll find out later on Twitter ."
55,60,I 'd also note that I 'm quite privileged to be
60,65,able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10
65,70,seconds . Not everybody gets to do that . These heels are very
70,75,"uncomfortable , so good thing I was n't going to wear them . The worst"
75,80,"part is putting this sweater over my head , because that 's when you 'll all laugh at me , so do n't do"
80,85,anything while it 's over my head . All right .
85,90,"So , why did I do that ? That was"
90,95,awkward . Well --
95,100,Hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
100,105,"Image is powerful , but also , image"
105,110,is superficial . I just totally
110,115,"transformed what you thought of me , in six seconds . And in this picture , I had"
115,120,"actually never had a boyfriend in real life . I was totally uncomfortable , and"
120,125,the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy 's hair .
125,130,"And of course , barring surgery , or the fake tan that I"
130,135,"got two days ago for work , there 's very little that we can do to transform how"
135,140,"we look , and how we look , though it is superficial and immutable , has a huge"
140,145,"impact on our lives . So today , for me ,"
145,150,being fearless means being honest . And I am on this stage
150,155,"because I am a model . I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in"
155,160,"my industry , we call that a sexy girl . I 'm going to answer the questions that people always"
160,165,"ask me , but with an honest twist . So the first question is , how do you become a model ? I always"
165,170,"just say , "" Oh , I was scouted , "" but that means nothing . The real way that I"
170,175,"became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you"
175,180,"'re wondering what is a legacy . Well , for the past few centuries we have"
180,185,defined beauty not just as health and youth and
185,190,"symmetry that we 're biologically programmed to admire , but also as"
190,195,"tall , slender figures , and femininity and white"
195,200,"skin . And this is a legacy that was built for me , and it 's a legacy that I 've been cashing out on . And I"
200,205,"know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some"
205,210,"fashionistas who are like , "" Wait . Naomi . Tyra . Joan Smalls . Liu Wen . "" And first , I commend you on your"
210,215,"model knowledge . Very impressive . But unfortunately , I"
215,220,"have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted"
220,225,"all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the 677 models"
225,230,"that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non - white ."
230,235,"The next question people always ask is , "" Can I be a model when I grow up ? "" And the"
235,240,"first answer is , "" I do n't know , they do n't put me in charge of that . "" But the second answer , and"
240,245,"what I really want to say to these little girls is , "" Why ? You know ? You can be anything . You could be"
245,250,"the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a ninja cardiothoracic"
250,255,"surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you 'd be the first one . """
255,260,"If , after this amazing list , they still are like , "" No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , "" well ,"
260,265,"then I say , "" Be my boss . "" Because I 'm not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of"
265,270,"American Vogue or the CEO of H&amp;M , or the next Steven Meisel . Saying that you want to be a model"
270,275,when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up . It 's out of
275,280,"your control , and it 's awesome , and it 's not a career path . I will"
280,285,"demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge , because unlike"
285,290,"cardiothoracic surgeons , it can just be distilled right now . So , if the"
290,295,"photographer is right there , the light is right there , like a nice HMI , and the client says , "" We want a"
295,300,"walking shot , "" this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at"
300,305,"three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary"
305,310,"friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times . It will look something"
310,315,like this . Hopefully less awkward than that one
315,320,"in the middle . That was -- I do n't know what happened there . Unfortunately , after you 've gone to"
320,325,"school , and you have a résumé and you 've done a few jobs , you ca n't say anything anymore , so if you say"
325,330,"you want to be the President of the United States , but your résumé reads , "" Underwear Model : 10 years , """
330,335,"people give you a funny look . The next question is , "" Do they retouch all the photos ? "" And yeah , they pretty"
335,340,"much retouch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what 's happening . This picture"
340,345,"is the very first picture that I ever took , and it 's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini ,"
345,350,"and I did n't even have my period yet . I know we 're getting personal , but I was a young girl ."
350,355,This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier . Here 's me on
355,360,the same day as this shoot . My friend got to come . Here 's me at a slumber party a few days
360,365,before I shot French Vogue . Here 's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine .
365,370,And here 's me today . And I hope what you 're seeing is that
370,375,"these pictures are not pictures of me . They are constructions , and they are constructions by a"
375,380,"group of professionals , by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their"
380,385,"assistants and pre - production and post - production , and they build this . That 's not me . Okay , so"
385,390,"the next question people always ask me is , "" Do you get free stuff ? "" I do have"
390,395,"too many 8 - inch heels which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free"
395,400,"stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that 's what we do n't like to talk"
400,405,"about . I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me"
405,410,"the dress for free . When I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and"
410,415,"she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a "" Sorry , officer , """
415,420,and we were on our way . And I got these free things because
420,425,"of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and"
425,430,"not who they are . I live in New York , and last year , of the 140,000 teenagers that were"
430,435,"stopped and frisked , 86 % of them were black and Latino , and most of them were"
435,440,"young men . And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York , so"
440,445,"for them , it 's not a question of , "" Will I get stopped ? "" but "" How many times will I get stopped ? When will"
445,450,"I get stopped ? "" When I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13 - year - old girls in the"
450,455,"United States , 53 % do n't like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 % by the"
455,460,"time that they 're 17 . So , the last question people ask me"
460,465,"is , "" What is it like to be a model ? "" And I think the answer that they 're looking for is , "" If you are a"
465,470,"little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . """
470,475,"And when we 're backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that . We say , "" It 's really"
475,480,"amazing to travel , and it 's amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate"
480,485,"people . "" And those things are true , but they 're only one half of the story , because the thing that we"
485,490,"never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , "" I am insecure . """
490,495,And I 'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
495,500,"And if you ever are wondering , "" If I have"
500,505,"thinner thighs and shinier hair , will I be happier ? "" you just need to meet a group of models ,"
505,510,"because they have the thinnest thighs , the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes , and they 're the most"
510,515,"physically insecure women probably on the planet . When I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult"
515,520,"to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very uncomfortable to come out"
520,525,"here and say , "" Look I 've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , "" and it also felt"
525,530,"really uncomfortable to follow that up with , "" and it does n't always make me happy . "" But"
530,535,mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression
535,540,when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries . But I 'm also
540,545,happy and honored to be up here and I think that it 's great that I got to come
545,550,"before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I 'd had more agency in my career , because maybe then I would"
550,555,"n't tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I would n't tell the story of how I paid for college ,"
555,560,"which seems so important right now . If there 's a takeaway to this talk , I hope it 's"
560,565,that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our
565,570,perceived successes and our perceived failures . Thank
570,575,you .
