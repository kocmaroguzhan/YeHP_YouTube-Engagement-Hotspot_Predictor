00:00:19.756 --> 00:00:20.756
I'm angry.

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:27.636
And I’m angry because I wish
I knew this when I was younger.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.596
So I’m a neuroscientist and a lecturer.

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:31.756
And as a neuroscientist,

00:00:31.756 --> 00:00:34.716
I study the brain and the nerves
that span out into the body.

00:00:34.876 --> 00:00:39.116
And as a lecturer, I teach the next
generation of healthcare professionals.

00:00:39.596 --> 00:00:44.276
And look, I see some students
struggle with their learning,

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:47.036
especially the older ones,
but it’s not their fault.

00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:49.796
You know, we don't get
taught how to learn.

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:52.396
We just kind of expect it to happen.

00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:57.276
And I think the worst curse of all really
is it gets harder to learn as we age.

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:02.356
But what if I told you that
there are things that we can do

00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:05.556
to learn faster and more effectively?

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:08.356
I’m going to take you
through the neuroscience

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:11.796
behind six critical ingredients
that can help you learn faster:

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:15.036
attention, alertness, sleep,

00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:19.676
repetition, breaks, and mistakes.

00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.596
Now, first things first.
How do we actually learn?

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:25.596
We need neuroplasticity to happen.

00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:29.196
So neuroplasticity is the scientific
term that essentially means

00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:34.156
our brain’s ability to physically
change in response to experience.

00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:38.036
So when we’re learning something,
whether it’s learning information or

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:39.996
learning a skill,

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:42.636
tiny little connections called synapses

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:45.036
form between neighboring
neurons in the brain.

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:49.156
And the more we do that thing,
whether it’s information or a skill,

00:01:49.156 --> 00:01:51.756
the more robust those connections become

00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:54.476
and the better we get
at doing whatever it is.

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.076
Now, what you’re looking at here

00:01:57.076 --> 00:02:00.676
are two neurons that I filmed
in a petri dish connecting.

00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:04.116
Actually, this was a petri dish
that I was about to throw away,

00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:07.276
but I saw they were about to connect,
so I quickly took this video.

00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:12.076
Now, these incredible handlike structures
here are called “growth cones,”

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:13.756
and every neuron has one.

00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:16.356
They actively sense
the environment around,

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:21.076
and they help each and every one
of the 86 billion neurons in your brain

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:23.156
find the correct place to connect to.

00:02:23.156 --> 00:02:24.876
So, for example, from here to here,

00:02:24.876 --> 00:02:26.396
or here to here.

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:29.676
And this isn’t learning.
This doesn’t represent learning.

00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:33.636
What it represents is how our brain
wires itself during development.

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.836
Now, when things go wrong
with that wiring process

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:39.996
or when it doesn't happen
in the usual way,

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:43.276
you can end up with things
like issues with learning and memory.

00:02:44.076 --> 00:02:48.036
Now, kids are a little bit
like sponges, right?

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:50.316
They just seem to need
to be exposed to stuff,

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:52.396
and they seem to remember it.

00:02:52.396 --> 00:02:56.916
Languages, skills, sports, whatever it is,
the learning just happens really quickly.

00:02:57.156 --> 00:03:00.516
Now, have you ever met someone
who’s incredibly talented,

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:01.636
and you just thought,

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:04.196
“Okay, they must have
some magic thing about them

00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:05.796
that the rest of us don’t have.”

00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:09.876
Well, what if I told you that
that's probably not true?

00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:13.076
It mostly comes down
to practice, perseverance,

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:16.756
and when in development,
they started learning that skill.

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:19.436
So the earlier, the better.

00:03:20.196 --> 00:03:22.876
And people like
Serena Williams and Beethoven,

00:03:22.876 --> 00:03:25.196
they weren't born with their skills.

00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:29.036
They practiced, and they all 
actually started by age five.

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:33.636
So really, our ability to learn
goes downhill after age five,

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:36.036
(Laughter)

00:03:36.036 --> 00:03:40.116
but it certainly gets harder
through our childhood, through our teens.

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:44.516
And once we hit our mid-twenties,
it gets exponentially harder to learn.

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:49.836
But the good news is I’m going
to tell you what you can do about it

00:03:49.836 --> 00:03:51.556
because there are things you can do.

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:56.956
You can use attention, alertness,
sleep, repetition, breaks, and mistakes

00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:58.516
to make your learning better.

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.556
So first things first.

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:03.636
In order to learn, we need
to pay attention, right?

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:06.076
Attention is a really important function.

00:04:06.276 --> 00:04:09.396
So, for example, if I were
to ask you to close your eyes

00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:13.236
and focus on your contact
between your feet and the floor,

00:04:14.276 --> 00:04:17.396
you’ll suddenly be aware
of maybe the texture of your socks,

00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:22.596
maybe how tight your shoes are,
maybe how firm the floor is.

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:29.196
And you weren’t aware
of any of that a second ago.

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:34.236
And what that means is that
we have the ability to choose

00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:36.716
how much attention we pay to something.

00:04:37.036 --> 00:04:41.036
And studies have shown that
when we are fully focused on a task,

00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:43.436
we are more likely
to retain that information,

00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:44.876
especially for the long term.

00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:48.116
Now, until the last little
blip in human history,

00:04:48.116 --> 00:04:50.716
we have never had to work
this hard to pay attention.

00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:53.476
Like, let’s be honest, how many
times do you find yourself

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:57.356
rereading or replaying something
because you got a bit distracted?

00:04:57.356 --> 00:04:58.596
Right? Yeah.

00:04:58.876 --> 00:05:01.756
We are designed to focus
on one thing at a time.

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:05.236
There’s no secret that
the frequent context switching

00:05:05.236 --> 00:05:07.276
that happens when we use social media,

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:11.276
so scrolling through our phones
and seeing lots of different bits of

00:05:11.756 --> 00:05:17.996
completely unrelated bits of information
like news, ads, you know, cat videos.

00:05:17.996 --> 00:05:23.796
That results in significantly
measurable attention deficits.

00:05:24.956 --> 00:05:27.036
So I’m not saying it causes ADHD,

00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:32.236
but studies have shown that if you use
your phone for more than an hour in teens,

00:05:32.236 --> 00:05:34.316
that results in these attention deficits.

00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:38.156
So try and use your phone
a little bit less.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.676
Now, if you wanted to improve
your attention in the long term,

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.396
there are things like
focused attention meditation

00:05:45.396 --> 00:05:47.076
that you can do to improve that.

00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:50.796
And if you wanted to improve
your attention in the really short term,

00:05:50.796 --> 00:05:53.516
well, you can actually just exercise.

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:54.676
I know you’re thinking:

00:05:54.676 --> 00:05:57.796
“Oh, well, my doctor always says
I have to exercise and eat well.”

00:05:57.796 --> 00:05:59.196
But hear me out for a second.

00:05:59.196 --> 00:06:03.436
Did you know that exercise
can actually increase the size

00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:06.156
of the part of your brain involved
in learning and memory?

00:06:06.636 --> 00:06:09.036
It also helps you make new brain cells.

00:06:09.316 --> 00:06:13.636
And studies have shown that
regular exercise improves memory.

00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:18.076
It improves cognition,
so your ability to think.

00:06:18.476 --> 00:06:21.356
And just 20 minutes of moderate exercise -

00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:23.996
so not even, you know, intense exercise -

00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:28.636
that will actually improve your attention
for about two hours afterwards.

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:32.436
So here’s what you should do:
if you’re sitting down to study,

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.476
go for a jog,

00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:41.396
do some star jumps.

00:06:41.396 --> 00:06:43.636
It’s even better
if you challenge your balance.

00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:46.716
If you’re at work,
run up and down the stairs.

00:06:46.716 --> 00:06:49.596
There are lots of things that you can do
to make this happen.

00:06:50.116 --> 00:06:51.636
Next, we have...

00:06:52.196 --> 00:06:53.236
(Air horn blasts)

00:06:53.796 --> 00:06:54.796
alertness.

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:57.796
(Laughter)

00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:02.716
In order to learn,
you’ve got to be alert, right?

00:07:02.716 --> 00:07:04.756
It's not rocket science.

00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:07.956
But he’s the thing.

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:12.076
If you’re not fully focused on a task,

00:07:12.076 --> 00:07:15.236
then you’re going to have a harder time
retaining that information.

00:07:15.676 --> 00:07:18.036
Activating our body’s
fight-or-flight system

00:07:18.036 --> 00:07:21.516
or activating our sympathetic
nervous system, as it’s also known,

00:07:21.516 --> 00:07:25.356
results in the release of things
like adrenaline and noradrenaline,

00:07:25.436 --> 00:07:29.356
and amongst other things,
that will increase our alertness.

00:07:30.076 --> 00:07:32.156
So what are some other
things that we can do

00:07:32.156 --> 00:07:34.276
to increase our fight-or-flight system?

00:07:34.316 --> 00:07:37.796
Because obviously, we can’t go around
blasting air horns all the time.

00:07:38.756 --> 00:07:42.316
Well, again, exercise -
a bit of a recurring theme here.

00:07:43.116 --> 00:07:46.436
You can do certain breathing techniques
like Wim Hof breathing.

00:07:46.676 --> 00:07:49.716
You can even end your shower
with a bit of a cold blast of water

00:07:49.716 --> 00:07:52.236
because that will certainly
make you feel very alert.

00:07:52.836 --> 00:07:55.516
And we also know that stress
will do the same thing.

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:59.676
So we know that if you sit down
to learn after a small stressor -

00:07:59.676 --> 00:08:03.596
like this, for example -
that will enhance your learning.

00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:06.716
So what can you do?

00:08:07.036 --> 00:08:08.836
You can have too much stress, though,

00:08:08.836 --> 00:08:11.316
as you can see that
I’m experiencing right now.

00:08:11.716 --> 00:08:15.676
So when you have been experiencing
long-term stress or chronic stress,

00:08:15.956 --> 00:08:17.836
it physically changes our brain,

00:08:17.836 --> 00:08:20.036
and it causes issues
with learning and memory.

00:08:20.196 --> 00:08:23.956
So if you have been experiencing stress
for a long period of time,

00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:25.956
you will have impairments in memory.

00:08:25.956 --> 00:08:28.436
It is that simple,
so do be kind to yourself.

00:08:29.236 --> 00:08:31.356
But little bits of stress are good.

00:08:31.356 --> 00:08:33.956
They actually help you
reach peak performance.

00:08:34.116 --> 00:08:37.276
And we know that having a little bit
of an increase in adrenaline

00:08:37.276 --> 00:08:41.476
after a learning task will actually
enhance your learning as well.

00:08:41.756 --> 00:08:46.156
Now you can also ingest substances
to enhance your alertness,

00:08:46.156 --> 00:08:47.476
things like caffeine.

00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:51.196
And there’s a growing body of evidence now
that shows that having caffeine

00:08:51.196 --> 00:08:55.636
before a learning task or actually
just being a regular caffeine drinker

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:57.716
can enhance your learning and memory

00:08:57.716 --> 00:09:00.196
through a range of different
mechanisms in the brain.

00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:05.716
We know that, for example, if you eat,

00:09:05.716 --> 00:09:09.396
you are less alert because that’s
switching off our fight-or-flight system.

00:09:09.396 --> 00:09:12.556
So maybe don’t sit down
to study after a big meal.

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:16.316
There’s also a limit
to our alertness as well.

00:09:16.876 --> 00:09:19.076
So it's still a little bit contentious,

00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:20.316
but studies have shown

00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:23.876
that we are constantly going through
what we call an “ultradian rhythm.”

00:09:23.876 --> 00:09:28.276
So about every 90 minutes,
we’re going in and out of peak alertness.

00:09:28.476 --> 00:09:32.356
So the reality is you can’t be
100% alert all the time,

00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:36.156
and it’s going to be a chunk of about
8 to 30 minutes in the middle there

00:09:36.156 --> 00:09:37.596
we will be most alert.

00:09:39.956 --> 00:09:42.556
Now, another thing for alertness is sleep.

00:09:42.556 --> 00:09:46.916
Yes, if you haven’t been sleeping,
then, yes, you won’t be as alert.

00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:50.516
But sleep is really important
for learning for another reason.

00:09:50.996 --> 00:09:54.036
So sleep serves a really important
constellation of functions.

00:09:54.036 --> 00:09:58.436
So, for example, it resets our immune
system, it resets our metabolism,

00:09:58.436 --> 00:10:00.596
it resets our emotional control,

00:10:00.836 --> 00:10:04.436
and it even gets rid of the waste
that builds up in our brain

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:05.796
over the course of the day.

00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:09.796
But sleep is actually critical
for memory consolidation,

00:10:09.796 --> 00:10:13.756
so for turning short-term memories
into long-term memories.

00:10:15.316 --> 00:10:18.236
There’s a particular part
of the brain called the hippocampus,

00:10:18.236 --> 00:10:20.516
which is important
for learning and memory.

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:25.076
So when you do stuff throughout the day,
your hippocampus is keeping track of that.

00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:26.396
It’s a bit like a diary.

00:10:26.396 --> 00:10:28.476
So if I were to ask you
what you were doing

00:10:28.476 --> 00:10:31.716
before you sat down
to listen to this talk,

00:10:31.716 --> 00:10:35.156
you’re using your hippocampus
to recall that information.

00:10:35.756 --> 00:10:38.916
But it only keeps information
there for the short term.

00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:42.756
And when you sleep,
all of those short-term memories

00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:46.156
get flitted off to other parts
of the brain, the cortex,

00:10:46.156 --> 00:10:48.076
and turned into long-term memories.

00:10:48.076 --> 00:10:49.596
So if you don’t sleep,

00:10:49.596 --> 00:10:53.396
you can’t turn those short-term
memories into long-term memories.

00:10:53.996 --> 00:10:56.396
And that’s why sleep
is so important for learning.

00:10:56.396 --> 00:10:59.116
That’s why pulling
an all-nighter and cramming

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:01.356
is the worst thing you can do for study

00:11:01.356 --> 00:11:05.316
because you are not going to retain
that information for the long term.

00:11:05.756 --> 00:11:07.516
So really, here's what you should do.

00:11:09.556 --> 00:11:12.236
Make sure you prioritize
your sleep before you study,

00:11:12.236 --> 00:11:13.996
just so you can be a bit more alert,

00:11:13.996 --> 00:11:17.556
but also really prioritize
that study after learning

00:11:17.556 --> 00:11:21.836
because you will need that to retain
that information for the long term.

00:11:25.316 --> 00:11:28.676
Now, the old adage says
that practice makes perfect,

00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:30.276
but there's so much truth to that

00:11:30.276 --> 00:11:34.196
because repetition is key
when it comes to learning.

00:11:34.716 --> 00:11:38.316
Repetition is key
when it comes to learning.

00:11:38.316 --> 00:11:41.036
It's not enough to just hear
or see something once

00:11:41.036 --> 00:11:42.956
and expect to remember it forever.

00:11:42.956 --> 00:11:44.956
Just like exercising builds muscle,

00:11:44.956 --> 00:11:50.476
repetitive patterns of thinking or doing
things will reinforce those pathways

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:53.956
and those connections in the brain
associated with doing that thing,

00:11:53.956 --> 00:11:56.396
so it'll become easier to recall.

00:11:56.396 --> 00:12:00.636
So through the process of neuroplasticity,
you’re making these brand-new connections.

00:12:01.276 --> 00:12:04.756
And that takes energy,
requires fatty acids,

00:12:04.916 --> 00:12:07.236
requires lots of little
proteins to be made.

00:12:07.676 --> 00:12:09.636
It’s a big job. It takes a lot of energy.

00:12:09.836 --> 00:12:12.756
And the brain’s not going
to want to invest all of this energy

00:12:12.756 --> 00:12:14.556
in creating these new connections

00:12:14.556 --> 00:12:18.116
if it’s something that
you’ve only done once, right?

00:12:18.116 --> 00:12:21.476
That is why repetition
is so important for learning.

00:12:21.956 --> 00:12:24.956
It’s basically flagging to your brain
at the cellular level that

00:12:24.956 --> 00:12:27.636
“Hey, this is the thing that 
keeps coming up in my life.

00:12:27.636 --> 00:12:29.236
So in order to be more efficient,

00:12:29.236 --> 00:12:31.516
I need to reinforce this
and do it better.”

00:12:31.636 --> 00:12:33.396
So here's what you should do.

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:38.116
Repeat the thing that you are trying
to learn as many times as you can

00:12:38.116 --> 00:12:41.516
in that learning period,
and use the spacing technique.

00:12:41.516 --> 00:12:44.796
So space your learning out
over multiple days

00:12:45.236 --> 00:12:50.236
so that way your learning has a chance
to build on those new long-term memories.

00:12:54.156 --> 00:12:57.796
We know that two shorter
learning periods over different days

00:12:57.796 --> 00:13:00.716
will result in significantly
better learning

00:13:00.716 --> 00:13:03.596
than using that same amount
of time on a single day.

00:13:06.996 --> 00:13:10.796
Sometimes we can learn things in one go.

00:13:10.796 --> 00:13:15.236
And this is a thing called “one-trial
learning” in psychology and neuroscience.

00:13:15.396 --> 00:13:18.996
And it basically happens when there’s
a really strong emotional component

00:13:18.996 --> 00:13:20.716
tied to that experience.

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:24.476
So, for example, if it makes us really
happy or really sad or scared,

00:13:24.476 --> 00:13:26.996
especially if it makes
us afraid, actually,

00:13:26.996 --> 00:13:29.716
and there’s a really important
biological reason for that

00:13:29.716 --> 00:13:31.116
if you think about it.

00:13:31.116 --> 00:13:35.916
So your brain wants
to remember in exquisite detail

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:38.396
everything to do with that scary event.

00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:41.956
So that way, you know how to respond
the next time you encounter it

00:13:41.956 --> 00:13:44.076
or just so you can avoid it completely.

00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:46.676
And when things go wrong
with that process,

00:13:46.676 --> 00:13:49.276
you can end up with things like PTSD.

00:13:53.236 --> 00:13:55.836
Breaks are incredibly important
for learning as well.

00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:58.156
And there are two main reasons for that.

00:13:58.196 --> 00:14:02.636
So, first of all, it gives our brains
a chance to replay that information.

00:14:02.636 --> 00:14:04.476
It happens completely subconsciously.

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:07.396
So, for example, if you were learning
a sequence on the piano,

00:14:08.116 --> 00:14:10.956
then if you were to take
a ten-second break afterwards,

00:14:11.156 --> 00:14:13.476
your brain will actually
be brain recording

00:14:13.476 --> 00:14:17.556
so that you’ll be replaying that sequence,
and you’ll be doing it 20 times faster.

00:14:17.876 --> 00:14:23.396
And it looks like it might be even better
if you spend 10 to 20 minutes afterwards

00:14:24.076 --> 00:14:27.756
either just having a quiet break -
no phones, of course -

00:14:28.236 --> 00:14:31.796
having a nap or doing a round
of nonsleep, deep rest.

00:14:31.916 --> 00:14:34.596
Now, the other reason
why breaks are important is because

00:14:34.596 --> 00:14:38.076
that newly encoded information
isn’t very stable.

00:14:38.556 --> 00:14:44.916
And if you were to use those same networks
to learn something else soon afterwards,

00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:48.716
what will happen is that newly encoded
information can be destroyed

00:14:48.716 --> 00:14:51.796
in a process called
“retrograde interference.”

00:14:51.796 --> 00:14:55.636
And in kids, they stabilize
pretty quickly, within a few minutes.

00:14:55.636 --> 00:15:00.276
But in adults, as far as we know,
they’re still unstable after an hour,

00:15:00.276 --> 00:15:01.596
maybe longer.

00:15:01.596 --> 00:15:03.076
So here’s what you should do.

00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:06.636
Make sure you take a 10- to 20-minute
break after you finish learning.

00:15:06.636 --> 00:15:08.116
And if you're at work, well,

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:12.836
then just try and do those mundane tasks
that you can do without thinking too much

00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:17.116
and wait at least an hour
before trying to learn something similar,

00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:19.156
preferably do it on a different day.

00:15:19.156 --> 00:15:20.396
Next, we have mistakes,

00:15:20.396 --> 00:15:22.836
and I know making mistakes is terrifying.

00:15:22.836 --> 00:15:26.036
It is really scary, but there’s
a biological reason behind that.

00:15:26.036 --> 00:15:30.796
So that feeling of anxiety and stress
you get when you make a mistake,

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.916
it serves a really important purpose.

00:15:33.116 --> 00:15:34.716
So when you make a mistake,

00:15:34.716 --> 00:15:37.956
what happens is you’re releasing
neuromodulators like acetylcholine,

00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:42.036
and you're getting increased activity
in your focused attention networks.

00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:46.916
And that increase in attention
and that feeling of anxiety

00:15:46.916 --> 00:15:48.796
serves a really important purpose.

00:15:49.036 --> 00:15:52.316
It’s basically saying to us,
“Hey, you made a mistake.

00:15:52.316 --> 00:15:55.196
You need to change and do better
and become more efficient.”

00:15:55.196 --> 00:15:58.116
And it's opening up this window
for neuroplasticity.

00:15:58.116 --> 00:16:02.356
So, whatever happens next,
your brain is ready to take in.

00:16:02.356 --> 00:16:06.476
Now, if you make a mistake and you feel
a bit anxious, and you walk away,

00:16:06.476 --> 00:16:08.716
well, ‘A’, you’re not going
to learn that thing,

00:16:08.716 --> 00:16:13.996
and ‘B’, well, you’re actually learning
to be less able to cope with failure.

00:16:14.236 --> 00:16:15.476
Here’s what you should do.

00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:18.396
You should set yourself up
for a little bit of failure, right?

00:16:18.396 --> 00:16:22.116
Quiz yourself on that topic as you go.
Don’t wait until you’re ready.

00:16:22.116 --> 00:16:24.636
If you’re learning something -
for example, soccer -

00:16:24.636 --> 00:16:26.876
don’t just kick it straight at the goal.

00:16:26.876 --> 00:16:29.836
Change the angle. Make it
more difficult, so you make mistakes.

00:16:29.836 --> 00:16:33.356
Don't wait for everything to be
perfect before you have a go,

00:16:33.676 --> 00:16:36.156
because at the end of the day
if you make a mistake,

00:16:36.156 --> 00:16:39.156
you'll be releasing neuromodulators
that improve your attention.

00:16:39.876 --> 00:16:41.156
And if you get it right,

00:16:41.156 --> 00:16:44.996
you’ll be releasing things
like dopamine in your reward circuits,

00:16:44.996 --> 00:16:46.396
which makes you feel good,

00:16:47.116 --> 00:16:48.956
which makes you feel more motivated

00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:52.876
and consolidates the learning of the thing
that you just did correctly, right?

00:16:52.876 --> 00:16:56.556
So that’s why turning our learning
into a bit of a game can work so well.

00:16:56.556 --> 00:17:00.516
It’s a bit of a win-win situation
for our brain either way, right?

00:17:00.676 --> 00:17:05.316
So when you make a mistake, you know,
don't view that anxiety as a bad thing.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.196
Lean into that feeling and keep going

00:17:07.196 --> 00:17:10.396
because it's really your brain's way
of helping you be your best.

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:14.276
It’s helping you be better
than the person that you were yesterday.

00:17:16.356 --> 00:17:19.836
So, as you can see, I’m not angry anymore.

00:17:20.436 --> 00:17:22.036
I’m still quite nervous.

00:17:22.036 --> 00:17:23.516
(Laughter)

00:17:25.076 --> 00:17:27.556
But that’s because
by understanding the brain,

00:17:27.556 --> 00:17:31.796
I know that you have the keys
to unlock your potential to learn faster

00:17:31.796 --> 00:17:32.956
and more effectively.

00:17:33.076 --> 00:17:39.516
Those keys are attention, alertness,
sleep, repetition, breaks, and mistakes.

00:17:39.996 --> 00:17:41.996
So next time you’re sitting down to learn,

00:17:41.996 --> 00:17:45.436
get rid of those distractions,
increase your attention,

00:17:45.436 --> 00:17:48.516
increase your alertness,
maybe through a little bit of exercise,

00:17:48.796 --> 00:17:52.436
repeat the thing that you are trying
to do as many times as you can

00:17:52.476 --> 00:17:56.196
in that training period,
and repeat it over multiple days,

00:17:56.196 --> 00:18:00.156
making sure that you prioritize
that sleep in between.

00:18:01.156 --> 00:18:02.716
Embrace your mistakes,

00:18:02.716 --> 00:18:06.036
and make sure you take
a 10- to 20-minute break after learning

00:18:06.036 --> 00:18:07.956
because your brain
is going to thank you.

00:18:09.036 --> 00:18:11.396
And now I’m going to thank you
for your attention,

00:18:11.396 --> 00:18:13.116
and I hope you learnt something new.

00:18:13.116 --> 00:18:16.116
(Applause)
