0.09,2.062,I think we should describe everyone's situation first.
2.062,3.404,"Well, I just don't want anybody to leave"
3.404,5.165,"with their feelings hurt or feeling like,"
5.165,6.869,my problems aren't big enough and I feel ashamed
6.869,7.77,"for talking about what I have to deal with."""
7.77,9.461,"Well, no one will feel like that."
9.461,10.832,"Well, you don't know that though!"
24.515,25.434,Hi you guys.
25.434,26.764,Hi!
26.764,28.476,What do you guys all have in common?
28.476,31.309,We're in high school.
32.184,33.514,What's high school like right now?
33.514,34.642,It's hell!
34.642,35.642,Yeah!
36.705,37.886,It's a fucking prison! Holy shit.
39.196,40.745,The game is 1000 to one.
40.745,42.796,You decide who leaves with a 1000 dollars.
42.796,44.654,We're going to do four elimination rounds.
44.654,47.985,"If you cannot decide, nobody gets the money."
47.985,49.686,Round one! Begins!
49.686,51.286,I think we should describe everyone's situation first
51.286,52.428,very briefly.
52.428,53.698,Because we do not have a lot of time.
53.698,55.016,"We could do it that way, or we could do like,"
55.016,56.176,We have competitions and then--
56.176,57.696,I feel like competitions isn't the best idea because--
57.696,58.772,"Well, I just don't want anybody to leave"
58.772,60.23,"with their feelings hurt or feeling like,"
60.23,61.55,"""My problems aren't big enough,"
61.55,62.99,"""and I feel ashamed for talking about"
62.99,63.823,"""what I have to deal with."""
63.823,64.656,"Well, no one will feel like that."
64.656,65.592,"Well, you don't know that though!"
65.592,67.922,If somebody says super personal they wish they hadn't said
67.922,69.496,"'cause they didn't end up getting the money,"
69.496,70.521,"and it didn't help them, you know?"
70.521,71.671,"That could feel like, really bad,"
71.671,73.324,or people could feel ashamed about their problems.
73.324,74.157,"Or like, ""My problems aren't as big"
74.157,75.044,"""as somebody else's problems!"""
75.044,76.81,"I just don't want anybody to be like,"
76.81,79.367,"""Oh man, my life sucks but I didn't get the money!"""
79.367,80.665,"Because we're on a timer,"
80.665,81.615,"I feel like we should just like,"
81.615,83.963,"have someone like, say why they need the 1000 dollars."
83.963,86.215,"And in the end, we can just all collectively..."
86.215,87.048,Okay.
87.048,87.881,Say our thoughts.
87.881,90.69,What I would do with the 1000 is help start
90.69,92.04,an online clothing business.
92.04,94.249,What kind of clothing will you be selling?
94.249,98.679,"Just, like, t-shirts and more like street-wear oriented."
98.679,100.311,I don't know like music artists...
100.311,102.303,Something to do with like pop culture.
102.303,105.881,I want the 1000 dollars for my education.
105.881,109.521,"I'm in full IB, so for each test that you take,"
109.521,111.532,you have to pay a certain amount.
111.532,113.04,"I'm a senior right now,"
113.04,116.041,and I just wanna put the money towards college.
116.041,118.617,"And being able to afford, like textbooks"
118.617,120.914,"and college tuition, so..."
120.914,122.623,"Well, obviously I easily could've taken my girl out,"
122.623,124.503,or get a Gucci belt or something but...
124.503,126.133,"This is a real man right here, okay?"
126.133,129.461,"Actually, I'm taking a like couple classes"
129.461,132.918,"in my high school that has college credit towards it,"
132.918,135.517,and it's like a good 600 dollars.
135.517,137.627,"I need the other 400 because my sister, like,"
137.627,140.797,"handed me down her car but, like, it's beat up."
140.797,143.339,I needed money to fix that.
143.339,145.857,"So most of my money goes to like, paying my car insurance"
145.857,147.458,"and my like, school fees."
147.458,150.154,"And then on top of that, I got invited to a wedding Florida."
150.154,151.373,Whatever I had left over;
151.373,152.807,"I tried to get a good plane ticket over there,"
152.807,154.026,so I could be at the wedding!
154.026,156.397,I want to be a marine biologist when I grow up.
156.397,158.605,"I love the ocean, I love animals."
158.605,160.757,"It's just where I get my happiness from, really."
160.757,163.214,"There's this trip to the Bahamas,"
163.214,164.574,"which is very, very expensive,"
164.574,166.845,and a 1000 dollars would help me go to that.
166.845,168.637,I feel like it would be a super cool experience.
168.637,170.266,Is it like a trip through your school? Or like--
170.266,171.099,No.
171.099,173.12,So just a personal interest thing? Right?
173.12,174.154,Yeah.
174.154,175.247,"In my current home,"
175.247,178.132,"I'm pretty much left to fund myself, basically."
178.132,180.701,"And it really sucks because the school that I go to,"
180.701,183.954,"they don't supply buses to my house area,"
183.954,186.333,"so I have to take Ubers like, everywhere."
186.333,187.344,And it's like...
187.344,188.177,That's expensive.
188.177,189.01,Yeah.
189.01,190.053,It's like a lot of stress on me.
190.053,191.314,And it's like...
191.314,193.144,"I'm sorry, I'm getting emotional."
193.144,195.914,"It's like I'm being forced to grow up so fast,"
195.914,197.247,and I'm only 16.
199.035,201.492,"Nina, were you the one that said we shouldn't do"
201.492,203.045,what we just did?
203.045,204.488,Yes.
204.488,205.722,Why?
205.722,206.555,I don't know.
206.555,207.388,It can make people feel like
207.388,208.221,their reasons aren't good enough.
208.221,209.402,"Or automatically make people feel like,"
209.402,211.224,"""We should give her the money!"""
211.224,212.161,"Or, ""Give him the money!"""
212.161,213.562,For this reason or that reason.
213.562,215.946,"And not to say that isn't valid,"
215.946,217.422,but everybody else is also valid.
217.422,220.085,"And so I think if we decided to do a random competition,"
220.085,222.365,that's a way that nobody can feel attacked
222.365,224.114,or feel hurt by specific people.
224.114,225.742,"I feel the opposite, personally."
225.742,227.504,Because I just feel like we should give it to the person
227.504,229.405,who needs it and who deserves it.
229.405,232.224,Because if she's working really hard
232.224,234.544,"and she's trying to just get through school,"
234.544,237.154,that's a bigger than buying a plane ticket
237.154,238.354,or going on a trip.
238.354,239.293,Or something like that.
239.293,240.954,"I don't want it to seem like coming off as,"
240.954,242.354,"""Oh, I'm using that as a pity--"""
242.354,243.931,No!
243.931,245.205,That's like your reason!
245.205,246.424,I don't want anybody to feel bad.
246.424,247.794,I don't feel comfortable talking about the stuff
247.794,249.906,I have going on at home that would make a difference.
249.906,251.225,"Like, I know we all have stuff going on"
251.225,252.058,that we didn't bring up.
252.058,254.665,You have a minute and 10 seconds.
254.665,255.498,Okay.
255.498,256.688,"Guys, we need to like..."
256.688,257.528,We need to vote!
257.528,259.88,"Okay, this is one vote for Jordyn--"
259.88,260.713,Me.
260.713,262.271,Eshel...
262.271,263.673,Who's that?
263.673,265.49,Who wrote that?
265.49,268.342,"Me. I don't know how to spell his name, I'm sorry."
268.342,269.175,Just say NJ.
269.175,270.038,His name is NJ.
270.038,270.871,NJ!
270.871,271.777,One for Kalid.
271.777,273.044,Obviously.
273.044,274.885,One for Nina.
274.885,276.594,Another one for Kalid.
276.594,277.855,Another one for me.
277.855,279.859,And one for EJ.
279.859,281.031,So there's a tie?
281.031,281.872,Yeah.
281.872,282.705,How do you guys want to do it?
282.705,283.538,Vote again?
283.538,284.453,Or do you want them to decide?
284.453,285.573,Just vote.
285.573,286.503,Just vote. Just vote.
286.503,287.605,Just vote.
287.605,289.937,"I know I'm gonna be out, so just vote."
289.937,290.883,Why?
290.883,293.384,"Because. I don't know, everyone has something against me."
293.384,294.217,So...
294.217,295.863,I don't have anything against you.
295.863,296.984,"See, this is what I didn't want to happen."
296.984,298.304,If somebody gets hurt by what's happening--
298.304,299.376,I'm not hurt!
299.376,300.209,"Well, but you're saying like,"
300.209,301.118,"""Everybody has something against me!"""
301.118,302.387,"So if we just did random competitions,"
302.387,303.587,nobody would feel that way.
303.587,304.42,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
304.42,307.227,"I have one for Kalid, one for Jordyn,"
307.227,311.274,"two for Kalid, three for Kalid, and one for Jordyn."
311.274,312.515,"Sorry, Kalid."
312.515,313.411,"So, its three to two."
313.411,315.394,Sorry.
315.394,317.442,How's everybody doing?
317.442,318.671,It was a lot.
318.671,319.561,That was emotional.
319.561,320.97,That was deep!
320.97,322.0,Are you okay?
322.0,324.44,"Yeah. I mean, I kinda expected it."
324.44,325.642,"I mean, going into this"
325.642,328.272,I kind of expected to be the first one out.
328.272,329.105,Aw.
329.105,331.474,"So, I have nothing against any of you."
331.474,332.307,You guys ready?
332.307,333.14,Yes.
333.14,334.477,"All right, we've started."
334.477,335.534,"I feel like we should do something fun, you know?"
335.534,336.597,Something to bring up the mood.
336.597,337.725,I think we should just do random stuff.
337.725,340.165,"Like who can name the most countries in Europe,"
340.165,341.546,who can stand on one foot the longest.
341.546,342.379,I'm just saying random stuff.
342.379,345.304,Maybe who can stand on one foot the longest maybe?
345.304,346.517,Should we do that? One leg standing up--
346.517,348.2,First one fallen out?
348.2,349.033,Sure!
349.033,351.595,Ooh! That's-- Shoes coming off!
351.595,353.911,"Three, two, one. Foot up."
356.248,357.497,Couch.
361.263,363.063,"I'm Buddhist, everybody, so I do this like 10 times a day."
363.063,364.697,How about you do challenges?
364.697,366.569,To throw you guys off?
366.569,368.708,How about you guys have to spin around?
368.708,370.53,This feels easier!
370.53,371.697,This is so--
372.655,375.34,Is there anything else we could do?
375.34,376.831,"How about you stop,"
376.831,379.572,since I don't know if you guys are dizzy.
379.572,380.405,I'm out.
382.336,383.169,Are you out?
383.169,384.482,I'm out.
384.482,385.406,How do you feel?
385.406,386.819,Do you think that was fair? Doing the...
386.819,388.28,No.
388.28,389.4,Did you say no?
389.4,390.741,"No, it's not fair!"
390.741,392.712,"I don't think anybody had, like, an upper-hand in that."
392.712,393.866,I'ma be hella mean.
393.866,395.255,I'm gonna be so mean.
395.255,396.425,Whoa!
396.425,397.581,Okay. Drama!
397.581,398.461,Lets make it interesting.
398.461,400.594,"So we're not gonna listen to the couch, right guys?"
400.594,402.079,Who's the leader here?
402.079,403.45,Nina.
403.45,404.791,I feel like it's the three of us.
404.791,405.861,Nina.
405.861,406.694,Nina!
406.694,407.686,Nina!
407.686,408.936,Are you hearing the couch?
408.936,410.485,"Yeah, I hear it very well."
410.485,411.318,Yeah.
412.651,413.843,Well I think you're saying that
413.843,415.527,"because in the very beginning, I was like,"
415.527,417.504,"""Let's do challenges."""
417.504,418.943,"No, I'm not saying that because of that."
418.943,420.702,You keep influencing everyone.
420.702,421.535,How?
421.535,422.685,How am I influencing people?
422.685,425.265,I think she's just trying to make everything work.
425.265,426.496,Is it cool if we just stop getting input
426.496,427.558,from the couch for a little bit?
427.558,430.663,'Cause this is between-- in conclusion of us five.
430.663,431.798,Do people agree?
431.798,432.631,That's a fair point.
432.631,433.464,I agree.
433.464,434.297,Yeah.
434.297,435.236,"Okay. Are we starting the next round yet, or not yet?"
435.236,437.418,I'm gonna start it now.
437.418,439.063,"What was your reasoning again, NJ?"
439.063,441.751,Pay for my IB testing.
441.751,443.111,"EJ, what about you?"
443.111,445.429,What are you gonna do with the money for your girlfriend?
445.429,447.991,I was gonna take her out probably to a nice dinner.
447.991,450.471,She has like some car insurance that she needs to pay off.
450.471,452.17,"So, I would help her with that."
452.17,453.83,"If he needs it for his girlfriend,"
453.83,456.53,then I think his girlfriend would've been a better candidate
456.53,457.551,to come on the set.
457.551,460.031,"But that's the thing, like, that wasn't my reason."
460.031,461.322,My reason was--
461.322,462.41,"School fees, right?"
462.41,464.781,"It's a lot deeper than what I said,"
464.781,465.73,but I don't want to get into it.
465.73,466.842,"Yeah, same."
466.842,467.675,I understand.
467.675,468.696,"I have to pay for school stuff,"
468.696,470.232,but the reasoning underneath that
470.232,471.983,is that my family also can't pay for it.
471.983,472.816,And it's stuff that I...
472.816,474.002,"Like, nobody knows."
474.002,475.547,And I'm not allowed to talk about.
475.547,478.946,"So I literally, even though I want to use it as a reason,"
478.946,481.424,"because it is valid, like, I can't."
481.424,483.096,"So, can we think of anything else we can do that's like--"
483.096,484.703,"Honestly, just vote someone out!"
484.703,485.758,"Red light, green light!"
485.758,487.398,"Red light, green light!"
487.398,488.638,"What can we do, EJ?"
488.638,489.888,"Shit, I don't know."
491.198,494.006,"You wanna do something physical, something like a quiz?"
494.006,494.918,That quiz sounds pretty...
494.918,496.518,"Yeah, we can do like a quiz on--"
496.518,498.267,Can I quiz you on ocean facts?
498.267,499.605,Ocean facts!
499.605,500.742,What about writing down in the bowl
500.742,501.576,like we did in the first round?
501.576,502.409,You wanna do that?
502.409,503.336,Writing down what?
503.336,504.307,We can do that! Yeah!
504.307,505.838,Based off of what? You know?
505.838,507.174,Just like how we feel.
507.174,509.427,Just in general? Okay.
511.744,513.353,NJ.
513.353,514.186,NJ.
514.186,515.019,"No, that's--"
515.019,515.852,"Oh, that's EJ. Sorry."
515.852,516.886,"Oh, that's confusing."
516.886,517.719,Yeah.
517.719,518.59,NJ.
518.59,519.499,EJ.
519.499,520.402,What?
520.402,521.485,Oh my gosh.
522.485,523.318,EJ.
523.318,524.612,"Oh, man."
524.612,525.921,All right.
525.921,526.754,You were really nice.
526.754,528.209,I really liked you.
528.209,529.927,EJ! Come join us!
529.927,530.986,"Okay, not to be weird but like--"
530.986,531.857,Asian gang!
531.857,533.007,Asian gang!
533.007,534.585,How you doing?
534.585,538.054,"It sucks! It does, like I'm not 'finna cap."
538.054,538.915,It sucks.
538.915,540.715,"But, they chose."
540.715,542.288,Are you guys ready?
542.288,544.397,"Think of something fun, creative, outside of the box,"
544.397,545.307,that we can--
545.307,546.747,How about the drawing contest?
546.747,548.086,"All right, let's have a drawing contest then!"
548.086,550.026,And then are we voting? Or who's voting?
550.026,551.075,Let's have the couch vote.
551.075,552.526,"No, because they have their preferences."
552.526,555.539,"No, but you shuffle it so we don't know who's it is."
555.539,556.479,Oh!
556.479,557.312,That's a good idea.
557.312,558.145,"Yeah, let's do that!"
558.145,558.978,Okay that's fair.
558.978,559.811,"Wait, what are we gonna draw?"
559.811,560.644,Let them decide.
560.644,562.281,"Draw, like, an octopus."
562.281,563.276,Okay!
565.085,568.613,God dang it! I messed up already!
568.613,571.522,"You guys wanna play like, rock, paper, scissors together?"
572.402,573.235,I'm chilling.
573.235,576.042,"This is also probably how like, children would decide."
576.042,577.874,We're literally children.
577.874,581.213,This is gonna be the best damn octopus I've ever drawn.
581.213,583.533,"So, how's your girlfriend?"
583.533,585.306,"Oh, come on, dog."
585.306,586.615,Are we done? Are we ready?
586.615,587.615,I'm ready.
589.685,591.175,"Okay, this one."
591.175,592.284,That's cute!
592.284,595.654,It has little blush and little kawaii cheeks.
595.654,597.737,Ollie the Octo is hungry.
599.034,599.867,The oct--
599.867,601.064,The next octopus--
601.064,602.466,"To be honest, it's a little scary."
602.466,603.574,The eyes are like--
603.574,604.885,To be honest it's really--
604.885,605.718,It's kinda creeping me out.
605.718,606.626,And then this one.
606.626,609.485,It's another little creepy one.
609.485,610.906,"No, it's all right."
610.906,613.186,"Actually, the eyes are kind of on point though."
613.186,614.285,'Cause they do kinda come out.
614.285,616.034,So the one that we picked--
616.034,616.874,I already see it.
616.874,620.329,"For the loser, is the scary one."
620.329,622.193,Okay. I'm out!
622.193,624.981,Aw! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.
624.981,626.233,I feel really bad.
626.233,627.262,"Hi, guys!"
627.262,628.662,"I have a stomachache, oh my god."
628.662,630.257,How do you guys feel about that?
630.257,631.476,Like how we did that last voting?
631.476,632.746,I liked it.
632.746,634.665,But I also didn't like it.
636.248,637.081,It was fair.
637.081,638.506,You guys think this round was more fair
638.506,639.517,than the previous rounds?
639.517,640.881,"Yeah, for sure."
640.881,642.076,Did you want me out?
642.076,642.909,Did you want me out?
642.909,643.742,No!
643.742,646.859,"Actually, most of the people that I want in the final three"
646.859,649.548,"are there, but just like, not all of them."
649.548,650.512,What'd you say?
650.512,652.091,I said most of the people on the couch right now
652.091,654.083,are what I wanted on the final three.
654.083,655.558,Aw!
655.558,656.391,Most.
656.391,657.397,Most.
657.397,658.23,Most?
658.23,660.343,One of you aren't my favorite.
660.343,661.645,I'm going to start this final round.
661.645,664.171,You have to decide who's the one person
664.171,666.269,that leaves with the money.
666.269,667.102,What were you going to say?
667.102,668.461,I feel like we should...
668.461,669.571,For this last round we should like...
669.571,671.701,"You know, obviously state our opinions."
671.701,673.71,You guys want our opinions? Or no?
673.71,674.543,No?
675.848,677.669,"As long as we don't know if they're singling one of us out,"
677.669,679.179,or something then I think that's fair.
679.179,680.328,"Okay, yeah. We'll hear it. Sure."
680.328,681.828,I'd say Heather.
682.677,685.699,"I don't know, you just like, have an impact on me."
685.699,687.538,"Yeah, what do you think, EJ?"
687.538,690.037,"Uh, I would say Heather too."
690.037,691.497,"Don't take it as like, pity."
691.497,692.597,"Like, ""They're pitying me!"""
692.597,694.302,"It's like if you need it, you need it."
694.302,695.688,I would also say Heather.
695.688,698.078,I honestly think that she needs it.
698.078,702.911,"Earlier I said Heather, so I'm gonna keep that decision."
704.099,708.008,"Hearing everyone's opinion and everyone's stories,"
708.008,710.338,I cannot can compare myself
710.338,711.72,to what you two are going through.
711.72,714.982,I live in a city where there's a lot of things accessible.
714.982,716.19,"I have a job, you know?"
716.19,720.423,"I have great supporting parents, so I just want..."
720.423,722.334,I wanna vote myself off.
722.334,725.854,Just because you guys deserve a lot more than I do.
725.854,729.009,"I'm definitely going to vote but, it's gonna be kinda hard."
729.009,730.309,"So, I'm opting myself out!"
730.309,732.606,I'm just gonna sit over here.
732.606,733.867,"So like, specifically,"
733.867,734.856,what are you going to use the money for?
734.856,736.627,"'Cause I know you have like, a lot of stuff going on."
736.627,738.246,I would probably use really it for a car
738.246,741.526,because my main thing is transportation and getting around.
741.526,743.376,Because for school...
743.376,745.506,"That's like, for getting there, 10 bucks."
745.506,748.372,"For getting back, 10 bucks. For going to work, 10 bucks."
748.372,749.23,It's a lot of money.
749.23,750.063,Yeah.
750.063,750.896,Going straight to transportation
750.896,752.208,when I could be using it for better things.
752.208,753.368,Like for school.
753.368,754.779,How many hours do you work?
754.779,755.95,Upwards of 30.
755.95,757.248,"Okay, so you work like, a full job"
757.248,758.979,and then you also do school on top of that.
758.979,761.078,So you probably work that many hours because you have to.
761.078,761.911,"To pay for like,"
761.911,764.898,"for food, and your transportation, and stuff."
764.898,767.435,"I mean, I'm going to give it to Heather if you are."
767.435,768.268,I'm pretty cool with that.
768.268,769.336,Yeah. I'm totally fine.
769.336,771.675,I think we're going to give it to Heather.
771.675,773.835,I just feel really bad.
773.835,775.166,This is not pity thing.
775.166,777.246,"This is obviously a really big need, so."
777.246,778.079,Yeah.
778.079,778.912,Yeah!
778.912,779.745,We're set.
784.273,785.596,Can we do a group hug?
785.596,786.429,Yeah!
786.429,787.262,Can we all do a group hug?
787.262,788.262,Thank you!
789.929,791.967,How was this experience for you guys?
791.967,795.037,It was a lot more than I anticipated.
795.037,796.866,"Well, it's not an easy thing to do to be like,"
796.866,798.397,"""This is why I should get money,"
798.397,799.846,"""and none of you guys should get money."""
799.846,801.771,It's just like a weird situation to be in.
801.771,802.604,Yeah.
802.604,804.155,Did anything surprise you about your behavior today?
804.155,806.955,Yeah. I was really mean and I wasn't expecting that.
806.955,810.133,I had a lot of rage and I don't usually have that much rage.
810.133,811.795,"So, It kinda just surprised me."
811.795,815.485,I didn't know I'd be so vulnerable.
815.485,817.078,And like I'm not an emotional person.
817.078,818.729,"So like, it was a good thing."
818.729,819.838,"When you need something really bad,"
819.838,822.887,you're willing to sacrifice what you...
822.887,823.838,What you usually do.
823.838,825.339,I'd say.
829.787,830.62,Oh my god.
830.62,832.127,"Dinner is on me, you guys!"
832.127,834.608,McDonald's for everyone!
