00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.062
- I think we should describe
everyone's situation first.

00:00:02.062 --> 00:00:03.404
- Well, I just don't want anybody to leave

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:05.165
with their feelings hurt or feeling like,

00:00:05.165 --> 00:00:06.869
my problems aren't big
enough and I feel ashamed

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:07.770
for talking about what
I have to deal with."

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.461
- Well, no one will feel like that.

00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:10.832
- Well, you don't know that though!

00:00:10.832 --> 00:00:13.832
(suspenseful music)

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:25.434
- [Man] Hi you guys.

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:26.764
- [Students] Hi!

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:28.476
- [Man] What do you
guys all have in common?

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:31.309
- [Students] We're in high school.

00:00:32.184 --> 00:00:33.514
- [Man] What's high school like right now?

00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:34.642
- It's hell!

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:35.642
- Yeah!

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:36.705
(Laughter)

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:37.886
- It's a fucking prison! Holy shit.

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:39.196
(Laughter)

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:40.745
- [Man] The game is 1000 to one.

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.796
You decide who leaves with a 1000 dollars.

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:44.654
We're going to do four elimination rounds.

00:00:44.654 --> 00:00:47.985
If you cannot decide,
nobody gets the money.

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:49.686
Round one! Begins!

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:51.286
- I think we should describe
everyone's situation first

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:52.428
very briefly.

00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:53.698
Because we do not have a lot of time.

00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:55.016
- We could do it that
way, or we could do like,

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:56.176
We have competitions and then--

00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:57.696
- I feel like competitions
isn't the best idea because--

00:00:57.696 --> 00:00:58.772
- Well, I just don't want anybody to leave

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:00.230
with their feelings hurt or feeling like,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.550
"My problems aren't big enough,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.990
"and I feel ashamed for talking about

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.823
"what I have to deal with."

00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:04.656
- Well, no one will feel like that.

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:05.592
- Well, you don't know that though!

00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:07.922
- If somebody says super personal
they wish they hadn't said

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:09.496
'cause they didn't end
up getting the money,

00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:10.521
and it didn't help them, you know?

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:11.671
That could feel like, really bad,

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.324
or people could feel ashamed
about their problems.

00:01:13.324 --> 00:01:14.157
Or like, "My problems aren't as big

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.044
"as somebody else's problems!"

00:01:15.044 --> 00:01:16.810
I just don't want anybody to be like,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.367
"Oh man, my life sucks but
I didn't get the money!"

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:20.665
- Because we're on a timer,

00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:21.615
I feel like we should just like,

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:23.963
have someone like, say why
they need the 1000 dollars.

00:01:23.963 --> 00:01:26.215
And in the end, we can
just all collectively...

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:27.048
- Okay.

00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:27.881
- Say our thoughts.

00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:30.690
- What I would do with
the 1000 is help start

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.040
an online clothing business.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.249
- What kind of clothing
will you be selling?

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.679
- Just, like, t-shirts and
more like street-wear oriented.

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.311
I don't know like music artists...

00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:42.303
Something to do with like pop culture.

00:01:42.303 --> 00:01:45.881
- I want the 1000
dollars for my education.

00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:49.521
I'm in full IB, so for
each test that you take,

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:51.532
you have to pay a certain amount.

00:01:51.532 --> 00:01:53.040
- I'm a senior right now,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.041
and I just wanna put the
money towards college.

00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:58.617
And being able to afford, like textbooks

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:00.914
and college tuition, so...

00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:02.623
- Well, obviously I easily
could've taken my girl out,

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:04.503
or get a Gucci belt or something but...

00:02:04.503 --> 00:02:06.133
- This is a real man right here, okay?

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:09.461
- Actually, I'm taking
a like couple classes

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:12.918
in my high school that has
college credit towards it,

00:02:12.918 --> 00:02:15.517
and it's like a good 600 dollars.

00:02:15.517 --> 00:02:17.627
I need the other 400
because my sister, like,

00:02:17.627 --> 00:02:20.797
handed me down her car
but, like, it's beat up.

00:02:20.797 --> 00:02:23.339
I needed money to fix that.

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.857
- So most of my money goes to
like, paying my car insurance

00:02:25.857 --> 00:02:27.458
and my like, school fees.

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:30.154
And then on top of that, I got
invited to a wedding Florida.

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:31.373
Whatever I had left over;

00:02:31.373 --> 00:02:32.807
I tried to get a good
plane ticket over there,

00:02:32.807 --> 00:02:34.026
so I could be at the wedding!

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:36.397
- I want to be a marine
biologist when I grow up.

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:38.605
I love the ocean, I love animals.

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:40.757
It's just where I get my
happiness from, really.

00:02:40.757 --> 00:02:43.214
There's this trip to the Bahamas,

00:02:43.214 --> 00:02:44.574
which is very, very expensive,

00:02:44.574 --> 00:02:46.845
and a 1000 dollars would
help me go to that.

00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:48.637
I feel like it would be
a super cool experience.

00:02:48.637 --> 00:02:50.266
- Is it like a trip through
your school? Or like--

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:51.099
- No.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.120
- So just a personal
interest thing? Right?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.154
- Yeah.

00:02:54.154 --> 00:02:55.247
- In my current home,

00:02:55.247 --> 00:02:58.132
I'm pretty much left to
fund myself, basically.

00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:00.701
And it really sucks because
the school that I go to,

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.954
they don't supply buses to my house area,

00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:06.333
so I have to take Ubers like, everywhere.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:07.344
And it's like...

00:03:07.344 --> 00:03:08.177
- That's expensive.

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:09.010
- Yeah.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.053
It's like a lot of stress on me.

00:03:10.053 --> 00:03:11.314
And it's like...

00:03:11.314 --> 00:03:13.144
I'm sorry, I'm getting emotional.

00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:15.914
It's like I'm being
forced to grow up so fast,

00:03:15.914 --> 00:03:17.247
and I'm only 16.

00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:21.492
- [Man] Nina, were you the
one that said we shouldn't do

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:23.045
what we just did?

00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:24.488
- Yes.

00:03:24.488 --> 00:03:25.722
- [Man] Why?

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:26.555
- I don't know.

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:27.388
It can make people feel like

00:03:27.388 --> 00:03:28.221
their reasons aren't good enough.

00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:29.402
Or automatically make people feel like,

00:03:29.402 --> 00:03:31.224
"We should give her the money!"

00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:32.161
Or, "Give him the money!"

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:33.562
For this reason or that reason.

00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:35.946
And not to say that isn't valid,

00:03:35.946 --> 00:03:37.422
but everybody else is also valid.

00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:40.085
And so I think if we decided
to do a random competition,

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:42.365
that's a way that nobody can feel attacked

00:03:42.365 --> 00:03:44.114
or feel hurt by specific people.

00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:45.742
- I feel the opposite, personally.

00:03:45.742 --> 00:03:47.504
Because I just feel like we
should give it to the person

00:03:47.504 --> 00:03:49.405
who needs it and who deserves it.

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:52.224
Because if she's working really hard

00:03:52.224 --> 00:03:54.544
and she's trying to
just get through school,

00:03:54.544 --> 00:03:57.154
that's a bigger than buying a plane ticket

00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:58.354
or going on a trip.

00:03:58.354 --> 00:03:59.293
Or something like that.

00:03:59.293 --> 00:04:00.954
- I don't want it to
seem like coming off as,

00:04:00.954 --> 00:04:02.354
"Oh, I'm using that as a pity--"

00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:03.931
- [Students] No!

00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:05.205
- That's like your reason!

00:04:05.205 --> 00:04:06.424
I don't want anybody to feel bad.

00:04:06.424 --> 00:04:07.794
I don't feel comfortable
talking about the stuff

00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:09.906
I have going on at home that
would make a difference.

00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:11.225
Like, I know we all have stuff going on

00:04:11.225 --> 00:04:12.058
that we didn't bring up.

00:04:12.058 --> 00:04:14.665
- [Man] You have a minute and 10 seconds.

00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:15.498
- Okay.

00:04:15.498 --> 00:04:16.688
Guys, we need to like...

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:17.528
We need to vote!

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:19.880
- Okay, this is one vote for Jordyn--

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.713
Me.

00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:22.271
Eshel...

00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:23.673
Who's that?

00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:25.490
- [Man] Who wrote that?

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.342
- Me. I don't know how to
spell his name, I'm sorry.

00:04:28.342 --> 00:04:29.175
- Just say NJ.

00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:30.038
- His name is NJ.

00:04:30.038 --> 00:04:30.871
- NJ!

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:31.777
- One for Kalid.

00:04:31.777 --> 00:04:33.044
- Obviously.

00:04:33.044 --> 00:04:34.885
- One for Nina.

00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:36.594
Another one for Kalid.

00:04:36.594 --> 00:04:37.855
Another one for me.

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:39.859
And one for EJ.

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:41.031
- [Man] So there's a tie?

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:41.872
- Yeah.

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:42.705
- [Man] How do you guys want to do it?

00:04:42.705 --> 00:04:43.538
Vote again?

00:04:43.538 --> 00:04:44.453
Or do you want them to decide?

00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:45.573
- Just vote.

00:04:45.573 --> 00:04:46.503
- Just vote. Just vote.

00:04:46.503 --> 00:04:47.605
- Just vote.

00:04:47.605 --> 00:04:49.937
- I know I'm gonna be out, so just vote.

00:04:49.937 --> 00:04:50.883
- [Man] Why?

00:04:50.883 --> 00:04:53.384
- Because. I don't know, everyone
has something against me.

00:04:53.384 --> 00:04:54.217
So...

00:04:54.217 --> 00:04:55.863
- I don't have anything against you.

00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:56.984
- See, this is what I
didn't want to happen.

00:04:56.984 --> 00:04:58.304
If somebody gets hurt
by what's happening--

00:04:58.304 --> 00:04:59.376
- I'm not hurt!

00:04:59.376 --> 00:05:00.209
- Well, but you're saying like,

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:01.118
"Everybody has something against me!"

00:05:01.118 --> 00:05:02.387
So if we just did random competitions,

00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:03.587
nobody would feel that way.

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:04.420
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.227
- I have one for Kalid, one for Jordyn,

00:05:07.227 --> 00:05:11.274
two for Kalid, three for
Kalid, and one for Jordyn.

00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:12.515
- Sorry, Kalid.

00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:13.411
- So, its three to two.

00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:15.394
- [Students] Sorry.

00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:17.442
- [Man] How's everybody doing?

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:18.671
- It was a lot.

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:19.561
- That was emotional.

00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:20.970
- That was deep! (laughs)

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.000
- [Man] Are you okay?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.440
- Yeah. I mean, I kinda expected it.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.642
I mean, going into this

00:05:25.642 --> 00:05:28.272
I kind of expected to
be the first one out.

00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:29.105
- Aw.

00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:31.474
- So, I have nothing against any of you.

00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:32.307
- [Man] You guys ready?

00:05:32.307 --> 00:05:33.140
- [Students] Yes.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.477
- [Man] All right, we've started.

00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:35.534
- I feel like we should do
something fun, you know?

00:05:35.534 --> 00:05:36.597
Something to bring up the mood.

00:05:36.597 --> 00:05:37.725
- I think we should just do random stuff.

00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:40.165
Like who can name the
most countries in Europe,

00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:41.546
who can stand on one foot the longest.

00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:42.379
I'm just saying random stuff.

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.304
- Maybe who can stand on
one foot the longest maybe?

00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:46.517
- Should we do that? One leg standing up--

00:05:46.517 --> 00:05:48.200
First one fallen out?

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.033
- Sure!

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:51.595
- Ooh! That's-- Shoes coming off!

00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:53.911
- Three, two, one. Foot up.

00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:54.994
(intense music)

00:05:54.994 --> 00:05:56.248
(laughs)

00:05:56.248 --> 00:05:57.497
- Couch.

00:05:57.497 --> 00:05:59.580
(laughs)

00:06:01.263 --> 00:06:03.063
- I'm Buddhist, everybody, so
I do this like 10 times a day.

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:04.697
- How about you do challenges?

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.569
To throw you guys off?

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.708
How about you guys have to spin around?

00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:10.530
- This feels easier!

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.697
- This is so--

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:15.340
- Is there anything else we could do?

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.831
- How about you stop,

00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:19.572
since I don't know if you guys are dizzy.

00:06:19.572 --> 00:06:20.405
- I'm out.

00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:23.169
- Are you out?

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.482
- I'm out.

00:06:24.482 --> 00:06:25.406
- [Man] How do you feel?

00:06:25.406 --> 00:06:26.819
Do you think that was fair? Doing the...

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.280
- No.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.400
- Did you say no?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.741
- No, it's not fair!

00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:32.712
- I don't think anybody had,
like, an upper-hand in that.

00:06:32.712 --> 00:06:33.866
- I'ma be hella mean.

00:06:33.866 --> 00:06:35.255
I'm gonna be so mean.

00:06:35.255 --> 00:06:36.425
- [Students] Whoa!

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:37.581
- Okay. Drama!

00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:38.461
Lets make it interesting.

00:06:38.461 --> 00:06:40.594
- So we're not gonna listen
to the couch, right guys?

00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:42.079
- [Man] Who's the leader here?

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:43.450
- Nina.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.791
- I feel like it's the three of us.

00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:45.861
- Nina.

00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:46.694
Nina!

00:06:46.694 --> 00:06:47.686
Nina!

00:06:47.686 --> 00:06:48.936
- [Man] Are you hearing the couch?

00:06:48.936 --> 00:06:50.485
- Yeah, I hear it very well.

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:51.318
- Yeah.

00:06:51.318 --> 00:06:52.651
(laughs)

00:06:52.651 --> 00:06:53.843
- Well I think you're saying that

00:06:53.843 --> 00:06:55.527
because in the very beginning, I was like,

00:06:55.527 --> 00:06:57.504
"Let's do challenges."

00:06:57.504 --> 00:06:58.943
- No, I'm not saying that because of that.

00:06:58.943 --> 00:07:00.702
You keep influencing everyone.

00:07:00.702 --> 00:07:01.535
- How?

00:07:01.535 --> 00:07:02.685
How am I influencing people?

00:07:02.685 --> 00:07:05.265
- I think she's just trying
to make everything work.

00:07:05.265 --> 00:07:06.496
- Is it cool if we just stop getting input

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:07.558
from the couch for a little bit?

00:07:07.558 --> 00:07:10.663
'Cause this is between--
in conclusion of us five.

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:11.798
Do people agree?

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:12.631
- That's a fair point.

00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:13.464
- I agree.

00:07:13.464 --> 00:07:14.297
- Yeah.

00:07:14.297 --> 00:07:15.236
- Okay. Are we starting the
next round yet, or not yet?

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:17.418
- [Man] I'm gonna start it now.

00:07:17.418 --> 00:07:19.063
- What was your reasoning again, NJ?

00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:21.751
- Pay for my IB testing.

00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:23.111
- EJ, what about you?

00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:25.429
What are you gonna do with
the money for your girlfriend?

00:07:25.429 --> 00:07:27.991
- I was gonna take her out
probably to a nice dinner.

00:07:27.991 --> 00:07:30.471
She has like some car insurance
that she needs to pay off.

00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:32.170
So, I would help her with that.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.830
- If he needs it for his girlfriend,

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.530
then I think his girlfriend
would've been a better candidate

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.551
to come on the set.

00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:40.031
- But that's the thing,
like, that wasn't my reason.

00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:41.322
My reason was--

00:07:41.322 --> 00:07:42.410
- School fees, right?

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.781
- It's a lot deeper than what I said,

00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:45.730
but I don't want to get into it.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.842
- Yeah, same.

00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:47.675
- I understand.

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:48.696
- I have to pay for school stuff,

00:07:48.696 --> 00:07:50.232
but the reasoning underneath that

00:07:50.232 --> 00:07:51.983
is that my family also can't pay for it.

00:07:51.983 --> 00:07:52.816
And it's stuff that I...

00:07:52.816 --> 00:07:54.002
Like, nobody knows.

00:07:54.002 --> 00:07:55.547
And I'm not allowed to talk about.

00:07:55.547 --> 00:07:58.946
So I literally, even though
I want to use it as a reason,

00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:01.424
because it is valid, like, I can't.

00:08:01.424 --> 00:08:03.096
- So, can we think of anything
else we can do that's like--

00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:04.703
- Honestly, just vote someone out!

00:08:04.703 --> 00:08:05.758
- Red light, green light!

00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:07.398
- Red light, green light!

00:08:07.398 --> 00:08:08.638
- What can we do, EJ?

00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:09.888
- Shit, I don't know.

00:08:09.888 --> 00:08:11.198
- [Students] (laughter)

00:08:11.198 --> 00:08:14.006
- You wanna do something
physical, something like a quiz?

00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:14.918
- That quiz sounds pretty...

00:08:14.918 --> 00:08:16.518
- Yeah, we can do like a quiz on--

00:08:16.518 --> 00:08:18.267
- Can I quiz you on ocean facts?

00:08:18.267 --> 00:08:19.605
- Ocean facts!

00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:20.742
- What about writing down in the bowl

00:08:20.742 --> 00:08:21.576
like we did in the first round?

00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:22.409
- You wanna do that?

00:08:22.409 --> 00:08:23.336
- Writing down what?

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.307
- We can do that! Yeah!

00:08:24.307 --> 00:08:25.838
- Based off of what? You know?

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.174
- Just like how we feel.

00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:29.427
- Just in general? Okay.

00:08:29.427 --> 00:08:31.744
(pen noise)

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:33.353
- NJ.

00:08:33.353 --> 00:08:34.186
NJ.

00:08:34.186 --> 00:08:35.019
- No, that's--

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:35.852
- Oh, that's EJ. Sorry.

00:08:35.852 --> 00:08:36.886
- Oh, that's confusing.

00:08:36.886 --> 00:08:37.719
- Yeah.

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:38.590
- NJ.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.499
EJ.

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:40.402
- What?

00:08:40.402 --> 00:08:41.485
- Oh my gosh.

00:08:42.485 --> 00:08:43.318
- EJ.

00:08:43.318 --> 00:08:44.612
Oh, man.

00:08:44.612 --> 00:08:45.921
- All right.

00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:46.754
- You were really nice.

00:08:46.754 --> 00:08:48.209
I really liked you.

00:08:48.209 --> 00:08:49.927
- EJ! Come join us!

00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:50.986
- Okay, not to be weird but like--

00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:51.857
Asian gang!

00:08:51.857 --> 00:08:53.007
- Asian gang!

00:08:53.007 --> 00:08:54.585
- [Man] How you doing?

00:08:54.585 --> 00:08:58.054
- It sucks! It does,
like I'm not 'finna cap.

00:08:58.054 --> 00:08:58.915
It sucks.

00:08:58.915 --> 00:09:00.715
But, they chose.

00:09:00.715 --> 00:09:02.288
- [Man] Are you guys ready?

00:09:02.288 --> 00:09:04.397
- Think of something fun,
creative, outside of the box,

00:09:04.397 --> 00:09:05.307
that we can--

00:09:05.307 --> 00:09:06.747
- How about the drawing contest?

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:08.086
- All right, let's have
a drawing contest then!

00:09:08.086 --> 00:09:10.026
- And then are we voting? Or who's voting?

00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:11.075
- Let's have the couch vote.

00:09:11.075 --> 00:09:12.526
- No, because they have their preferences.

00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:15.539
- No, but you shuffle it so
we don't know who's it is.

00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:16.479
- [Students] Oh!

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:17.312
- That's a good idea.

00:09:17.312 --> 00:09:18.145
- Yeah, let's do that!

00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:18.978
- Okay that's fair.

00:09:18.978 --> 00:09:19.811
- Wait, what are we gonna draw?

00:09:19.811 --> 00:09:20.644
- Let them decide.

00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:22.281
- Draw, like, an octopus.

00:09:22.281 --> 00:09:23.276
- Okay!

00:09:23.276 --> 00:09:25.085
(intense music)

00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:28.613
- God dang it! I messed up already!

00:09:28.613 --> 00:09:31.522
- You guys wanna play like,
rock, paper, scissors together?

00:09:31.522 --> 00:09:32.402
(laughs)

00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:33.235
- I'm chilling.

00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:36.042
- This is also probably how
like, children would decide.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.874
- We're literally children.

00:09:37.874 --> 00:09:41.213
- This is gonna be the best
damn octopus I've ever drawn.

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:43.533
- So, how's your girlfriend?

00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:45.306
- Oh, come on, dog.

00:09:45.306 --> 00:09:46.615
- Are we done? Are we ready?

00:09:46.615 --> 00:09:47.615
- I'm ready.

00:09:49.685 --> 00:09:51.175
- Okay, this one.

00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:52.284
That's cute!

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:55.654
It has little blush and
little kawaii cheeks.

00:09:55.654 --> 00:09:57.737
Ollie the Octo is hungry.

00:09:59.034 --> 00:09:59.867
The oct--

00:09:59.867 --> 00:10:01.064
The next octopus-- (mumbles)

00:10:01.064 --> 00:10:02.466
- To be honest, it's a little scary.

00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:03.574
The eyes are like--

00:10:03.574 --> 00:10:04.885
- To be honest it's really--

00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:05.718
- It's kinda creeping me out.

00:10:05.718 --> 00:10:06.626
- And then this one.

00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:09.485
- It's another little creepy one.

00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:10.906
- No, it's all right.

00:10:10.906 --> 00:10:13.186
Actually, the eyes are
kind of on point though.

00:10:13.186 --> 00:10:14.285
'Cause they do kinda come out.

00:10:14.285 --> 00:10:16.034
So the one that we picked--

00:10:16.034 --> 00:10:16.874
- I already see it.

00:10:16.874 --> 00:10:20.329
- For the loser, is the scary one.

00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:22.193
- Okay. I'm out!

00:10:22.193 --> 00:10:24.981
- Aw! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.

00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:26.233
I feel really bad.

00:10:26.233 --> 00:10:27.262
- Hi, guys! (groans)

00:10:27.262 --> 00:10:28.662
I have a stomachache, oh my god.

00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:30.257
- How do you guys feel about that?

00:10:30.257 --> 00:10:31.476
Like how we did that last voting?

00:10:31.476 --> 00:10:32.746
- I liked it.

00:10:32.746 --> 00:10:34.665
But I also didn't like it.

00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.248
(Laughter)

00:10:36.248 --> 00:10:37.081
- It was fair.

00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:38.506
- You guys think this round was more fair

00:10:38.506 --> 00:10:39.517
than the previous rounds?

00:10:39.517 --> 00:10:40.881
- Yeah, for sure.

00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:42.076
- Did you want me out?

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:42.909
Did you want me out?

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:43.742
- No!

00:10:43.742 --> 00:10:46.859
Actually, most of the people
that I want in the final three

00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:49.548
are there, but just like, not all of them.

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:50.512
- What'd you say?

00:10:50.512 --> 00:10:52.091
- I said most of the people
on the couch right now

00:10:52.091 --> 00:10:54.083
are what I wanted on the final three.

00:10:54.083 --> 00:10:55.558
- [Students] Aw!

00:10:55.558 --> 00:10:56.391
- [Man] Most.

00:10:56.391 --> 00:10:57.397
- [Male Student] Most.

00:10:57.397 --> 00:10:58.230
- Most?

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.343
- One of you aren't my favorite.

00:11:00.343 --> 00:11:01.645
- [Man] I'm going to
start this final round.

00:11:01.645 --> 00:11:04.171
You have to decide who's the one person

00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:06.269
that leaves with the money.

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:07.102
- What were you going to say?

00:11:07.102 --> 00:11:08.461
- I feel like we should...

00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:09.571
For this last round we should like...

00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:11.701
You know, obviously state our opinions.

00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:13.710
- You guys want our opinions? Or no?

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.543
- No?

00:11:15.848 --> 00:11:17.669
As long as we don't know if
they're singling one of us out,

00:11:17.669 --> 00:11:19.179
or something then I think that's fair.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.328
Okay, yeah. We'll hear it. Sure.

00:11:20.328 --> 00:11:21.828
- I'd say Heather.

00:11:22.677 --> 00:11:25.699
I don't know, you just
like, have an impact on me.

00:11:25.699 --> 00:11:27.538
- Yeah, what do you think, EJ?

00:11:27.538 --> 00:11:30.037
- Uh, I would say Heather too.

00:11:30.037 --> 00:11:31.497
Don't take it as like, pity.

00:11:31.497 --> 00:11:32.597
Like, "They're pitying me!"

00:11:32.597 --> 00:11:34.302
It's like if you need it, you need it.

00:11:34.302 --> 00:11:35.688
- I would also say Heather.

00:11:35.688 --> 00:11:38.078
I honestly think that she needs it.

00:11:38.078 --> 00:11:42.911
- Earlier I said Heather, so
I'm gonna keep that decision.

00:11:44.099 --> 00:11:48.008
- Hearing everyone's opinion
and everyone's stories,

00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:50.338
I cannot can compare myself

00:11:50.338 --> 00:11:51.720
to what you two are going through.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.982
I live in a city where there's
a lot of things accessible.

00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:56.190
I have a job, you know?

00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.423
I have great supporting
parents, so I just want...

00:12:00.423 --> 00:12:02.334
I wanna vote myself off.

00:12:02.334 --> 00:12:05.854
Just because you guys
deserve a lot more than I do.

00:12:05.854 --> 00:12:09.009
I'm definitely going to vote
but, it's gonna be kinda hard.

00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:10.309
So, I'm opting myself out!

00:12:10.309 --> 00:12:12.606
I'm just gonna sit over here.

00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:13.867
- So like, specifically,

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:14.856
what are you going to use the money for?

00:12:14.856 --> 00:12:16.627
'Cause I know you have like,
a lot of stuff going on.

00:12:16.627 --> 00:12:18.246
- I would probably use really it for a car

00:12:18.246 --> 00:12:21.526
because my main thing is
transportation and getting around.

00:12:21.526 --> 00:12:23.376
Because for school...

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:25.506
That's like, for getting there, 10 bucks.

00:12:25.506 --> 00:12:28.372
For getting back, 10 bucks.
For going to work, 10 bucks.

00:12:28.372 --> 00:12:29.230
It's a lot of money.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.063
- Yeah.

00:12:30.063 --> 00:12:30.896
- Going straight to transportation

00:12:30.896 --> 00:12:32.208
when I could be using
it for better things.

00:12:32.208 --> 00:12:33.368
Like for school.

00:12:33.368 --> 00:12:34.779
- How many hours do you work?

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:35.950
- Upwards of 30.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.248
- Okay, so you work like, a full job

00:12:37.248 --> 00:12:38.979
and then you also do
school on top of that.

00:12:38.979 --> 00:12:41.078
So you probably work that many
hours because you have to.

00:12:41.078 --> 00:12:41.911
To pay for like,

00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:44.898
for food, and your
transportation, and stuff.

00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:47.435
I mean, I'm going to give
it to Heather if you are.

00:12:47.435 --> 00:12:48.268
I'm pretty cool with that.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.336
- Yeah. I'm totally fine.

00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:51.675
- I think we're going
to give it to Heather.

00:12:51.675 --> 00:12:53.835
- I just feel really bad.

00:12:53.835 --> 00:12:55.166
- This is not pity thing.

00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:57.246
This is obviously a really big need, so.

00:12:57.246 --> 00:12:58.079
- Yeah.

00:12:58.079 --> 00:12:58.912
- Yeah!

00:12:58.912 --> 00:12:59.745
We're set.

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.995
(Applause)

00:13:04.273 --> 00:13:05.596
- Can we do a group hug?

00:13:05.596 --> 00:13:06.429
- Yeah!

00:13:06.429 --> 00:13:07.262
- Can we all do a group hug?

00:13:07.262 --> 00:13:08.262
- Thank you!

00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:11.967
- [Man] How was this
experience for you guys?

00:13:11.967 --> 00:13:15.037
- It was a lot more than I anticipated.

00:13:15.037 --> 00:13:16.866
- Well, it's not an easy
thing to do to be like,

00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:18.397
"This is why I should get money,

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:19.846
"and none of you guys should get money."

00:13:19.846 --> 00:13:21.771
It's just like a weird situation to be in.

00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:22.604
- [Man] Yeah.

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:24.155
Did anything surprise you
about your behavior today?

00:13:24.155 --> 00:13:26.955
- Yeah. I was really mean
and I wasn't expecting that.

00:13:26.955 --> 00:13:30.133
I had a lot of rage and I don't
usually have that much rage.

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:31.795
So, It kinda just surprised me.

00:13:31.795 --> 00:13:35.485
- I didn't know I'd be so vulnerable.

00:13:35.485 --> 00:13:37.078
And like I'm not an emotional person.

00:13:37.078 --> 00:13:38.729
So like, it was a good thing.

00:13:38.729 --> 00:13:39.838
- When you need something really bad,

00:13:39.838 --> 00:13:42.887
you're willing to sacrifice what you...

00:13:42.887 --> 00:13:43.838
What you usually do.

00:13:43.838 --> 00:13:45.339
I'd say.

00:13:45.339 --> 00:13:47.988
(applause)

00:13:47.988 --> 00:13:49.787
(chatter)

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:50.620
- Oh my god.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.127
- Dinner is on me, you guys!

00:13:52.127 --> 00:13:54.608
McDonald's for everyone! (laughs)

00:13:54.608 --> 00:13:58.191
(dramatic classical music)
