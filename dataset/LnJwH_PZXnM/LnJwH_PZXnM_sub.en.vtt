00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:12.013
(Referee whistle sound)

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:14.161
Good evening!

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.190
Good evening. How are you?

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.808
Are you good? Great!

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:21.211
Welcome, welcome, welcome to this match.

00:00:21.416 --> 00:00:25.012
This match will take exactly 18 minutes.

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:28.295
OK? And you're all part of the same team:

00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:30.080
Mechelen.

00:00:30.127 --> 00:00:31.169
OK?

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.717
Hey guys, I would like to see
fair play on the field,

00:00:34.717 --> 00:00:37.206
respect and positivity.

00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:39.677
Is that OK for everyone?

00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:41.486
Cool.

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:43.047
Good luck!

00:00:43.498 --> 00:00:48.538
One year ago, I decided
I wanted to become a football referee.

00:00:48.892 --> 00:00:51.547
Not because of the money, though.

00:00:51.547 --> 00:00:53.920
I only get paid 20 euros per match.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.886
So I won't really get rich by it, will I?

00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:01.799
No. I decided to become a referee 
for two other reasons.

00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:05.345
One - to stay in good shape.

00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:11.755
Two - because I wanted to learn
how not to take things personally.

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:13.497
[How not to take things personally?]

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:15.616
I can see some people nodding.

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:17.452
You are probably thinking,

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:20.269
"Being a referee
is the perfect environment

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:23.720
to learn how not to take 
things personally, isn't it?"

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:29.194
Because the spectators hardly ever 
shout encouraging or positive things.

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:30.878
No. What do they shout?

00:01:30.878 --> 00:01:31.876
Come on, come on.

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:33.610
[Audience:] "Loser! Are you blind?"

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.960
Yeah, yeah, good!

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:39.126
As a referee, I am the scapegoat.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.881
Apparently, I'm always wrong.

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.411
It's always my fault.

00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:49.290
And I wanted to learn 
how not to take all this personally.

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:53.859
Because I really struggle with this.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.932
For example, when I drive slowly

00:01:56.932 --> 00:02:00.405
because I'm trying to find
a specific location

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:03.705
and somebody is just
driving behind me,

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:05.275
I feel hunted.

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:08.628
Especially when they start honking 
and flashing their headlights,

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:11.520
I take it personally.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.400
I know I shouldn't, but it just happens.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.472
Do you see what I mean?

00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:22.177
Or when somebody cancels 
an appointment last minute,

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:25.253
I get the feeling
that I'm not important enough.

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:28.789
Again, I take it personally.

00:02:30.073 --> 00:02:31.774
Even professionally.

00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:33.513
I'm a public speaker, like tonight.

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:34.833
This is what I do.

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:37.846
I give keynote speeches,
and I really like it

00:02:37.846 --> 00:02:41.126
as long as I can draw 
my audience into my story.

00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:46.458
Because the very moment 
I see somebody is not paying attention -

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:49.448
for example, when somebody
is looking at his smartphone -

00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:52.069
(snap) it just happens:

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.115
I take it personally.

00:02:54.722 --> 00:02:55.898
Relax!

00:02:55.898 --> 00:02:58.448
You are safe tonight. Don't worry.

00:02:58.448 --> 00:03:00.207
Feel free to take your smartphones,

00:03:00.207 --> 00:03:02.514
and you can even start talking 
to your neighbor.

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:04.916
I will not take it personally.

00:03:04.916 --> 00:03:06.076
Why not?

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:10.256
Because now, here and now,
I'm very conscious that this can happen.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:13.980
And more importantly, 
I have a strategy to deal with it.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:19.360
So tonight, I would like to share
this strategy with you.

00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:21.406
Are you interested?

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.414
Cool.

00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:26.866
Because, I guess, I'm not 
the only person in this room

00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:29.673
who sometimes takes
things personally, right?

00:03:30.636 --> 00:03:32.003
Imagine -

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:35.571
imagine you invite a friend
to go to the movies, and she replies,

00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:37.584
"Oh, sorry, I have to work."

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:41.304
But you see a picture on social media

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:45.748
of her having dinner
with some friends that very night!

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:50.935
Or imagine you really have worked
very hard on a project.

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:52.998
You're really proud of the end result,

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.210
but the only thing you get is criticism.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.621
So you come home,

00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:03.023
and you would like to wind down
and share this terrible experience.

00:04:03.227 --> 00:04:05.305
But while you're telling your story,

00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:08.902
the other one walks away 
to switch on the TV.

00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:13.353
Now, who would take
one of these situations personally?

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.070
Show me hands, come on.

00:04:15.563 --> 00:04:17.100
Lots of you.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.300
Why?

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.136
Why do we take things personally?

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:25.186
Somebody says
or does something and bam!

00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:30.567
We feel hurt, neglected, offended, 
betrayed by the other one.

00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:32.097
That's what we believe, though.

00:04:32.097 --> 00:04:34.260
It's the other person's fault.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.636
He's responsible for what we feel.

00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:38.392
He's the one to blame.

00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:40.427
Now, hang on, hang on.

00:04:40.427 --> 00:04:42.293
Who says that?

00:04:42.293 --> 00:04:44.408
Which part of us is speaking?

00:04:44.408 --> 00:04:45.674
[Why?]

00:04:45.674 --> 00:04:46.684
[Ego]

00:04:46.684 --> 00:04:48.391
It's our ego.

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:53.161
Our ego thinks that others
should take us into consideration.

00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:56.123
Our ego doesn't want 
to be criticized, hell no!

00:04:56.123 --> 00:04:58.974
Our ego wants to be acknowledged:

00:04:58.974 --> 00:05:00.404
"I'm right!"

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:04.163
Is this what you want?

00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:06.808
Do you want to be right?

00:05:06.808 --> 00:05:08.150
[Do you want to be right?]

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.159
(Sigh)

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:10.705
That's exhausting.

00:05:10.705 --> 00:05:13.916
When my ego takes over, 
I'm fighting all day.

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:17.120
I'm in a constant struggle 
with the rest of the world.

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:19.453
And it drains my energy.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.695
Wouldn't it be so much easier 
to not take things personally?

00:05:24.975 --> 00:05:28.134
Because then no one has power over you.

00:05:28.134 --> 00:05:29.268
You're free.

00:05:29.268 --> 00:05:31.530
You experience much more 
harmony and connection

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.435
between you and other people.

00:05:33.435 --> 00:05:34.595
Of course!

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:38.100
Because your energy 
can go towards nice things

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.914
instead of endlessly battling 
against the things that drive you crazy.

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:46.063
So the question is

00:05:46.063 --> 00:05:51.803
do you want to be right
or do you want to be happy?

00:05:53.044 --> 00:05:55.281
I know what some of you are thinking:

00:05:55.281 --> 00:05:59.474
"I will make sure
I will be happy by being right."

00:06:00.867 --> 00:06:02.829
Well, how do you do it?

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:07.999
How to become happy
by not taking things personally?

00:06:08.347 --> 00:06:13.063
You are standing at the kickoff
of the match of your life,

00:06:13.063 --> 00:06:17.713
the match by which you will learn
how to stop taking things personally.

00:06:17.992 --> 00:06:22.173
So as a referee,
I brought my coin for the toss.

00:06:22.487 --> 00:06:28.480
And every coin has two sides:
heads or tails.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.884
And they stand for two strategies,

00:06:30.884 --> 00:06:34.707
two strategies to no longer
taking things personally.

00:06:35.518 --> 00:06:37.532
Sir, sir, good evening.

00:06:37.532 --> 00:06:40.561
You're the captain of this huge team.

00:06:40.561 --> 00:06:42.697
You can choose: heads or tails?

00:06:42.697 --> 00:06:43.710
("Captain") Heads.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.910
Okay.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.974
You're lucky. It's heads!

00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:51.185
Are you ready for the first strategy?

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:53.625
OK, here it comes.

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:55.015
First strategy -

00:06:55.015 --> 00:06:57.265
It's not about me.

00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:00.382
What do you mean it's not about me?

00:07:00.872 --> 00:07:03.233
This sounds weird, doesn't it?

00:07:03.233 --> 00:07:08.622
Because when I take things personally,
I'm convinced it is about me.

00:07:08.622 --> 00:07:11.946
When I see someone is looking
at his phone, I feel offended.

00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:16.226
I think, "Hey, I've put so much effort
and time in this presentation.

00:07:16.606 --> 00:07:18.185
I want respect."

00:07:18.185 --> 00:07:21.675
I think, "Me, myself and I."

00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:24.651
Sounds familiar, no? Yeah.

00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:28.911
But in fact, it isn't about me.

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:33.520
What if I try to look at it
from the other person's perspective,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.271
asking myself,

00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:39.664
"Why? Why is he or she
looking at his or her smartphone?"

00:07:39.765 --> 00:07:44.489
Maybe he has just received an important
message, one he has been waiting for.

00:07:44.794 --> 00:07:49.512
Or the topic of my presentation
is not really his cup of tea.

00:07:49.512 --> 00:07:50.711
Could be!

00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:53.567
Or, on the contrary,
he finds it very interesting

00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:56.294
and he wants to take notes
on his smartphone.

00:07:56.294 --> 00:07:58.645
Very smart to do that, by the way.

00:07:59.809 --> 00:08:05.243
I simply need to shift my focus
from "me" to "we,"

00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:07.971
and I won't take it personally.

00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:11.459
If I try to see the intention
of the other one,

00:08:11.885 --> 00:08:16.456
I make space for understanding
instead of irritation.

00:08:17.075 --> 00:08:19.178
Does this ring a bell with you?

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.660
When you put your son to bed
but he doesn't want to,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.546
he throws himself on the floor,
kicking and screaming "I hate you!"

00:08:27.523 --> 00:08:29.726
Do you take that personally?

00:08:30.268 --> 00:08:31.269
No!

00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:34.839
No, you don't because you know 
this is not about me.

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:37.377
It's about what he wants, what he needs.

00:08:37.377 --> 00:08:42.022
He's angry because he just wants
to stay up a bit longer, that's all.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:45.379
So the first strategy 
to not take it personally is

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:46.625
it's not about me.

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:50.645
Look at the other person's intention.

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:54.390
When a driver is tailgating
and flashing his lights,

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.005
he probably does it
because he's in a hurry.

00:08:57.005 --> 00:08:59.515
It's not about me, you see?

00:09:00.096 --> 00:09:02.813
It's as simple as that.

00:09:05.243 --> 00:09:06.773
In theory.

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:10.693
Because in real life,
it turns out to be a hell of a job.

00:09:12.078 --> 00:09:14.473
Do you have any idea, 
ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:14.473 --> 00:09:17.873
how many thoughts 
our brain produces a day?

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:21.981
50,000!

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.430
And guess how many of them are positive?

00:09:25.758 --> 00:09:28.308
Only 10,000.

00:09:28.308 --> 00:09:34.758
So this means that 80% of what we think
are negative thoughts.

00:09:34.758 --> 00:09:36.608
That's a lot, isn't it?

00:09:38.216 --> 00:09:41.043
When you see two colleagues
talking to each other,

00:09:41.043 --> 00:09:45.234
and just then, they look at you
and they start laughing,

00:09:45.234 --> 00:09:46.494
do you think,

00:09:46.494 --> 00:09:51.425
"Oh, they must have noticed my new shoes
and they want them too"?

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:52.586
No!

00:09:52.586 --> 00:09:53.836
Or do you think,

00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:56.356
"Darn, they're laughing at me.

00:09:56.356 --> 00:09:58.581
They are gossiping about me."

00:09:59.114 --> 00:10:02.130
So it takes a lot of effort 
to correct yourself and say,

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.260
"Hang on. I have no clue!

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.419
They might be laughing about something
that has nothing to do with me."

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.957
So seeing the positive intention
of the other one

00:10:12.957 --> 00:10:17.577
requires a lot of discipline and training.

00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:22.232
And that's why I became a referee:

00:10:22.432 --> 00:10:26.712
to train my brain
not to take things personally.

00:10:27.199 --> 00:10:30.239
I train my brain
an hour and a half a week,

00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:31.618
the entire period of a match.

00:10:31.618 --> 00:10:33.858
I say this for the football dummies.

00:10:34.138 --> 00:10:36.247
Now, before the match, I'm warming up.

00:10:36.247 --> 00:10:38.447
Not only physically, but also mentally.

00:10:38.447 --> 00:10:42.198
I give myself some pep talk
in the dressing room:

00:10:42.198 --> 00:10:43.320
"Frederik, watch out.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.812
Lots of things will trigger you
during the game.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:49.342
You're going to make decisions
who some will not agree with

00:10:49.342 --> 00:10:51.880
and they will shout
unpleasant things at you."

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.129
So I tell myself,

00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:56.003
"Frederik, don't take it personally.

00:10:56.003 --> 00:10:57.768
It's not about me.

00:10:58.927 --> 00:11:00.908
They just want to be right.

00:11:00.908 --> 00:11:04.978
They simply want their team to win."

00:11:04.978 --> 00:11:06.368
You see?

00:11:06.368 --> 00:11:09.530
When I focus on the intention
of the other person,

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.126
there's no need to take it personally.

00:11:12.885 --> 00:11:16.310
When I apply this strategy
very consciously,

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.135
I admit it, I feel much more 
at ease on the field.

00:11:20.203 --> 00:11:23.204
When the coach,
the players or the spectators

00:11:23.204 --> 00:11:25.624
do not agree with my decisions,

00:11:25.624 --> 00:11:28.994
I'm less easily thrown off balance.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.905
This strategy, 
ladies and gentlemen, works!

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.600
But not always, unfortunately.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.174
Because some words they shout at me,
like here, do really hit a raw nerve:

00:11:43.352 --> 00:11:45.790
"You're a loser. Choose another hobby!

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.538
You know what? Go fishing!"

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.669
Ouch!

00:11:51.573 --> 00:11:54.557
Maybe they are right.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.200
Perhaps I took the wrong decision.

00:11:58.201 --> 00:11:59.687
Maybe I am a loser.

00:11:59.687 --> 00:12:03.415
Honestly, that's how I feel sometimes.

00:12:04.783 --> 00:12:06.360
Do you see this?

00:12:06.558 --> 00:12:10.180
Every coin has a flip side.

00:12:10.357 --> 00:12:15.147
When this first strategy -
it's not about me - doesn't work,

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.172
it simply means "It is about me!"

00:12:19.172 --> 00:12:20.557
[It is about me.]

00:12:22.062 --> 00:12:24.762
I have to look in the mirror
and question myself.

00:12:24.823 --> 00:12:27.950
As a beginning referee,
I still feel insecure.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.087
Especially me.

00:12:29.087 --> 00:12:31.667
I never played soccer.

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:32.670
It is about me

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.457
because it has something to do
with my insecurity,

00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:38.389
I doubt about myself.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.438
Or a part of myself
that I haven't come to terms with.

00:12:44.384 --> 00:12:46.760
Do you see my point, ladies and gentlemen?

00:12:47.175 --> 00:12:48.611
Even if I know

00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:52.187
that a driver is only tailgating
because he's in a hurry,

00:12:52.187 --> 00:12:57.336
I still take it personally when he honks
or he's flashing his headlights.

00:12:57.336 --> 00:12:58.959
So I must question myself.

00:12:58.959 --> 00:13:02.873
Probably I was driving too slowly.

00:13:02.887 --> 00:13:04.244
I'm aware of it.

00:13:04.244 --> 00:13:08.592
I just don't like
that clumsy part of myself.

00:13:08.592 --> 00:13:11.519
Why else would I 
take it personally, right?

00:13:12.383 --> 00:13:13.543
When I say,

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:16.633
"Ladies and gentlemen,
you are an orange,"

00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:19.511
who would take this personally?

00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:21.302
No one, right?

00:13:21.302 --> 00:13:22.357
Why not?

00:13:22.357 --> 00:13:26.877
Because nothing in you believes
that you are in fact an orange.

00:13:26.877 --> 00:13:28.267
An orange?

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.660
Unless, of course, that you're a ginger
and you feel bad because of that.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.679
Which is luckily not the case with me.

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:40.217
But - but when someone says,
"Frederik, you are so selfish."

00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:41.898
Ouch!

00:13:41.898 --> 00:13:43.478
I do take it personally.

00:13:43.478 --> 00:13:47.478
And it only happens because I know
there is some truth in it.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.760
If I'm honest,

00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:54.553
I'm aware of the fact that I do not always
take into account other people's needs.

00:13:57.065 --> 00:13:59.339
When you are being criticized

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.153
and it hurts,

00:14:01.153 --> 00:14:06.417
chances are big that this
is rooted in your childhood.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.072
Maybe as a child
you were never good enough.

00:14:10.326 --> 00:14:12.251
When you came home with a 9 out of 10,

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:14.796
they said, "Hey, and why not a 10?"

00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:16.791
You see?

00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:22.936
We can only take things personally
if it somehow touches a raw nerve.

00:14:23.709 --> 00:14:28.099
And that's the moment
to give yourself some empathy.

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:32.930
Ooh, this hurts. Darn!

00:14:33.608 --> 00:14:36.505
I'm longing so hard for recognition,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.950
and I feel sad if I don't get it.

00:14:40.381 --> 00:14:41.571
You see?

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.268
And you can also - why not? - speak up.

00:14:44.414 --> 00:14:47.664
Just tell the other one
what's going on inside you.

00:14:48.106 --> 00:14:51.500
"Hey, I'm in the middle of my story here,

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.087
and you just walk away
to switch on the TV?

00:14:54.087 --> 00:14:56.900
It feels as if you don't care
about my story.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.530
It's not nice."

00:14:59.206 --> 00:15:01.960
By opening up, by being vulnerable,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.418
by telling what you feel
without blaming the other one,

00:15:05.418 --> 00:15:08.943
you increase the chance
that the other one will understand you

00:15:08.943 --> 00:15:11.381
and take your needs into account.

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:13.639
Do you see what I mean?

00:15:14.585 --> 00:15:16.040
To conclude -

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.380
how not to take things personally.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.600
One - it is not about me!

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.695
Look at the other person's intention.

00:15:26.695 --> 00:15:28.227
If that doesn't work:

00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:31.167
two - it is about me.

00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:33.737
Give yourself empathy and speak up.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.210
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:41.399
please, pretty please,
do not take it personally,

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:45.609
but I really do hope that you will take
a couple of things personally

00:15:45.609 --> 00:15:47.084
within the next hours and days.

00:15:47.084 --> 00:15:51.104
Only if you do, you can test out 
these two strategies.

00:15:52.044 --> 00:15:58.004
Imagine, just imagine
if we could all put this in practice.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.425
Wouldn't that enhance
our relationships enormously?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.086
Together we could create a better world.

00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:08.467
Wouldn't that be great?

00:16:10.026 --> 00:16:14.440
And as a referee,
I even earn some money by it.

00:16:15.127 --> 00:16:18.807
Who doesn't like 20 euros to learn
how not to take things personally?

00:16:18.807 --> 00:16:20.237
Show me hands.

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:21.369
Show me hands.

00:16:21.369 --> 00:16:22.578
Oh, so many.

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:27.629
Who still wants the 20 euros now?

00:16:34.677 --> 00:16:37.287
Who still wants the 20 euros now?

00:16:40.612 --> 00:16:42.750
Who still wants the 20 euros now?

00:16:48.845 --> 00:16:50.845
And who still wants them now?

00:16:52.099 --> 00:16:55.175
Why do you still want these 20 euros?

00:16:55.424 --> 00:16:58.134
(Audience member)
Because it's still 20 euros!

00:16:58.322 --> 00:17:04.271
People may attack you, 
criticize you or ignore you.

00:17:05.127 --> 00:17:11.807
They can crumple you up with their words,
spit you out or even walk all over you.

00:17:12.452 --> 00:17:14.279
But remember:

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.826
whatever they do or say,

00:17:18.772 --> 00:17:21.489
you will always keep your value.

00:17:23.313 --> 00:17:24.482
Thank you.

00:17:24.482 --> 00:17:26.297
(Applause)
