10,15,Good evening ! Good
15,20,"evening . How are you ? Are you good ? Great ! Welcome , welcome ,"
20,25,welcome to this match . This match will take exactly 18
25,30,minutes . OK ? And you 're all part of the same team :
30,35,"Mechelen . OK ? Hey guys , I would like to see fair play on the field ,"
35,40,respect and positivity . Is that OK for everyone ?
40,45,"Cool . Good luck ! One year ago , I"
45,50,decided I wanted to become a football referee . Not because
50,55,"of the money , though . I only get paid 20 euros per match . So I wo n't"
55,60,"really get rich by it , will I ? No . I decided to become a referee"
60,65,for two other reasons . One to stay in good
65,70,shape . Two because I wanted to learn how not to take
70,75,things personally . I can see some
75,80,"people nodding . You are probably thinking , "" Being a referee is the perfect"
80,85,"environment to learn how not to take things personally , is n't it ? "" Because the"
85,90,spectators hardly ever shout encouraging or positive things . No . What do
90,95,"they shout ? Come on , come on . "" Loser ! Are you blind ? "" Yeah ,"
95,100,"yeah , good ! As a referee , I am the scapegoat ."
100,105,"Apparently , I 'm always wrong . It 's always my fault . And I"
105,110,wanted to learn how not to take all this personally .
110,115,Because I really struggle with this . For
115,120,"example , when I drive slowly because I 'm trying to find a specific"
120,125,"location and somebody is just driving behind me , I feel"
125,130,"hunted . Especially when they start honking and flashing their headlights ,"
130,135,"I take it personally . I know I should n't , but it"
135,140,just happens . Do you see what I mean ? Or when
140,145,"somebody cancels an appointment last minute , I get the feeling that I 'm not important"
145,150,"enough . Again , I take it personally ."
150,155,"Even professionally . I 'm a public speaker , like tonight . This is what I do . I"
155,160,"give keynote speeches , and I really like it as long as I can draw my"
160,165,audience into my story . Because the very moment I see somebody is
165,170,"not paying attention - for example , when somebody is looking at his smartphone -"
170,175,it just happens : I take it personally .
175,180,Relax ! You are safe tonight . Do n't worry . Feel free to take your
180,185,"smartphones , and you can even start talking to your neighbor . I will not take it personally ."
185,190,"Why not ? Because now , here and now , I 'm very conscious that this can"
190,195,"happen . And more importantly , I have a strategy to deal with it ."
195,200,"So tonight , I would like to share this strategy with you ."
200,205,"Are you interested ? Cool . Because , I guess , I 'm not"
205,210,"the only person in this room who sometimes takes things personally , right ?"
210,215,"Imagine - imagine you invite a friend to go to the movies , and"
215,220,"she replies , "" Oh , sorry , I have to work . "" But you see a picture"
220,225,on social media of her having dinner with some friends that
225,230,very night ! Or imagine you really have worked very
230,235,"hard on a project . You 're really proud of the end result , but the only"
235,240,"thing you get is criticism . So you come home , and you would like to"
240,245,wind down and share this terrible experience . But while you 're telling your
245,250,"story , the other one walks away to switch on the TV ."
250,255,"Now , who would take one of these situations personally ? Show me hands , come"
255,260,on . Lots of you . Why ?
260,265,Why do we take things personally ? Somebody says or does something and
265,270,"bam ! We feel hurt , neglected , offended , betrayed by the"
270,275,"other one . That 's what we believe , though . It 's the other person 's fault . He 's"
275,280,"responsible for what we feel . He 's the one to blame . Now , hang on ,"
280,285,hang on . Who says that ? Which part of us is speaking ?
285,290,It 's our ego . Our ego thinks that
290,295,others should take us into consideration . Our ego does n't want to be
295,300,"criticized , hell no ! Our ego wants to be acknowledged : "" I 'm"
300,305,"right ! "" Is this what you want ? Do"
305,310,you want to be right ? That 's
310,315,"exhausting . When my ego takes over , I 'm fighting all day . I 'm in a constant"
315,320,struggle with the rest of the world . And it drains my energy .
320,325,Would n't it be so much easier to not take things personally ?
325,330,Because then no one has power over you . You 're free . You experience
330,335,much more harmony and connection between you and other people . Of course !
335,340,Because your energy can go towards nice things instead of endlessly
340,345,battling against the things that drive you crazy . So the
345,350,question is do you want to be right or do you
350,355,want to be happy ? I know what some of you are
355,360,"thinking : "" I will make sure I will be happy by being right . """
360,365,"Well , how do you do it ? How to become happy by"
365,370,not taking things personally ? You are standing at
370,375,"the kickoff of the match of your life , the match by which you will"
375,380,"learn how to stop taking things personally . So as a referee , I"
380,385,brought my coin for the toss . And every coin
385,390,has two sides : heads or tails . And they stand for
390,395,"two strategies , two strategies to no longer taking things personally ."
395,400,"Sir , sir , good evening . You 're the captain of this"
400,405,huge team . You can choose : heads or tails ? Heads . Okay .
405,410,You 're lucky . It 's heads ! Are you ready
410,415,"for the first strategy ? OK , here it comes . First"
415,420,strategy - It 's not about me . What do you mean it 's not
420,425,"about me ? This sounds weird , does n't it ? Because when I take"
425,430,"things personally , I 'm convinced it is about me . When I see someone is"
430,435,"looking at his phone , I feel offended . I think , "" Hey , I 've put so much effort and time in"
435,440,"this presentation . I want respect . "" I think , "" Me ,"
440,445,"myself and I. "" Sounds familiar , no ? Yeah ."
445,450,"But in fact , it is n't about me . What if I try"
450,455,"to look at it from the other person 's perspective , asking"
455,460,"myself , "" Why ? Why is he or she looking at his or her smartphone ? """
460,465,"Maybe he has just received an important message , one he has been waiting for . Or"
465,470,the topic of my presentation is not really his cup of tea .
470,475,"Could be ! Or , on the contrary , he finds it very interesting and he wants to take"
475,480,"notes on his smartphone . Very smart to do that , by the way . I"
480,485,"simply need to shift my focus from "" me "" to "" we , """
485,490,and I wo n't take it personally . If I try to see the
490,495,"intention of the other one , I make space for understanding"
495,500,instead of irritation . Does this ring a bell with you ?
500,505,"When you put your son to bed but he does n't want to , he throws himself on the floor ,"
505,510,"kicking and screaming "" I hate you ! "" Do you take that personally ?"
510,515,"No ! No , you do n't because you know this is not about me ."
515,520,"It 's about what he wants , what he needs . He 's angry because he just wants to"
520,525,"stay up a bit longer , that 's all . So the first strategy to not take it"
525,530,personally is it 's not about me . Look at the other person 's
530,535,"intention . When a driver is tailgating and flashing his lights , he"
535,540,"probably does it because he 's in a hurry . It 's not about me , you see ?"
540,545,It 's as simple as that .
545,550,"In theory . Because in real life , it turns out to be a"
550,555,"hell of a job . Do you have any idea , ladies and gentlemen , how"
555,560,many thoughts our brain produces a day ?
560,565,"50,000 ! And guess how many of them are"
565,570,"positive ? Only 10,000 . So this means"
570,575,that 80 % of what we think are negative thoughts .
575,580,"That 's a lot , is n't it ? When you see two colleagues"
580,585,"talking to each other , and just then , they look at you and they start"
585,590,"laughing , do you think , "" Oh , they must have noticed my new shoes and"
590,595,"they want them too "" ? No ! Or do you think , "" Darn , they"
595,600,"'re laughing at me . They are gossiping about me . "" So it takes a"
600,605,"lot of effort to correct yourself and say , "" Hang on . I have no clue ! They might"
605,610,"be laughing about something that has nothing to do with me . "" So"
610,615,seeing the positive intention of the other one requires a lot of
615,620,discipline and training . And that 's
620,625,why I became a referee : to train my brain not to take
625,630,things personally . I train my brain an hour and a half a
630,635,"week , the entire period of a match . I say this for the football dummies . Now , before"
635,640,"the match , I 'm warming up . Not only physically , but also mentally . I give myself some"
640,645,"pep talk in the dressing room : "" Frederik , watch out . Lots of things will trigger you"
645,650,during the game . You 're going to make decisions who some will not agree with and they
650,655,"will shout unpleasant things at you . "" So I tell myself , "" Frederik , do n't take"
655,660,it personally . It 's not about me . They just
660,665,"want to be right . They simply want their team to win . """
665,670,"You see ? When I focus on the intention of the other person , there"
670,675,'s no need to take it personally . When I apply this strategy
675,680,"very consciously , I admit it , I feel much more at ease on the"
680,685,"field . When the coach , the players or the spectators do not agree with my"
685,690,"decisions , I 'm less easily thrown off balance ."
690,695,"This strategy , ladies and gentlemen , works !"
695,700,"But not always , unfortunately . Because some words"
700,705,"they shout at me , like here , do really hit a raw nerve : "" You 're a loser . Choose"
705,710,"another hobby ! You know what ? Go fishing ! "" Ouch !"
710,715,Maybe they are right .
715,720,Perhaps I took the wrong decision . Maybe I am a loser .
720,725,"Honestly , that 's how I feel sometimes ."
725,730,Do you see this ? Every coin has a flip
730,735,side . When this first strategy it 's not about me does n't
735,740,"work , it simply means "" It is about me ! """
740,745,I have to look in the mirror and question myself . As
745,750,"a beginning referee , I still feel insecure . Especially me . I never"
750,755,played soccer . It is about me because it has something to do
755,760,"with my insecurity , I doubt about myself . Or a part of"
760,765,myself that I have n't come to terms with . Do you see
765,770,"my point , ladies and gentlemen ? Even if I know that a driver is only"
770,775,"tailgating because he 's in a hurry , I still take it personally when he"
775,780,honks or he 's flashing his headlights . So I must question myself .
780,785,Probably I was driving too slowly . I 'm aware of it . I just
785,790,do n't like that clumsy part of myself . Why else would I
790,795,"take it personally , right ? When I say , "" Ladies and"
795,800,"gentlemen , you are an orange , "" who would take this personally ?"
800,805,"No one , right ? Why not ? Because nothing in you believes"
805,810,"that you are in fact an orange . An orange ? Unless , of course , that"
810,815,you 're a ginger and you feel bad because of that . Which is luckily not the case with me .
815,820,"But but when someone says , "" Frederik , you are so selfish . """
820,825,Ouch ! I do take it personally . And it only happens
825,830,"because I know there is some truth in it . If I 'm honest ,"
830,835,I 'm aware of the fact that I do not always take into account other people 's needs .
835,840,When you are being criticized and
840,845,"it hurts , chances are big that this is rooted in"
845,850,your childhood . Maybe as a child you were never good
850,855,"enough . When you came home with a 9 out of 10 , they said , "" Hey , and why not a 10 ? """
855,860,You see ? We can only take things personally
860,865,if it somehow touches a raw nerve . And that 's the
865,870,"moment to give yourself some empathy . Ooh ,"
870,875,this hurts . Darn ! I 'm longing so
875,880,"hard for recognition , and I feel sad if I do n't get it ."
880,885,You see ? And you can also why not ? speak up . Just
885,890,"tell the other one what 's going on inside you . "" Hey , I 'm in the"
890,895,"middle of my story here , and you just walk away to switch on the TV ? It feels as if"
895,900,"you do n't care about my story . It 's not nice . "" By"
900,905,"opening up , by being vulnerable , by telling what you feel without blaming the"
905,910,"other one , you increase the chance that the other one will understand you and take your"
910,915,needs into account . Do you see what I mean ? To
915,920,conclude - how not to take things personally .
920,925,One it is not about me ! Look at the
925,930,other person 's intention . If that does n't work : two it is
930,935,about me . Give yourself empathy and speak up .
935,940,"Ladies and gentlemen , please , pretty please , do"
940,945,"not take it personally , but I really do hope that you will take a couple of things"
945,950,"personally within the next hours and days . Only if you do , you can test out these"
950,955,"two strategies . Imagine , just imagine if we"
955,960,could all put this in practice . Would n't that enhance
960,965,our relationships enormously ? Together we could create
965,970,a better world . Would n't that be great ?
970,975,"And as a referee , I even earn some money by it ."
975,980,Who does n't like 20 euros to learn how not to take things personally ? Show me
980,985,"hands . Show me hands . Oh , so many ."
985,990,Who still wants the 20 euros now ?
990,995,Who
995,1000,still wants the 20 euros now ?
1000,1005,Who still wants the 20 euros now ?
1005,1010,And who still
1010,1015,wants them now ? Why do you still want these 20
1015,1020,euros ? Because it 's still 20 euros ! People may
1020,1025,"attack you , criticize you or ignore you ."
1025,1030,"They can crumple you up with their words , spit you out or"
1030,1035,even walk all over you . But remember :
1035,1040,"whatever they do or say , you will"
1040,1045,always keep your value . Thank you .
