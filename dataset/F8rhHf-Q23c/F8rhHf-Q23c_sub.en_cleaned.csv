0.24,3.75,This is the largest indoor water park in
3.76,5.59,California. Imagine how cool it would be
5.6,7.349,to have a water park all to yourself all
7.359,9.669,"night. So, today my daughter Salish and"
9.679,11.99,her best friend Nadal get to stay here
12.0,14.07,all night. They're about to dive into a
14.08,16.95,series of wild splash fil water park
16.96,19.99,challenges like never before. And the
20.0,22.47,winner gets a five-star cabana with
22.48,24.71,everything you can imagine inside. And
24.72,27.109,"the loser, well, has to spend the night"
27.119,29.429,right here under the waterfall. First
29.439,31.189,"challenge, Mountain Ridge Raceway."
31.199,33.11,Whoever gets down first and holds the
33.12,35.59,most red ball pit balls in their arms
35.6,38.95,wins. Are you ready? Yeah.
38.96,41.19,I'm obviously going to win because like
41.2,42.709,look at Needle. Do you think he's
42.719,44.79,coordinated? No. I think I got this
44.8,46.31,pretty easily cuz I'm heavier. He's like
46.32,47.51,a feather. She's going to go down so
47.52,49.75,"slow. Oh, that's sweet. Thank you. Are"
49.76,57.67,you ready? Yeah. Here we go. 3 2 1
57.68,59.75,Jess went way ahead of me. I'm not going
59.76,63.349,to win. Here they come.
63.359,65.59,Oh my gosh. She's hiding down. The doll
65.6,69.99,"is way ahead. No. No. Hurry, Sish."
70.0,72.469,Hurry. Whoever gets more red balls in
72.479,74.71,their arms in 30 seconds wins. The
74.72,77.07,doll's trying to chin me.
77.08,79.67,Uh-oh. That's I don't know. I guess all
79.68,82.469,is fair today. You guys have 10 seconds.
82.479,87.19,"9 8 7 6 Pick up some more. Say, ""Hurry"
87.2,88.39,"up, Nadal. You don't have much time"
88.4,92.789,"left."" 3 2 1. Stop. Stop. Stop. Ready."
92.799,94.469,Hold on. Wait. Wait. Whose was that?
94.479,95.83,"Mine. Oh, well that doesn't count"
95.84,98.55,"anymore. Nadal, dump yours in there."
98.56,101.19,"Sish, dump it in there. No. Nadal, you"
101.2,103.27,dropped it.
103.28,107.27,"Oh, I won. Let's count. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8"
107.28,110.55,9 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 10. She got way more. My
110.56,113.19,logo. Round one goes to sandwich water.
113.2,114.87,"I lost round number one, but I'm not"
114.88,115.91,sleeping under that mattress in the
115.92,117.19,"water. Yeah, you are. You're a loser."
117.2,124.55,"Well, she's not very supportive."
124.56,126.149,What kind of kid did I raise? Fight
126.159,130.15,back. Get him.
130.16,132.39,Nadal is down one- nothing. Moving on to
132.4,133.83,the next challenge. I thought I wasn't
133.84,135.35,going to get wet till the fourth round.
135.36,136.949,"You know you're on the water, right? I"
136.959,139.67,"do know. Oh, Sandy."
139.68,142.15,What's the What's the What's this? Thank
142.16,143.75,"you. Yeah, she wiped her nose on my"
143.76,146.309,"shirt, too. Oh my gosh. To make this"
146.319,148.39,"challenge harder, at some point in the"
148.4,150.309,"evening, I am going to blow this whistle"
150.319,152.15,and a security guard is going to come
152.16,153.99,running in to catch them. They will have
154.0,156.07,"1 minute to hide and if they get caught,"
156.08,157.91,they are automatically kicked out of the
157.92,159.27,water park. But you never know when it's
159.28,161.43,going to happen. Next challenge. Slow
161.44,164.15,"rider, you go first. Okay. This is"
164.16,165.83,"Mariana, and she is going to be"
165.84,167.99,instructing Salish and the doll what
168.0,169.91,they're trying to do. Whatever she tells
169.92,172.229,"them to do, they have to do or they lose"
172.239,174.07,the challenge. Whoever can stay on the
174.08,176.55,board the longest wins the challenge. As
176.56,178.55,"soon as you go over the lip, it starts."
178.56,179.91,"And when you come back over the lip,"
179.92,183.35,it's over. You got it.
183.36,187.509,"There he is. Oh,"
187.519,190.55,"he's just chilling. Okay. Oh, stop right"
190.56,192.229,here. It's right here. She makes it
193.76,196.07,It's cool. He's 30 seconds in. You got
201.519,203.43,All right.
203.44,206.43,And he's done it. He made
206.44,208.309,it. I don't know how you're going to do
208.319,213.11,that. You got this. Ow. Ow. Ow.
215.4,218.789,Oh. He still did it. There's over a
218.799,222.47,minute now. Oh god.
222.48,227.19,Are you waiting? He's for a minute. Oh.
227.2,230.91,Oh. No way. What?
230.92,234.63,What? What?
234.64,237.67,You're cook. This is almost 2 minutes
237.68,239.149,and he's doing
239.159,241.67,tricks. You have to do whatever she says
241.68,243.91,"to do. Oh, he's going. He's done. He's"
243.92,245.27,"done. He's done. He's Oh, he's done."
245.28,248.71,"He's done. Yeah. Good job, Neo. Great"
248.72,252.03,job. Look at that.
252.04,255.83,"204.77. Go, dude. That's crazy. That was"
255.84,258.31,"good, little girl. You got this. Let's"
258.32,261.83,"go. All right, here we go. 2 seconds."
261.84,264.87,"She's made it 5 seconds. Okay, S, get"
264.88,266.43,back down
266.44,269.31,there. Give her a little
269.32,272.629,"time. Okay, that's my girl. This might"
272.639,276.629,not be too easy for you to know.
276.639,285.99,Oh. Oh. Oh. One arm. Can you do that?
286.0,288.31,As good as yours. Really quick. Really
288.32,295.27,quick. 30 seconds. Hold on.
295.28,303.629,Oh no. Oh no.
303.639,307.51,"No. 44. At least for the obvious, Nadal"
307.52,310.31,"Wonder won that round. Tish, I hope if"
310.32,312.39,we ever do a video like this next time.
312.4,313.99,"Well, it's okay because we still have a"
314.0,315.35,lot more challenges that I'm going to
315.36,317.11,"win on. I don't think you want to. Yeah,"
317.12,318.55,I'm going to win on all of the future
318.56,320.31,challenges. They say that because they
320.32,322.31,don't know what is about to happen. Just
322.32,324.87,reminding you that this guy can show up
324.88,327.51,"at any moment. Next challenge, howling"
327.52,329.67,tornado. These cups are both filled with
329.68,331.83,water. The winner has to keep the water
331.84,334.07,in their cup until they reach the end of
334.08,336.31,the ride. Whoever spills more of it
336.32,339.189,loses. Are you ready? There we go.
339.199,340.71,You're going to get pushed down once I
340.72,343.67,do this.
343.68,345.909,And they're one step closer to sleeping
345.919,346.99,under a
347.0,349.51,waterfall. But that cabana is sick. I've
349.52,350.95,been wanting to win really hard. Here we
359.68,362.95,My guess is going to lose this round.
362.96,365.59,"Oh, I saw the spill from it off. Oh my"
368.039,370.71,"Oh, the water's already fully spilled"
370.72,375.23,out by
375.24,378.07,now. I don't I don't know. I saw some
378.08,381.67,"spill. What was that? Hey, wait."
381.68,383.43,Neither of them won. And we are going to
383.44,385.99,have to redo that challenge because as I
386.0,388.469,"discovered later, they both cheated. I I"
388.479,394.71,saw that. I saw that.
394.72,397.11,I have a very weird feeling they both
397.12,401.189,filled their cups up on the way down.
401.199,403.35,"In case it wasn't obvious, you're not"
403.36,406.309,"allowed to fill your cup up. Oh, so I"
406.319,409.43,put colored water. So now we know if you
409.44,412.07,fill it up.
412.08,413.749,"No, that's it. Actually, I forgot to"
413.759,415.43,mention that they are not allowed to
415.44,417.029,cover the top of the cup with their
417.039,419.589,"hands, but I think they'll be fine. Here"
419.599,422.39,you go. Don't spill. Here we go. Are you
422.4,424.629,"ready? Yeah. When I whistle, you go now."
424.639,426.15,Are you going to admit that you stole it
426.16,428.79,"or cheated on? What? The cup? No, we"
428.8,430.55,didn't. You filled up your cup. No one
430.56,432.469,said we couldn't do that. At some point
432.479,433.67,"in the night, I'm going to blow this"
433.68,435.27,whistle and a security guard is going to
435.28,437.51,come and seek them. And if they get
437.52,439.909,"busted, they automatically have to leave"
439.919,442.07,"the water park right away. So, we'll"
442.08,443.99,wait and see what happens. This is for
444.0,446.07,them to start the tiebreaker. Here we
448.479,452.95,All right. Hold on. Hold on.
452.96,454.23,Now I think both cups are going to be
454.24,460.23,like completely empty. 3 2 1
462.12,466.07,"no, the doll. Yours is complete."
466.08,472.629,Oh my god.
472.639,481.469,Oh no. And of course they cheated again.
481.479,483.39,What? They
483.4,488.55,don't stop. Stop. Freeze.
488.56,490.71,I would like a rematch because all the
490.72,492.79,times I've gone backwards. I can't hold
492.8,494.629,it and go backwards. When you're going
494.639,496.07,"forwards, you can just hold the cup."
496.08,497.189,You're not allowed to put your hand on
497.199,499.909,the cup. But he did. Did he really? Yes.
499.919,502.07,We got to do it again. Are you kidding
502.08,504.55,me? How many ways can you guys cheat?
504.56,506.629,"Hey guys, can we stop cheating so we can"
506.639,508.71,stop riding it? He's cheating just as
508.72,510.95,much as me. You can't refill it. You
510.96,513.75,can't put your hand over the top and you
513.76,515.11,can't knock the water out of each
515.12,516.709,other's hands. You just got to hold the
516.719,518.63,thing and see who can hold it better.
518.64,520.31,That's all this is about. We should be
520.32,521.909,done with this. I'm going to go whistle
521.919,526.23,for the third time.
526.24,530.55,Here we go. Third time's a charm.
530.56,533.19,"I don't want to be backwards. No, no,"
533.2,535.15,"no, no, no, no, no. Why are you coming"
535.16,538.43,"here? No, no, no,"
538.44,542.15,no. Oh my god. I think they're both
542.16,552.31,going to go.
552.32,554.55,Wait a second. What do you have? Let's
554.56,557.59,see it.
559.2,564.55,wait. Wait. Let me see. Oh. Oh. Okay.
564.56,568.389,"Nadal has more, but it's obviously empty"
568.399,570.63,"because there's no blue dye in it. So,"
570.64,572.79,Salish with her very little wins the
574.56,576.63,Yeah. Sish. I'm feeling like a loser
576.64,578.79,right now cuz I just lost the round.
578.8,579.829,"That's kind of sad. I mean, you're going"
579.839,582.23,"to have to sleep on mattresses, I guess."
582.24,584.79,Wait. But it's not over yet. Okay. It's
584.8,586.79,not. Sure. It's just getting started.
586.8,588.949,Okay. Salish and Nadal have a beautiful
588.959,591.829,friendship that has lasted for years.
591.839,594.07,And the one thing that's always brought
594.08,597.67,"them together is ice cream. Yep, that's"
597.68,600.07,right. These kids just love ice cream.
600.08,602.15,"So, the next challenge is build me an"
602.16,603.99,ice cream sundae. You have 5 minutes.
604.0,605.269,Each of you have to make an ice cream
605.279,607.35,sundae. I will taste them and decide
607.36,608.55,which one is better. And that person
608.56,612.389,wins that round. 1 2 3 go.
612.399,615.269,I did it. Oh my gosh. You did not need
615.279,616.79,the back one. For those of you who don't
616.8,619.11,"know, this is Gigi Nadal's sister. Wow."
619.12,620.71,Was she introducing me as that? Sandy
620.72,623.389,shower when we first
623.399,626.79,met. That is so cute.
626.8,628.63,While Sailor and Nadal are making ice
628.64,630.15,"cream, EG is going to hide somewhere in"
630.16,631.67,this water park. Whoever finds her first
631.68,633.03,"wins that round. Guys, this is so cool."
633.04,634.63,I literally have a water park all myself
634.64,636.829,to hide in. What if I hid inside the
636.839,639.03,tubes? Getting caught in this would be
639.04,641.59,an actual nightmare. A few moments
641.6,643.59,later. I'm kind of stuck. I'm not going
643.6,644.87,"to lie. All right. Well, have fun. I'm"
644.88,645.91,"going down. Wait, wait, wait. I'm going"
645.92,647.59,to need help. We're going to go one
647.6,648.87,scoop of chocolate and we're going to
648.88,650.87,use strawberry. Sailor should be able to
650.88,652.87,win this round. I like mint chip with
652.88,654.87,chocolate fudge. That's my thing. This
654.88,658.79,"is my Sunday, guys. Let's try."
658.8,660.55,"He likes mint chip, but I didn't see the"
660.56,663.43,mint chip.
663.44,664.79,Did you lick it? I'm going to tell him
664.8,666.23,that you licked it. Cuz I definitely
666.24,670.47,didn't lick it. There's a skin. What?
670.48,671.829,You know what? Forget Jordan. I just
671.839,673.509,"made this for myself. So, I'm just going"
673.519,674.87,to make a whole separate one. I'm going
674.88,676.55,to keep this to myself. Loki has a good
676.56,678.23,idea for me to make my dad one. I only
678.24,679.59,have a couple minutes to find a hiding
679.6,680.87,spot because their next challenge is
680.88,682.15,going to be finding me. What about a
682.16,685.11,trash can? Uh- uh. It smells too bad in
685.12,687.11,there. Looks like Gigi found the cabana.
687.12,688.55,"But hey, get out of there. Go to a"
688.56,689.509,different spot. I'm going to check out
689.519,691.509,the last hiding spot that I think might
691.519,693.67,"be the one. Oh, this. Wait, is it about"
693.68,694.949,a flip? I think this is the last place
694.959,696.23,they will ever look for me. And they're
696.24,698.15,"going to come soon. So, I'm going to get"
698.16,700.389,down. Let's go back and check in on
700.399,702.949,Salish and Nadal with my ice cream. I'm
702.959,705.509,"done. Oh yeah, I think he loves gummy"
705.519,707.11,"bears. You know, you know my dad really"
707.12,708.55,"loves gummy bears. I do too, but I'm not"
708.56,709.75,going to put them. I think I just made a
709.76,711.91,masterpiece. Look at that. Thank you.
711.92,713.59,"I'm I'm done. Me, too. Don't forget, the"
713.6,715.269,"next time I blow this whistle, a"
715.279,716.71,security guard comes in and they've got
716.72,718.31,"to hide from it. Come on. No, you're in"
718.32,719.99,there. Or they get one step closer to
720.0,721.67,sleeping under a waterfall. You should
721.68,723.03,"win this, Alish. We have ice cream"
723.04,724.389,"together like twice a week. No, you"
724.399,725.91,don't. I'm going to judge which one I
725.92,727.35,"like better, and that person wins this"
727.36,728.87,"round. From the looks of it, I'm not"
728.88,731.269,sure I want either of these cones. Gummy
731.279,732.71,bear. Not my favorite. What did you guys
732.72,734.069,do? Eat for 4 and a half minutes and
734.079,735.829,then spend 30 seconds making these ice
738.12,741.509,"Oh, sorbet. I'm going to give this. Is"
741.519,744.069,"that you, Sish? Sish wins this round."
744.079,745.59,"Why would you put gummies? You know, I"
745.6,747.03,hate those. It was just like a last
747.04,748.79,second thing. I think he loves gummy
748.8,750.71,bears. Can you zoom in on that face?
750.72,751.99,That's the face of a guy who's sleeping
752.0,754.15,under a waterfall. Salish just won the
754.16,755.75,"ice cream challenge, but if you think"
755.76,758.23,"she deserves even more wins, she's"
758.24,760.629,actually nominated for female creator of
760.639,762.87,the year at the Kids Choice Awards.
762.88,764.71,You've watched her win challenge after
764.72,766.15,challenge. She's basically turned
766.16,768.87,beating me into a full-time job. It's so
768.88,771.03,obvious. Let's show the world how strong
771.04,773.59,team Salish really is. Link in the
773.6,775.67,"description. And yes, you can vote more"
775.68,777.11,than one. While you were making ice
777.12,779.509,"cream, your sister Gigi was hiding"
779.519,781.509,somewhere in this water park. Whichever
781.519,783.99,one of you finds her wins this round.
784.0,789.19,Are you ready? Go. Let's go. 1 2 3.
789.2,790.71,"Okay, they're coming for me. I heard the"
790.72,792.47,whistle go off. GG was probably hide
792.48,794.71,like in the cabana. I think Ging does
794.72,796.71,the stupidest hiding spots. You see her?
796.72,798.55,"No. I don't want to point, but Gigi is"
798.56,800.069,right behind me. I saw her run back
800.079,802.949,there. Both of them are over there. This
802.959,804.87,"is not Bro, I need to stay here"
804.88,806.55,overnight and wait. I'm going to steal a
806.56,807.99,piece of bubble real quick. It's been a
808.0,809.67,"long day, guys."
809.68,811.35,"Where are you at all? What's up, bud?"
811.36,812.71,"Oh, what the heck? We're going to keep"
812.72,813.99,doing this until they find her. Let's
814.0,815.509,just get in the slide. They better start
815.519,817.99,looking for Gigi or I might get bored
818.0,821.11,and have to send in the security guard.
821.12,822.87,"How is this finding Gigi? It's not. No,"
822.88,824.15,water slide is so much harder to slide
824.16,826.87,down with hot water.
826.88,829.75,Where is she? I'm coming for you. I bet
829.76,832.55,you she's in or she's underwater. This
834.8,836.15,They're on the other side of the park
836.16,837.59,right now. I can hear them screaming.
837.6,839.75,They're never going to find me again.
839.76,842.629,"Ooh, stand. Let's go back to finding"
842.639,844.31,her. I'm bumping away. If you were a
844.32,845.509,"teenage girl by her side, where would"
845.519,846.87,you hide? She was jumping somewhere over
846.88,849.11,"there. Salish. Nadal, come here. You"
849.12,850.389,"checked everywhere. Nadal, check"
850.399,851.75,everybody. I'm going to narrow the
851.76,853.03,playing field. You have to check for
853.04,856.31,Gigi in the kitty pool area. Oh my god.
856.32,857.91,I know where she is. Oh my god. I just
857.92,859.43,gave it away to see who won. Come on.
859.44,862.55,"Come on, Gigi. I hear Zo screaming right"
862.56,864.069,now. They're super close to me.
864.079,867.269,"Remember, you have to tag Gigi to win"
867.279,868.949,this challenge. Doesn't look like Sailor
868.959,871.67,heard me. Where would you be?
871.68,874.069,Sailish is so close to me. I'm going to
874.079,876.55,find her.
876.56,877.99,Oh my god. I think Sailor is about to
878.0,879.77,win this whole thing.
885.199,886.629,Either one of them could win right now.
886.639,887.91,And they're both looking in the bin. I'm
887.92,889.43,going to just stay as still as possible.
889.44,890.31,"All right, let's check if there's one"
890.32,891.509,right here. I'm sitting up right now and
891.519,893.509,"I think S's just right here. No, no, no,"
895.279,898.47,"I got one. Wait,"
898.48,901.03,I found her. I tagged your I tagged her.
901.04,902.79,"I tagged her. No, I found her. Did you"
902.8,904.389,"not hear what Jordan said? Remember, you"
904.399,908.23,have to tag Gigi to win this challenge.
908.24,910.87,Did you tag her? No.
910.88,914.71,Nad wins this challenge. That was Neo
914.72,917.189,got the he was a nice person and decided
917.199,918.949,he wanted the waterfall so I could have
918.959,920.71,the He's allowed to do that. But guess
920.72,923.189,"what? I'm not a nice person. Remember,"
923.199,924.87,the security guard can come at any time.
924.88,926.47,"If I go like this, the security guard"
926.48,929.03,comes. Next challenge.
929.04,931.03,Even though Salish and Nadal are all
931.04,933.67,"alone, locked inside the water park, the"
933.68,936.31,rest of Great Wolf Lodge is filled with
936.32,938.629,people who want to join them. I just
938.639,941.189,might let them all in as part of an epic
941.199,944.15,final hideandsek if the score is tied at
944.16,945.99,the very end. Here we go. Ready? Nope.
946.0,948.47,"Just standing here for fun. Nell, has"
948.48,953.03,"she gotten sassier? Yeah, right. Next."
953.04,955.11,Don't talk. These aren't uncomfortable.
955.12,957.35,They're not loving the goggles. Okay.
957.36,959.59,Okay. Next challenge. Wave pool. We've
959.6,962.47,thrown 24 rings into the pool and they
962.48,964.87,have 5 minutes. Whoever collects more
964.88,967.269,"wins and in the last minute, waves are"
967.279,968.389,going to start going and it's going to
968.399,971.59,be a lot harder. 1 2 3 go. Say hurry.
971.6,974.79,Go. Hurry. Say
974.8,976.79,the last time Salish and Nadal were in a
976.8,981.069,"wave pool, this happened."
981.079,984.31,Everybody knows. They still haven't
984.32,989.749,forgiven me for that prank.
989.759,991.509,We have lifeguards on each side to make
991.519,995.11,sure they're safe.
995.12,998.389,1 2 3 4 5 Looks like Nadal has the early
998.399,1001.55,"lead, but I have no idea what's going"
1001.56,1005.11,on. Salish has a bunch. Nadal has what I
1005.12,1008.23,"think is more, but I can't tell."
1008.24,1010.389,This thing is a very close competition.
1010.399,1012.23,"And don't forget, I can blow this at any"
1012.24,1013.509,time and the security guard will come
1013.519,1015.03,"and bust them. Sandy, should I do it"
1015.04,1019.11,right now?
1019.12,1023.309,You hear that? The waves are
1023.319,1025.429,starting now. They got to deal with the
1025.439,1028.27,waves. This is getting
1028.28,1032.15,harder. Hurry up. 20 seconds. Oh no. Got
1032.16,1034.35,way more
1034.36,1039.189,"time. Sish, you count first. Okay. 1 2 3"
1039.199,1046.549,4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
1046.559,1052.39,1 2 3 4 5 Yeah.
1052.4,1056.87,"Yes. Oh, Sage wins another round."
1056.88,1058.63,Remember the last time Sish tried that
1058.64,1061.029,crazy freef fall line? I think you can
1061.039,1062.71,do it on your own. I need you all up
1062.72,1064.87,here to support me. I'm here and I need
1064.88,1066.07,you all. We're going to do that again
1066.08,1067.99,tonight. Will Salish be able to do it
1068.0,1070.39,alone or will she need Nadal to give her
1070.4,1072.31,the courage? Pretty soon I am going to
1072.32,1073.909,blow this whistle for the security
1073.919,1076.39,"guard. And when I do, if he finds them"
1076.4,1078.31,"hiding, they are eliminated from this"
1078.32,1080.31,challenge and they automatically have to
1080.32,1081.43,leave the water park. They don't get to
1081.44,1082.47,stay the night. They don't get to do all
1082.48,1083.99,the rides. They are done. Next
1084.0,1086.39,"challenge, lily pad race. Salish has"
1086.4,1088.87,"red, Nadal has blue. You have 60 seconds"
1088.88,1091.11,to cross the lily pad and dump your
1091.12,1092.95,colored ball into the bucket. Whoever
1092.96,1094.789,gets more balls automatically wins this
1094.799,1098.43,"challenge. One, two,"
1098.44,1103.95,"three. Hurry up, guys. Oh. Oh. Okay."
1103.96,1106.47,"Hurry. Oh, no. He dropped his ball."
1106.48,1109.83,"Dish, come back. You can go again. Oh."
1109.84,1114.47,"Oh, no. Losing it. Hurry. 30 seconds. S."
1115.48,1117.82,"Hurry. Oh, no."
1119.12,1122.07,"No. She can do that. Hurry, S. Sish. You"
1122.08,1126.549,got 20 seconds. Go. Hurry.
1126.559,1129.43,Hurry. You got 15 seconds. You better
1129.44,1135.51,just go. Go. Hurry. Say 10 9 8 seven Oh
1135.52,1137.99,no. Five.
1138.0,1141.19,3 2 1 It's all over. How many balls are
1141.2,1143.43,in the bucket?
1143.44,1144.71,Taylor told me I wasn't going to be able
1144.72,1147.99,to win another round. So
1148.0,1149.669,she wants to play tag just to feel like
1149.679,1151.43,"she got some sort of win, but she still"
1151.44,1153.19,"hasn't tagged me yet. No, she's she's a"
1153.2,1154.72,double loser.
1159.76,1162.31,Tag him.
1162.32,1164.31,"All right, guys. I lost and I'm a little"
1164.32,1165.83,"hurt, but I'm even more hurt that I"
1165.84,1167.43,can't catch him in tag. If you watched
1167.44,1169.51,"that challenge, you already know that"
1169.52,1171.909,"Nadal easily won that round. Dude,"
1171.919,1174.07,"Salish, what happened? You got two"
1174.08,1175.669,things. Look at that. The doll's only
1175.679,1177.909,down by one. Now that they're soaking
1177.919,1180.63,"wet, Salish and Nadal want to prank Gigi"
1180.64,1183.83,before the next challenge.
1183.84,1186.07,And a cold wet hug is the best way to do
1188.32,1190.71,"GG. No, not at all. Next round,"
1190.72,1192.47,thumbnails. I'm going to do a thumbnail
1192.48,1193.75,of them. And whoever makes the better
1193.76,1195.909,"thumbnail expression judged by me, wins"
1195.919,1197.669,this round. And it's been about 6 days
1197.679,1199.11,"since I've done this, so I'm a little"
1199.12,1203.909,"rusty. Literally, every week I go,"
1203.919,1206.71,"kind of true. Tired thumbnail face. One,"
1206.72,1208.35,"two, three."
1208.36,1210.71,Tired. This is Salish's thumbnail
1210.72,1213.27,expression. That's my tired one. There
1213.28,1214.99,we go. There we go. That's it. You're
1215.0,1217.27,"tired. Sus, you open your eyes. Nadal,"
1217.28,1219.029,you close them. I'm probably going to
1219.039,1220.39,"give it to Nadal, but I'm going to give"
1220.4,1222.07,them another chance. You guys are happy
1222.08,1223.43,now. All right. Ready? Look back over at
1223.44,1225.669,"me, guys. Yeah. Big excitement. Nadal,"
1225.679,1227.029,"you smile. Sish, you're like, ""Oh my"
1227.039,1230.07,"god."" Go there. Yeah. Wa! They both"
1230.08,1232.31,killed them. Get that photo. That's good
1232.32,1234.31,stuff. Is this bringing back memories
1234.32,1236.95,"for anyone else? Because for me, this is"
1236.96,1239.029,just like it used to be. Water park
1239.039,1240.71,challenge and photo shoot. That's
1240.72,1242.149,basically all we did when they were
1242.159,1243.83,younger. And one more time. Look excited
1243.84,1246.95,now. You guys are happy. Yeah. Hold on.
1246.96,1248.63,Yeah. Now both of you get your heads in
1248.64,1250.789,"there. Nadal, you go. Shush. You look"
1250.799,1253.51,more scared. Say good. Now you're both
1253.52,1255.07,happy. Arms
1255.08,1257.83,out. Good. Good. That's it. The winner
1257.84,1260.07,of this thumbnail round is You're the
1260.08,1262.23,only boy I don't want holding my hand.
1262.24,1263.75,"So, every boy in the world can hold your"
1263.76,1265.59,hand but me. real fast. Show all the
1265.6,1267.75,"photos. Obviously, the thumbnail"
1267.76,1270.27,expression winner goes
1270.28,1274.149,to a tie. It's a tie. They both did
1274.159,1277.19,great. Thanks. Moving on. Next
1277.2,1278.95,"challenge, beach ball race. You guys"
1278.96,1280.71,have to do a full circle around the
1280.72,1282.71,water park. Whoever gets back here first
1282.72,1285.75,"wins this challenge. 1 2 3 go. Wait, how"
1285.76,1287.75,do I know which way? Go that way. Go
1287.76,1290.23,that way. Wait. Around around the whole
1290.24,1295.34,"thing. Yeah, I guess so."
1297.76,1299.51,"See, he's way ahead of you. Oh my gosh,"
1299.52,1301.83,Cohen. I'm aware. As soon as they finish
1301.84,1303.43,"this race, I'm going to blow the whistle"
1303.44,1305.029,and they will realize they have 1 minute
1305.039,1306.87,to hide.
1306.88,1308.789,"No, now you got to go that way. You got"
1308.799,1311.029,"to go that way. Sailors, catch up."
1311.039,1312.95,Hurry. Say you're going to lose. Hurry
1312.96,1315.51,"up. Okay. No, I can't push any faster."
1315.52,1317.99,You got to win.
1318.0,1320.47,"Colin, help her. I can't do it. Nadal"
1320.48,1322.63,won. Sish lost the drive. He's giving up
1322.64,1323.99,"right now. So, I'm just going to call"
1324.0,1325.789,this for Nadal and
1325.799,1330.07,go. Security guard in 1 minute. Security
1330.08,1332.31,guard in 1 minute. We've tied. We've
1332.32,1334.149,died. We've died. The security guard is
1334.159,1336.23,coming in 1 minute. You have to hide
1336.24,1338.549,"together. If you get caught, you are"
1338.559,1340.39,kicked out of the water park. And you
1340.4,1341.99,don't get to stay here overnight. You
1342.0,1343.35,have one minute. Better find a good
1343.36,1345.43,place to hide. Salish and Nadal are all
1345.44,1348.07,tied up with one round to go unless they
1348.08,1350.07,get caught by the security guard right
1350.08,1352.47,now and have to leave the water park. We
1352.48,1355.029,"can hide under the water. No. No, it's"
1355.039,1357.11,"freezing. No. Yeah, it's freezing. And a"
1357.12,1362.789,slide. No. Yeah.
1362.799,1365.11,Okay. Your nose is No. Yeah. Is this
1368.0,1370.07,What about in the towels? In those ones.
1370.08,1372.07,Those ones are the clean ones in here. I
1372.08,1375.029,got an idea.
1375.039,1378.23,"No way. This could work. Oh, wait. Guys,"
1378.24,1379.669,hurry up. You don't have much more time.
1379.679,1382.07,"Thank you, Orie. Are you guys crazy? Are"
1382.08,1383.669,you going to go behind that? All he has
1383.679,1386.07,"to do is pull it out. Okay, he's my boy."
1386.08,1387.43,"Look at this, guys. He's going to be"
1387.44,1389.59,here in 15 seconds. You better hurry up.
1389.6,1391.669,He is a security guard. He should be
1391.679,1392.95,able to find them. This isn't that great
1392.96,1394.31,a hiding spot. What do you guys think?
1394.32,1396.23,"Wait, that's enough. Say there's 10"
1396.24,1397.43,seconds. I'm going to get him right now.
1397.44,1400.149,You better hurry. Thank you. Now I'm
1400.159,1402.23,about to unleash the world's meanest
1402.24,1404.63,security guard. Salish and Nadal better
1404.64,1406.549,hope he doesn't find them and kick them
1406.559,1408.39,"out of the water park. Matt, are you"
1408.4,1409.99,ready? Ready. I'm going to find them.
1410.0,1411.59,I'm exhausted. If you can find them
1411.6,1412.789,"right now, I get to get out of here. All"
1412.799,1413.99,right. Ready? Let's do it. Let's do it.
1414.0,1415.51,"Okay, guys. I think we're doing pretty"
1415.52,1416.549,well. Yeah. I don't think he's ever
1416.559,1417.99,going to find us. Me either. I got to
1418.0,1419.43,"give him like 15 more seconds. No, no,"
1419.44,1420.99,no. Let's go. Come
1421.0,1424.71,on. Get me out. Let me out of here. All
1424.72,1427.43,"right. Never mind. He's going, I guess."
1427.44,1430.149,He's intense. Where are you? He's got 5
1430.159,1432.47,minutes to find Salish and Nadal. If
1432.48,1434.63,"they get caught, he's going to throw"
1434.64,1436.39,"them out of the park. Yeah, I know"
1436.4,1441.35,"you're in there, huh?"
1441.36,1451.43,We got the right guy.
1451.44,1454.63,Oh my god.
1454.64,1456.149,Are you kidding me? He just leapt right
1456.159,1458.31,over the telein.
1458.32,1460.549,Come out wherever you are. You got 4
1460.559,1462.789,"minutes, Mac. Come on, guys. He was"
1462.799,1464.47,right there. What? Did you hear that?
1464.48,1466.31,"Yeah, we saw him. Oh my god. We could"
1466.32,1467.43,"hear him, bro. I don't think they're"
1467.44,1468.47,going to find us. I don't even know.
1468.48,1471.269,There's like a really hiding.
1471.279,1476.909,Come on. I know you were in
1476.919,1479.43,there. Is it intense? I wouldn't want
1479.44,1482.07,him looking for me. I know you're in
1482.08,1484.95,"here. I hope he's not nearby, but I"
1484.96,1487.43,don't think he is.
1487.44,1489.269,"If this doesn't end right now, they have"
1489.279,1490.95,one more final challenge for the
1490.96,1493.19,tiebreaker to see who is sleeping in the
1493.2,1497.43,cabana and who's under the waterfall.
1497.44,1499.43,I'm going to find you. I swear. 2
1499.44,1501.669,"minutes, man."
1501.679,1503.11,"Okay, guys. He's really far away"
1503.12,1504.549,"apparently. So, I think we're going to"
1504.559,1508.31,win. Where are you guys?
1508.32,1510.31,"One minute, Matt. Oh, I think he's"
1513.44,1516.789,I don't know what you think.
1516.799,1519.59,Get up. He's never going to jump. Yeah.
1519.6,1520.95,"I mean, who would check behind the"
1524.64,1528.23,"30 seconds. Matt, where are you guys?"
1528.24,1534.71,This is really scary. Come on.
1536.919,1544.11,seconds. 5 4 3 2 1 Oh my
1544.12,1549.99,god. We won. I knew it.
1550.0,1553.269,"We were right. No way. Good job, Noodle."
1553.279,1555.51,High five. You're an intense security
1555.52,1557.51,"guard, but couldn't find the kids. I was"
1557.52,1559.43,not expecting him to not find us. That
1559.44,1560.95,was crazy. Time for your final
1560.96,1562.95,challenge. The final challenge to see
1562.96,1564.71,who gets the cabana and who gets the
1564.72,1567.029,waterfall is the freef fall. If you guys
1567.039,1568.83,"have done this right before, it is"
1568.84,1570.789,"terrifying. So, the challenge is"
1570.799,1572.789,whichever one of them makes less of an
1572.799,1575.59,"expression wins. So, if somebody goes uh"
1575.6,1577.59,they lose. How you guys doing? You want
1577.6,1579.11,to go together? Don't push the wrong
1579.12,1581.269,"button. Oh, no. Are they allowed to go"
1581.279,1582.87,"at the same time? No, of course not. I'm"
1582.88,1583.99,"excited. I want to do this. Oh, guys,"
1584.0,1585.35,"it's going to be fun, but I don't like"
1585.36,1586.87,the drop part. I don't like not knowing
1586.88,1588.39,when I'm going to drop. Which one of you
1588.4,1590.07,"wants to go first? Now, remember, the"
1590.08,1591.75,"last time you did this, you needed Nadal"
1591.76,1593.51,with you. I need a doll up here to
1593.52,1595.75,support me. I'm here and I need a doll.
1595.76,1598.149,"So, if you go first, he'll be here. But"
1598.159,1600.31,"if you let the doll go first, you got to"
1600.32,1602.149,be all alone.
1602.159,1603.59,All with me. Can I go first? No. All
1603.6,1604.47,"right. Rock, paper, scissors. We're"
1604.48,1605.43,"going to play a game of rock, paper,"
1605.44,1609.269,scissors. Whoever wins gets to go first.
1609.279,1611.35,"I hate you so much. Wait, whoever wins"
1611.36,1612.87,"gets to go first. Hey, you get to go"
1612.88,1614.87,"first. Oh, wait. I ordered that wrong."
1614.88,1616.19,Hold on. Hold
1616.2,1618.39,on. Does that mean I have to go first?
1618.4,1621.19,Yep. It's only a scary job for three
1621.2,1623.59,"seconds of my 80 years. All right, let's"
1623.6,1625.669,"go. Sing too much of a chicken, so I'm"
1625.679,1626.71,just going to go first. I need to
1626.72,1628.07,motivate her. I need to give her
1628.08,1629.83,courage. And I'm going to show her that
1629.84,1632.07,it's light work. Go first. You don't
1632.08,1634.31,want to go. The biggest challenge is
1634.32,1636.39,they have no idea when the drop will be
1636.4,1638.71,triggered. It is super hard not to react
1638.72,1640.95,when the floor suddenly drops out from
1640.96,1643.029,"beneath you. Come on, Neo. You got this."
1644.36,1648.31,Explosing. Uh-oh. Let's go. Nadal has no
1648.32,1649.59,idea when it's going to actually
1649.6,1651.99,release. All right. Come on. You got it.
1652.0,1653.59,"Let's go. Are you scared? Oh, he's"
1653.6,1656.39,scared. Lucky. It might be right now.
1656.4,1659.029,The rain is crazy.
1659.039,1663.909,It might be in 3 2 1. You never know.
1663.919,1665.51,"Let's watch this. Oh, I know it's"
1672.159,1682.389,I knew it.
1682.399,1684.63,Really? That was a piece of cake. I made
1684.64,1686.549,the straightest face I've ever made in
1686.559,1689.19,"my life. I was like, we're going to have"
1689.2,1690.31,to replay that and see what kind of
1690.32,1691.75,expression he made. I definitely think I
1691.76,1693.029,won this challenge and I'm definitely
1693.039,1694.389,sleeping in the cabana. I am not letting
1694.399,1695.99,"Sailor take it over. All right, Sish,"
1696.0,1698.149,"your turn,"
1698.159,1700.789,guys. I'm actually so scared. Oh my
1700.799,1702.149,"gosh. Okay, sis, you don't have to do"
1702.159,1704.149,this. You can just give the cabana to N.
1704.159,1706.149,"Are you sure? Yes. All right, let's do"
1713.84,1715.43,She's going to be stressing out. This is
1715.44,1728.149,too long.
1728.159,1733.59,Okay. How's your reaction?
1733.6,1737.59,I did it.
1737.6,1739.75,Did I make an expression reaction? That
1739.76,1741.99,was so scary. You got a reaction? I
1742.0,1743.269,don't know. Oh my god. That was the
1743.279,1744.549,scariest thing I've ever done. Let's go
1744.559,1746.149,"find out one. Earlier in the evening,"
1746.159,1748.47,"Nadal, Gigi, and Sish played Who Knows"
1748.48,1749.909,Me Better. Cut the cameras. Cut the
1749.919,1752.47,cameras. Then Nadal gave Salish a really
1752.48,1754.389,sweet gift. See that on the doll's
1754.399,1756.47,channel when this competition is over.
1756.48,1758.47,"Okay, guys. I for sure lost because I"
1758.48,1760.149,"mean, you were talking in the middle."
1760.159,1761.59,"You're like, I know she's going to do it"
1761.6,1764.31,right now. You win. I was just
1764.32,1765.909,screaming. I don't know if I made a
1765.919,1767.669,"reaction. I tried not to, but I think I"
1767.679,1770.389,"forgot. No, you screamed the whole time."
1770.399,1771.909,Yeah. I thought it was only at the top
1771.919,1773.669,that we didn't make a reaction. Yeah.
1773.679,1775.99,"No. Oh my gosh, bro. I was like, I did"
1776.0,1778.35,"it, guys. I did"
1778.36,1781.35,it. Oh my gosh. It's okay. Needle will
1781.36,1784.47,give me the cabana like a gentleman.
1784.48,1786.95,I see prime. I see gummies. I see root
1786.96,1788.549,beer. I'll bring you over somewhere.
1788.559,1789.83,You're getting dumped into the water. Is
1789.84,1791.19,"that a promise? Yes. All right, take the"
1791.2,1794.389,cabana. Psych. What? Now we see who made
1794.399,1796.789,a bigger expression because that person
1796.799,1799.35,loses and they are sleeping under the
1799.36,1803.83,waterfall. Look at your face.
1803.84,1806.95,"I'm scared. Oh,"
1806.96,1810.07,that's definitely a reaction.
1810.08,1812.71,Straight face. He's smiling. That's a
1816.0,1820.95,"Oh, that's a straight face."
1820.96,1823.83,Dang it. Dang. He got you. He got you.
1823.84,1825.909,We reviewed the footage. Since the rules
1825.919,1828.149,"were no expression, we have to give this"
1828.159,1830.87,entire challenge and this cabana to
1830.88,1835.669,Nidal Wonder. Yes. I am a reaction. He
1835.679,1838.149,was smiling. You were like more
1838.159,1841.19,expressive. That's tough. Here's your
1841.2,1843.19,blanket. Enjoy this sish. You got to
1843.2,1845.23,sleep under the waterfall.
1845.24,1847.669,No. Next time. I hate you. That's so
1850.399,1852.47,My name's Kane. oversee park operations
1852.48,1856.07,and I got each of you a luxury suite.
1856.08,1858.389,"Really? Yeah. Let's go. Come on, y'all."
1858.399,1859.99,Let's go. Thank you so much. Did they
1860.0,1862.149,get rooms? They got a room each. That's
1862.159,1863.51,so cool. Thank you. What about me? Did
1863.52,1865.75,"you give me one? We're sold out. Sorry,"
1865.76,1870.58,but um the cabana is all yours.
1871.919,1874.549,"Guys, can you turn the lights on? Help,"
1874.559,1876.669,guys. I can't see
1876.679,1880.559,"anything, guys."
