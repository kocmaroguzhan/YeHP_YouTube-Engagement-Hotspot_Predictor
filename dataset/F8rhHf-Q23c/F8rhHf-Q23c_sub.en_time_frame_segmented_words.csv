260,265,"here we go . 2 seconds . She 's made it 5 seconds . Okay , S , get"
265,270,back down there . Give her a little time .
270,275,"Okay , that 's my girl . This might not be too easy"
275,280,for you to know . Oh . Oh . Oh .
280,285,One arm . Can you do that ?
285,290,As good as yours . Really quick . Really
290,295,quick . 30 seconds . Hold on .
295,300,Oh no .
300,305,Oh no . No . 44 . At
305,310,"least for the obvious , Nadal Wonder won that round . Tish , I"
310,315,"hope if we ever do a video like this next time . Well , it 's okay because we still have a lot more challenges that I"
315,320,"'m going to win on . I do n't think you want to . Yeah , I 'm going to win on all of the future challenges . They say that"
320,325,because they do n't know what is about to happen . Just reminding you that this guy can show up
325,330,"at any moment . Next challenge , howling tornado . These cups are both filled with"
330,335,water . The winner has to keep the water in their cup until they reach the end of the ride .
335,340,Whoever spills more of it loses . Are you ready ? There we go . You 're going to get
340,345,pushed down once I do this . And they 're one step
345,350,closer to sleeping under a waterfall . But that cabana is sick . I 've been
350,355,wanting to win really hard . Here we
355,360,My
360,365,"guess is going to lose this round . Oh , I saw the spill from it"
365,370,"off . Oh my Oh , the water 's already"
370,375,fully spilled out
375,380,by now . I do n't I do n't know . I saw some spill . What was
380,385,"that ? Hey , wait . Neither of them won . And we are going to have to redo that"
385,390,"challenge because as I discovered later , they both cheated . I I saw"
390,395,that . I saw that . I
395,400,have a very weird feeling they both filled their cups up on
400,405,"the way down . In case it was n't obvious , you 're not allowed to fill"
405,410,"your cup up . Oh , so I put colored water . So now we know if you"
410,415,"fill it up . No , that 's it . Actually , I forgot to mention that they are not"
415,420,"allowed to cover the top of the cup with their hands , but I think they 'll be fine . Here you"
420,425,"go . Do n't spill . Here we go . Are you ready ? Yeah . When I whistle , you go now . Are you"
425,430,"going to admit that you stole it or cheated on ? What ? The cup ? No , we did n't . You filled up"
430,435,"your cup . No one said we could n't do that . At some point in the night , I 'm going to blow this whistle and a security guard is"
435,440,"going to come and seek them . And if they get busted , they automatically have to leave"
440,445,"the water park right away . So , we 'll wait and see what happens . This is for them to start the"
445,450,tiebreaker . Here we All
450,455,right . Hold on . Hold on . Now I think both cups are going to be
455,460,like completely empty . 3 2 1
460,465,"no , the doll . Yours is"
465,470,complete . Oh my
470,475,god . Oh no . And
475,480,of course they cheated again .
480,485,What ? They do n't
485,490,stop . Stop . Freeze . I would like a rematch
490,495,because all the times I 've gone backwards . I ca n't hold it and go backwards . When you 're going
495,500,"forwards , you can just hold the cup . You 're not allowed to put your hand on the cup . But he did . Did he really ? Yes ."
500,505,We got to do it again . Are you kidding me ? How many ways can you guys cheat ? Hey
505,510,"guys , can we stop cheating so we can stop riding it ? He 's cheating just as much as me . You ca"
510,515,n't refill it . You ca n't put your hand over the top and you ca n't knock the water out of
515,520,each other 's hands . You just got to hold the thing and see who can hold it better . That 's all this is about . We
520,525,should be done with this . I 'm going to go whistle for the
525,530,third time . Here we go . Third time 's a
530,535,"charm . I do n't want to be backwards . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . Why are you"
535,540,"coming here ? No , no , no , no . Oh my god . I"
540,545,think they 're both
545,550,going to go .
550,555,Wait a second . What do you have ? Let 's
555,560,see it .
560,565,wait . Wait . Let me see . Oh . Oh . Okay .
565,570,"Nadal has more , but it 's obviously empty because there 's no blue"
570,575,"dye in it . So , Salish with her very little wins the Yeah ."
575,580,"Sish . I 'm feeling like a loser right now cuz I just lost the round . That 's kind of sad . I mean , you 're going to"
580,585,"have to sleep on mattresses , I guess . Wait . But it 's not over yet . Okay . It 's"
585,590,not . Sure . It 's just getting started . Okay . Salish and Nadal have a beautiful friendship
590,595,that has lasted for years . And the one thing that 's always brought them
595,600,"together is ice cream . Yep , that 's right . These kids just love ice"
600,605,"cream . So , the next challenge is build me an ice cream sundae . You have 5 minutes . Each of you have to make an"
605,610,ice cream sundae . I will taste them and decide which one is better . And that person wins
610,615,that round . 1 2 3 go . I did it . Oh my gosh . You did not
615,620,"need the back one . For those of you who do n't know , this is Gigi Nadal 's sister . Wow . Was she"
620,625,introducing me as that ? Sandy shower when we first met . That
625,630,"is so cute . While Sailor and Nadal are making ice cream , EG is going to hide"
630,635,"somewhere in this water park . Whoever finds her first wins that round . Guys , this is so cool . I literally have a water park all myself to"
635,640,hide in . What if I hid inside the tubes ? Getting caught in this would be an actual
640,645,"nightmare . A few moments later . I 'm kind of stuck . I 'm not going to lie . All right . Well , have fun . I 'm"
645,650,"going down . Wait , wait , wait . I 'm going to need help . We 're going to go one scoop of chocolate and we 're going to use strawberry ."
650,655,Sailor should be able to win this round . I like mint chip with chocolate fudge . That 's my thing . This
655,660,"is my Sunday , guys . Let 's try . He likes mint chip , but I"
660,665,did n't see the mint chip . Did you lick it ? I 'm going to tell him that
665,670,you licked it . Cuz I definitely did n't lick it . There 's a skin .
670,675,"What ? You know what ? Forget Jordan . I just made this for myself . So , I 'm just going to make a whole separate one . I 'm going to"
675,680,keep this to myself . Loki has a good idea for me to make my dad one . I only have a couple minutes to find a hiding spot
680,685,because their next challenge is going to be finding me . What about a trash can ? Uh- uh . It smells too bad
685,690,"in there . Looks like Gigi found the cabana . But hey , get out of there . Go to a different spot . I 'm going to check out the last"
690,695,"hiding spot that I think might be the one . Oh , this . Wait , is it about a flip ? I think this is the last place"
695,700,"they will ever look for me . And they 're going to come soon . So , I 'm going to get down . Let 's go back and"
700,705,"check in on Salish and Nadal with my ice cream . I 'm done . Oh yeah , I think he"
705,710,"loves gummy bears . You know , you know my dad really loves gummy bears . I do too , but I 'm not going to put them . I think I just made a"
710,715,"masterpiece . Look at that . Thank you . I 'm I 'm done . Me , too . Do n't forget , the next time I blow this"
715,720,"whistle , a security guard comes in and they 've got to hide from it . Come on . No , you 're in there . Or they get one step closer to"
720,725,"sleeping under a waterfall . You should sleeping under a waterfall . You should win this , Alish . We have ice cream together like twice a week . No , you do n't . I 'm"
725,730,"going to judge which one I like better , and that person wins this round . From the looks of it , I 'm not sure I want either"
730,735,of these cones . Gummy bear . Not my favorite . What did you guys do ? Eat for 4 and a half minutes and then spend 30
735,740,"seconds making these ice Oh , sorbet . I 'm"
740,745,"going to give this . Is that you , Sish ? Sish wins this round . Why would you put"
745,750,"gummies ? You know , I hate those . It was just like a last second thing . I think he loves gummy bears . Can you zoom"
750,755,in on that face ? That 's the face of a guy who 's sleeping under a waterfall . Salish just won the ice cream
755,760,"challenge , but if you think she deserves even more wins , she 's actually nominated for"
760,765,female creator of the year at the Kids Choice Awards . You 've watched her win challenge after
765,770,challenge . She 's basically turned beating me into a full - time job . It 's so obvious . Let 's show
770,775,"the world how strong team Salish really is . Link in the description . And yes , you"
775,780,"can vote more than one . While you were making ice cream , your sister Gigi was hiding"
780,785,somewhere in this water park . Whichever one of you finds her wins this round . Are
785,790,"you ready ? Go . Let 's go . 1 2 3 . Okay , they 're"
790,795,coming for me . I heard the whistle go off . GG was probably hide like in the cabana . I think Ging does the
795,800,"stupidest hiding spots . You see her ? No . I do n't want to point , but Gigi is right behind me . I saw her run"
800,805,"back there . Both of them are over there . This is not Bro , I need to stay here"
805,810,"overnight and wait . I 'm going to steal a piece of bubble real quick . It 's been a long day , guys . Where"
810,815,"are you at all ? What 's up , bud ? Oh , what the heck ? We 're going to keep doing this until they find her . Let 's just get in the slide . They"
815,820,better start looking for Gigi or I might get bored and have to send in the
820,825,"security guard . How is this finding Gigi ? It 's not . No , water slide is so much harder to slide down"
825,830,with hot water . Where is she ? I 'm coming for you . I bet
830,835,you she 's in or she 's underwater . This They
835,840,'re on the other side of the park right now . I can hear them screaming . They 're never going to find me again .
840,845,"Ooh , stand . Let 's go back to finding her . I 'm bumping away . If you were a teenage girl by her"
845,850,"side , where would you hide ? She was jumping somewhere over there . Salish . Nadal , come here . You checked everywhere ."
850,855,"Nadal , check everybody . I 'm going to narrow the playing field . You have to check for Gigi in the kitty"
855,860,pool area . Oh my god . I know where she is . Oh my god . I just gave it away to see who won . Come on . Come
860,865,"on , Gigi . I hear Zo screaming right now . They 're super close to me . Remember ,"
865,870,you have to tag Gigi to win this challenge . Does n't look like Sailor heard me .
870,875,Where would you be ? Sailish is so close to me . I 'm going to
875,880,find her . Oh my god . I think Sailor is about to win this whole thing .
885,890,"Either one of them could win right now . And they 're both looking in the bin . I 'm going to just stay as still as possible . All right , let 's check"
890,895,"if there 's one right here . I 'm sitting up right now and I think S 's just right here . No , no , no ,"
895,900,"I got one . Wait , I found her . I tagged"
900,905,"your I tagged her . I tagged her . No , I found her . Did you not hear what Jordan said ? Remember , you have"
905,910,to tag Gigi to win this challenge . Did you tag
910,915,her ? No . Nad wins this challenge . That was Neo got
915,920,the he was a nice person and decided he wanted the waterfall so I could have the He 's allowed to
920,925,"do that . But guess what ? I 'm not a nice person . Remember , the security guard can come at any time . If"
925,930,"I go like this , the security guard comes . Next challenge . Even though"
930,935,"Salish and Nadal are all alone , locked inside the water park , the rest of Great Wolf"
935,940,Lodge is filled with people who want to join them . I just might let them all
940,945,in as part of an epic final hideandsek if the score is tied at the very end .
945,950,"Here we go . Ready ? Nope . Just standing here for fun . Nell , has she gotten"
950,955,"sassier ? Yeah , right . Next . Do n't talk . These are n't"
955,960,uncomfortable . They 're not loving the goggles . Okay . Okay . Next challenge . Wave pool . We 've
960,965,thrown 24 rings into the pool and they have 5 minutes . Whoever collects more
965,970,"wins and in the last minute , waves are going to start going and it 's going to be a lot harder ."
970,975,1 2 3 go . Say hurry . Go . Hurry . Say the
975,980,"last time Salish and Nadal were in a wave pool , this"
980,985,happened . Everybody knows . They still have n't
985,990,forgiven me for that prank . We
990,995,have lifeguards on each side to make sure they 're
995,1000,"safe . 1 2 3 4 5 Looks like Nadal has the early lead , but I have no"
1000,1005,idea what 's going on . Salish has a bunch . Nadal has what
1005,1010,"I think is more , but I ca n't tell . This thing is a very close"
1010,1015,"competition . And do n't forget , I can blow this at any time and the security guard will come and bust them . Sandy , should I do"
1015,1020,it right now ? You
1020,1025,hear that ? The waves are starting now . They got to deal
1025,1030,with the waves . This is getting harder . Hurry
1030,1035,up . 20 seconds . Oh no . Got way more
1035,1040,"time . Sish , you count first . Okay . 1 2 3 4"
1040,1045,5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
1045,1050,1 2 3 4 5
1050,1055,"Yeah . Yes . Oh , Sage wins"
1055,1060,another round . Remember the last time Sish tried that crazy freef fall
1060,1065,line ? I think you can do it on your own . I need you all up here to support me . I 'm here and I need
1065,1070,you all . We 're going to do that again tonight . Will Salish be able to do it alone or will she need Nadal to
1070,1075,give her the courage ? Pretty soon I am going to blow this whistle for the security guard . And when
1075,1080,"I do , if he finds them hiding , they are eliminated from this challenge and they automatically"
1080,1085,"have to leave the water park . They do n't get to stay the night . They do n't get to do all the rides . They are done . Next challenge ,"
1085,1090,"lily pad race . Salish has red , Nadal has blue . You have 60 seconds to cross the lily"
1090,1095,pad and dump your colored ball into the bucket . Whoever gets more balls automatically wins this
1095,1100,"challenge . One , two , three ."
1100,1105,"Hurry up , guys . Oh . Oh . Okay . Hurry . Oh , no ."
1105,1110,"He dropped his ball . Dish , come back . You can go again . Oh ."

1140,1145,many balls are in the bucket ? Taylor told me I was n't going to be able
1145,1150,to win another round . So she wants to play tag just to feel like she
1150,1155,"got some sort of win , but she still has n't tagged me yet . No , she 's she 's a double loser ."
1160,1165,"Tag him . All right , guys . I lost and I 'm a little hurt , but I 'm"
1165,1170,"even more hurt that I ca n't catch him in tag . If you watched that challenge , you already know that Nadal"
1170,1175,"easily won that round . Dude , Salish , what happened ? You got two things . Look at that ."
1175,1180,"The doll 's only down by one . Now that they 're soaking wet , Salish and Nadal want to"
1180,1185,prank Gigi before the next challenge . And a cold wet hug
1185,1190,"is the best way to do GG . No , not at all ."
1190,1195,"Next round , thumbnails . I 'm going to do a thumbnail of them . And whoever makes the better thumbnail expression"
1195,1200,"judged by me , wins this round . And it 's been about 6 days since I 've done this , so I 'm a little"

1560,1565,Time for your final challenge . The final challenge to see who gets the cabana and who gets the
1565,1570,"waterfall is the freef fall . If you guys have done this right before , it is terrifying . So , the"
1570,1575,"challenge is whichever one of them makes less of an expression wins . So , if"
1575,1580,"somebody goes uh they lose . How you guys doing ? You want to go together ? Do n't push the wrong button . Oh , no ."
1580,1585,"Are they allowed to go at the same time ? No , of course not . I 'm excited . I want to do this . Oh , guys , it 's going to be fun , but I"
1585,1590,"do n't like the drop part . I do n't like not knowing when I 'm going to drop . Which one of you wants to go first ? Now , remember ,"
1590,1595,"the last time you did this , you needed Nadal with you . I need a doll up here to support me . I 'm here and"
1595,1600,"I need a doll . So , if you go first , he 'll be here . But if you let the doll go first , you"

1615,1620,Hold on . Hold on . Does that mean I have to go first ? Yep . It 's only a
1620,1625,"scary job for three seconds of my 80 years . All right , let 's go . Sing too much of a"
1625,1630,"chicken , so I 'm just going to go first . I need to motivate her . I need to give her courage . And I 'm going to show her that it"
1630,1635,'s light work . Go first . You do n't want to go . The biggest challenge is they have no
1635,1640,idea when the drop will be triggered . It is super hard not to react when the floor
1640,1645,"suddenly drops out from beneath you . Come on , Neo . You got this ."
1645,1650,Explosing . Uh - oh . Let 's go . Nadal has no idea when it 's going to actually
1650,1655,"release . All right . Come on . You got it . Let 's go . Are you scared ? Oh , he 's scared . Lucky . It"
1655,1660,might be right now . The rain is crazy . It

1685,1690,"straightest face I 've ever made in my life . I was like , we 're going to have to replay that and see"
1690,1695,what kind of expression he made . I definitely think I won this challenge and I 'm definitely sleeping in the cabana . I am not letting Sailor take
1695,1700,"it over . All right , Sish , your turn , guys . I 'm actually so"
1700,1705,"scared . Oh my gosh . Okay , sis , you do n't have to do this . You can just give the cabana to N. Are you sure ?"

1740,1745,was so scary . You got a reaction ? I do n't know . Oh my god . That was the scariest thing I 've ever done . Let 's go find out
1745,1750,"one . Earlier in the evening , Nadal , Gigi , and Sish played Who Knows Me Better . Cut the cameras . Cut the"
1750,1755,cameras . Then Nadal gave Salish a really sweet gift . See that on the doll 's channel

1790,1795,"that a promise ? Yes . All right , take the cabana . Psych . What ? Now we see who made a bigger"
1795,1800,expression because that person loses and they are sleeping under the
