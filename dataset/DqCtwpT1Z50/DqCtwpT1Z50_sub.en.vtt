spends their money the best? That's so
 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.990 align:start position:0%
spends their money the best? That's so
subjective.<00:02:38.560><c> Well,</c><00:02:38.720><c> I'm</c><00:02:38.959><c> basing</c><00:02:39.280><c> it</c><00:02:39.440><c> on</c><00:02:39.760><c> three</c>

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
subjective. Well, I'm basing it on three
 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.390 align:start position:0%
subjective. Well, I'm basing it on three
things.<00:02:40.400><c> Generosity,</c><00:02:41.200><c> fun,</c><00:02:41.519><c> and</c><00:02:41.760><c> creativity.</c>

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
things. Generosity, fun, and creativity.
 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.830 align:start position:0%
things. Generosity, fun, and creativity.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
So, I think this is going to go at
 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.350 align:start position:0%
So, I think this is going to go at
probably<00:02:44.239><c> number</c><00:02:44.480><c> one</c><00:02:44.720><c> cuz</c><00:02:44.879><c> it's</c><00:02:45.040><c> the</c><00:02:45.200><c> only</c>

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
probably number one cuz it's the only
 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.270 align:start position:0%
probably number one cuz it's the only
one<00:02:45.519><c> I</c><00:02:45.680><c> have.</c><00:02:46.000><c> Oh,</c><00:02:46.319><c> and</c><00:02:46.480><c> he</c><00:02:46.640><c> looks</c><00:02:46.879><c> really</c><00:02:47.040><c> cute</c>

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.510 align:start position:0%
did a video in his school, and he was

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
one of the classmates, and he's really
 

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.269 align:start position:0%
one of the classmates, and he's really
nice.<00:24:37.919><c> So,</c><00:24:38.159><c> let's</c><00:24:38.320><c> see</c><00:24:38.480><c> if</c><00:24:38.559><c> he</c><00:24:38.720><c> does</c><00:24:38.960><c> something</c>

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
nice. So, let's see if he does something
 

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:41.190 align:start position:0%
nice. So, let's see if he does something
generous,<00:24:39.760><c> something</c><00:24:40.159><c> funny,</c><00:24:40.480><c> and</c><00:24:40.720><c> creative.</c>

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
generous, something funny, and creative.
 

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.230 align:start position:0%
generous, something funny, and creative.
Let's<00:24:41.360><c> go</c><00:24:41.520><c> get</c><00:24:41.600><c> some</c><00:24:41.760><c> energy</c><00:24:42.080><c> drinks.</c>

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
Let's go get some energy drinks.
 

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.470 align:start position:0%
Let's go get some energy drinks.
So,<00:24:44.400><c> we</c><00:24:44.559><c> went</c><00:24:44.720><c> to</c><00:24:44.799><c> CVS</c><00:24:45.279><c> and</c><00:24:45.440><c> go</c><00:24:45.600><c> to</c><00:24:45.679><c> Celsius.</c><00:24:46.240><c> I</c>

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
So, we went to CVS and go to Celsius. I
 

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.710 align:start position:0%
So, we went to CVS and go to Celsius. I
mean,<00:24:46.720><c> energy,</c><00:24:47.360><c> that's</c><00:24:47.679><c> fun.</c><00:24:48.159><c> I</c><00:24:48.400><c> didn't</c><00:24:48.559><c> got</c>

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
mean, energy, that's fun. I didn't got
 

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.710 align:start position:0%
mean, energy, that's fun. I didn't got
like<00:24:48.880><c> so</c><00:24:49.039><c> many</c><00:24:49.200><c> Celsiuses.</c><00:24:49.919><c> So,</c><00:24:50.080><c> I</c><00:24:50.240><c> stole</c><00:24:50.480><c> one</c>

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
like so many Celsiuses. So, I stole one
 

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.789 align:start position:0%
like so many Celsiuses. So, I stole one
of<00:24:50.799><c> his</c><00:24:51.039><c> Celsiuses</c><00:24:51.760><c> and</c><00:24:52.000><c> I</c><00:24:52.240><c> gave</c><00:24:52.400><c> it</c><00:24:52.480><c> to</c><00:24:52.640><c> my</c>

00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
of his Celsiuses and I gave it to my
 

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:54.950 align:start position:0%
of his Celsiuses and I gave it to my
friends<00:24:53.360><c> and</c><00:24:53.840><c> I</c><00:24:54.080><c> was</c><00:24:54.159><c> really</c><00:24:54.400><c> nice</c><00:24:54.559><c> and</c><00:24:54.720><c> they</c>

were<00:24:55.039><c> really</c><00:24:55.279><c> happy.</c><00:24:55.679><c> So,</c><00:24:55.919><c> get</c><00:24:56.159><c> Celsius,</c><00:24:56.799><c> give</c>

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
were really happy. So, get Celsius, give
 

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.310 align:start position:0%
were really happy. So, get Celsius, give
it<00:24:57.039><c> to</c><00:24:57.200><c> your</c><00:24:57.360><c> friends</c><00:24:57.600><c> because</c><00:24:57.840><c> it's</c><00:24:58.080><c> really</c>

00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
nice. Kids don't drink Celsius if you're
 

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:01.830 align:start position:0%
nice. Kids don't drink Celsius if you're
under<00:25:00.400><c> what,</c><00:25:00.640><c> like</c><00:25:00.880><c> 15,</c><00:25:01.200><c> right?</c><00:25:01.360><c> Like</c><00:25:01.520><c> Sailor</c>

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
under what, like 15, right? Like Sailor
 

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.269 align:start position:0%
under what, like 15, right? Like Sailor
doesn't<00:25:02.000><c> drink</c><00:25:02.159><c> Celsius.</c><00:25:02.640><c> So,</c><00:25:02.799><c> that's</c><00:25:03.039><c> good.</c>

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't drink Celsius. So, that's good.
 

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:05.110 align:start position:0%
doesn't drink Celsius. So, that's good.
So,<00:25:03.440><c> I</c><00:25:03.600><c> got</c><00:25:03.679><c> my</c><00:25:03.840><c> energy</c><00:25:04.159><c> drink</c><00:25:04.480><c> right</c><00:25:04.640><c> here.</c>

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
So, I got my energy drink right here.
 

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.470 align:start position:0%
So, I got my energy drink right here.
And<00:25:05.279><c> I</c><00:25:05.520><c> was</c><00:25:05.600><c> thinking</c><00:25:05.760><c> about</c><00:25:05.919><c> it.</c><00:25:06.240><c> There's</c><00:25:06.400><c> a</c>

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
And I was thinking about it. There's a
 

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.350 align:start position:0%
And I was thinking about it. There's a
lot<00:25:06.559><c> of</c><00:25:06.640><c> things</c><00:25:06.799><c> we</c><00:25:06.960><c> could</c><00:25:07.039><c> do</c><00:25:07.120><c> with</c><00:25:07.200><c> this</c>

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
lot of things we could do with this
 

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.390 align:start position:0%
lot of things we could do with this
money.<00:25:07.600><c> We</c><00:25:07.760><c> might</c><00:25:07.840><c> as</c><00:25:08.000><c> well</c><00:25:08.159><c> do</c><00:25:08.240><c> some</c>

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
money. We might as well do some
 

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.750 align:start position:0%
money. We might as well do some
charitable<00:25:08.799><c> things</c><00:25:08.960><c> with</c><00:25:09.120><c> it.</c><00:25:09.440><c> There's</c><00:25:09.600><c> a</c>

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
charitable things with it. There's a
 

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.909 align:start position:0%
charitable things with it. There's a

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
great paw shelter nearby. And I figured
 

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:13.269 align:start position:0%
great paw shelter nearby. And I figured
we<00:25:12.159><c> could</c><00:25:12.240><c> get</c><00:25:12.400><c> some</c><00:25:12.559><c> stuff</c><00:25:12.720><c> for</c><00:25:12.880><c> them.</c><00:25:13.200><c> So,</c>

00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
we could get some stuff for them. So,
 

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:15.029 align:start position:0%
we could get some stuff for them. So,
now<00:25:13.440><c> we're</c><00:25:13.520><c> here</c><00:25:13.600><c> in</c><00:25:13.760><c> the</c><00:25:13.840><c> dog</c><00:25:14.000><c> aisle</c><00:25:14.320><c> and</c>

00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
now we're here in the dog aisle and
 

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:18.149 align:start position:0%
now we're here in the dog aisle and
there's<00:25:15.200><c> a</c><00:25:15.720><c> list</c><00:25:16.720><c> that</c><00:25:16.880><c> they</c><00:25:17.120><c> have.</c>

there's a list that they have.
 

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:19.350 align:start position:0%
there's a list that they have.
Now<00:25:18.320><c> we're</c><00:25:18.480><c> just</c><00:25:18.559><c> going</c><00:25:18.640><c> to</c><00:25:18.720><c> fill</c><00:25:18.880><c> it</c><00:25:19.039><c> out.</c>

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
Now we're just going to fill it out.
 

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.269 align:start position:0%
Now we're just going to fill it out.
Wait,<00:25:19.760><c> he's</c><00:25:20.000><c> in</c><00:25:20.240><c> like</c><00:25:20.400><c> a</c><00:25:20.559><c> pet</c><00:25:20.799><c> store</c><00:25:21.039><c> and</c>

everyone was just in a pet store. So
 

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:29.470 align:start position:0%
everyone was just in a pet store. So
maybe<00:25:23.120><c> they're</c><00:25:23.360><c> doing</c><00:25:23.600><c> the</c><00:25:23.840><c> same</c><00:25:23.919><c> thing</c><00:25:25.000><c> for</c>

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
pet food. So now we got the cat food and
 

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.390 align:start position:0%
pet food. So now we got the cat food and
dog<00:25:34.080><c> food.</c><00:25:34.799><c> Now</c><00:25:35.520><c> it's</c><00:25:35.760><c> on</c><00:25:35.919><c> the</c><00:25:36.000><c> way</c><00:25:36.080><c> to</c><00:25:36.240><c> the</c>

dog food. Now it's on the way to the
shelter.<00:25:36.960><c> We</c><00:25:37.200><c> spent</c>

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
shelter. We spent
 

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.029 align:start position:0%
shelter. We spent
$136,<00:25:39.760><c> which</c><00:25:40.000><c> means</c><00:25:40.159><c> that</c><00:25:40.320><c> there's</c><00:25:40.559><c> still</c><00:25:40.799><c> a</c>

00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
$136, which means that there's still a
 

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.990 align:start position:0%
$136, which means that there's still a
lot<00:25:41.120><c> of</c><00:25:41.279><c> money</c><00:25:41.440><c> left.</c><00:25:42.080><c> They</c><00:25:42.240><c> spent</c>

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
lot of money left. They spent
 

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.350 align:start position:0%
lot of money left. They spent
$136<00:25:44.000><c> and</c><00:25:44.320><c> they</c><00:25:44.480><c> have</c><00:25:44.559><c> a</c><00:25:44.720><c> lot</c><00:25:44.799><c> of</c><00:25:44.960><c> money</c><00:25:45.120><c> that</c>

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
$136 and they have a lot of money that
 

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.789 align:start position:0%
$136 and they have a lot of money that
they<00:25:45.520><c> can</c><00:25:45.760><c> spend.</c><00:25:46.000><c> So,</c><00:25:46.159><c> let's</c><00:25:46.400><c> see</c><00:25:46.480><c> if</c><00:25:46.640><c> we</c>

00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
they can spend. So, let's see if we
