1460,1465,"sweet . So , she might go to number two . Uh , move these people down . I 'm sorry , but guys , that"
1465,1470,"was really sweet . Paint , I miss you , but let 's do this . I do n't know how to spend this much money . It 's hard to think"
1470,1475,"about . Jim is 17 . I met him from when we about . Jim is 17 . I met him from when we did a video in his school ,"
1475,1480,"and he was one of the classmates , and he 's really nice . So , let 's see if he does something generous ,"
1480,1485,"something funny , and creative . Let 's go get some energy drinks . So , we went"
1485,1490,"to CVS and go to Celsius . I mean , energy , that 's fun . I did n't got like so many Celsiuses ."
1490,1495,"So , I stole one of his Celsiuses and I gave it to my friends and I was really nice and they"
1495,1500,"were really happy . So , get Celsius , give it to your friends because it 's really nice . Kids do n't drink Celsius if you"
1500,1505,"'re under what , like 15 , right ? Like Sailor does n't drink Celsius . So , that 's good . So , I got my energy drink right"
1505,1510,here . And I was thinking about it . There 's a lot of things we could do with this money . We might as well do some charitable things with it . There 's a
1510,1515,"great paw shelter nearby . And I figured we could get some stuff for them . So , now we 're here in the dog aisle"
1515,1520,"and there 's a list that they have . Now we 're just going to fill it out . Wait , he 's"
1520,1525,in like a pet store and everyone was just in a pet store . So maybe they
1525,1530,'re doing the same thing for puppies .
1530,1535,Last one . He 's getting a lot of pet food . So now we got the cat food and dog food . Now it
1535,1540,"'s on the way to the shelter . We spent $ 136 , which means"
1540,1545,that there 's still a lot of money left . They spent $ 136 and they have a lot of
1545,1550,"money that they can spend . So , let 's see if we spend it on anything else . Now , we 're finally here at the Paw Shelter . Let 's"
1550,1555,drop off our goods .
1555,1560,"Oh , they 're dropping it off to a shelter"
1560,1565,just like Emry did . That 's so cute .
1565,1570,"Oh , make sure to check out your local animal shelter and help them out when you can . A"
1570,1575,"Gio donated animals , too . Okay , this is that 's going to be a tough choice for her . We 's"
1575,1580,"already up high on the leaderboard . Now I have to put Gio there , too . But spending money makes you really ,"
1580,1585,"really , really hungry . You can go Shake Shack , a burger . I mean , okay . Yeah ,"
1585,1590,"I was thinking about it . What 's another way to go spend money ? Concert tickets , cuz"
1590,1595,they 're kind of expensive and it 's a great way to get an experience out of it . Since there 's this great band playing
1595,1600,"soon , called the Maria , I will get tickets . And I 'm super excited . Oh , he 's going to a"
1600,1605,"concert , so he 's getting an outfit . Every good concert needs a"
1605,1610,good outfit .

1625,1630,"he 's having fun . He 's got two out of three . He went to a concert , so that 's really"
1630,1635,fun . And he got stuff for pets and that 's really cute . I got a burger and a Celsius .
1635,1640,"Gio also has to be number one . So , he also gets to be number one . Sus , you have to pick"
1640,1645,"one person . Number one , I know . So , you one person . Number one , I know . So , you just going to It 's like half the board . We"

1655,1660,"she 's really sweet . I met them at the Kids Choice Awards and they were all really nice . So , let 's see"
1660,1665,"what they buy . Guys , I think what we need to do is go to the pet store and buy a cat . Oh , they 're"
1665,1670,going to the pet store and buy a cat . Do you think Sally is more of a cat girl or a dog girl ? Look at this cute
1670,1675,"definitely a dog . S you 're a dog person , are n't you ? Hey , Dad . Can we go to a dog shelter and buy a dog ?"

1690,1695,"spending money cuz I 'm not 18 . Sockie is . Well , I guess they did n't get the cat . This is where I 'm spending my"
1695,1700,money first at a very futuristic sushi place . They even have like a train on the
1700,1705,"tracks . How cool . When we were in Singapore , we went to sushi restaurant and they had like a train thing"
1705,1710,and this kid was putting his hands in it before like it got delivered to the person . It was
1710,1715,really funny . E. Yeah . I am planning to spend $ 100 on this sushi train and we 're going to help us
