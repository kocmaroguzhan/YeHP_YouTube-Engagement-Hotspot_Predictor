2.399,5.749,"credit card to ages 1 through 18. Wait,"
5.759,7.749,"no, we're using your credit card. What?"
7.759,9.35,"No, we always do. Let's use yours this"
9.36,13.43,"time. Oh, no. And yours is unlimited."
13.44,15.91,"Today, my daughter Salish gives my"
15.92,18.63,unlimited credit card to YouTubers aged
18.64,21.75,1 through 18 to see how they spend their
21.76,23.91,money. I will watch each influencer and
23.92,25.83,decide who spends their money the best.
25.84,28.15,The winner will get whatever is in this
28.16,30.47,mystery box. Mr. security guard. Can you
30.48,32.069,please make sure that nobody touches
32.079,34.59,what's inside that box? It's really
34.6,37.51,"valuable. Okay, thank you. It seems like"
37.52,39.59,all of my friends are really good at
39.6,41.43,spending my dad's money. I guess they
41.44,43.43,learned that from me. And I don't know
43.44,45.75,if my dad is ready for that because they
45.76,48.15,have some crazy ideas planned for my
48.16,51.029,"dad's credit. Starting with age one,"
51.039,53.75,Ocean Ortiz from Familio Diamond. I'm at
53.76,55.189,"Target with my one-year-old brother,"
55.199,56.709,"Ocean, and we're going to be buying"
56.719,61.069,whatever he touches. Item number one.
61.079,65.75,Okay. He's so cute. This is $40.
65.76,68.59,Oh my gosh. She's spending $40 on a
68.6,71.51,toy. I knew it. I knew I got the right
74.159,75.91,He's spending so much money. It hasn't
75.92,78.55,even been like a minute. Enough toy
78.56,80.07,shopping. Now it's time for Ocean to
80.08,82.39,pick himself an outfit. He's so cute. We
82.4,83.91,"found the perfect outfit, guys. And he's"
83.92,86.469,"running again. Wait, that looks exactly"
86.479,88.55,"like what my dad wore. Wait, what video"
88.56,90.469,"is that? No rules. Okay. Yeah, he looked"
90.479,92.069,really stupid. But I bet Ocean would
92.079,93.83,look really cute. He's walking like he
93.84,95.19,knows where he's going. He's going back
95.2,96.63,"to the toy section, which is good"
96.64,98.31,because that's the most expensive
98.32,100.23,"section, so he knows what he's doing. He"
100.24,102.069,"really likes this toy. Oh, this one,"
102.079,105.27,"too. Okay, that's $40. I'm glad it's not"
105.28,107.35,my credit card.
107.36,109.91,"All right. No, Dad. Ocean is spending so"
109.92,111.19,much of your money. How much money is
111.2,112.789,"you spending? Oh, Dad. This is my thing,"
112.799,114.55,Dad. I can't watch. Let me watch. It's
114.56,117.35,my money. It's my money.
117.36,119.67,It's not going to fit.
119.68,122.069,We have spent $500 and safe to say he
122.079,124.23,"had the best day of his life. Yeah, they"
124.24,126.87,for sure spent $500 and he looks so
126.88,128.79,happy. I'm going to use this board to
128.8,131.11,rank who spends the money the best and
131.12,133.03,whoever ends up at number one will get
133.04,135.03,"the mystery prize. So, what's in this"
135.04,137.43,"actually? Oh, what? I just want to look"
137.44,139.83,"at it. No, hold on. Is that my money"
139.84,141.75,"that we use for that? Uh, I don't know"
141.76,143.75,if it's my I spent it. Let me look. I
143.76,145.91,want to see. You mean I just want to see
145.92,148.63,the I just
148.64,152.83,"Okay, I"
152.84,154.869,"understand. Okay, you're right. You're"
154.879,156.229,right. How are you going to decide who
156.239,157.99,spends their money the best? That's so
158.0,159.99,"subjective. Well, I'm basing it on three"
160.0,162.39,"things. Generosity, fun, and creativity."
162.4,163.83,"So, I think this is going to go at"
163.84,165.35,probably number one cuz it's the only
165.36,167.27,"one I have. Oh, and he looks really cute"
167.28,168.949,and he looks like he had a lot of fun.
168.959,170.47,Okay. All right. Bye. Are they all going
170.48,172.229,to spend that much money or I don't
172.239,173.67,know. We'll see. Maybe a little more
173.68,176.47,next time.
176.48,178.79,"Oh, it's me. So, we are in front of"
178.8,181.83,Target and Jordan and Taylor got me more
181.84,184.309,"than I expected. She's so cute. Okay,"
184.319,185.91,let's see what she spends her money on.
185.92,188.07,My money. I didn't pay his money. I have
188.08,190.39,"a plan, but I want to let you guys just"
190.4,192.63,now. Okay. Is that your first item? Did
192.64,194.07,you check how much it is? I don't really
194.08,195.27,"care how much it is. Like, it's"
195.28,197.35,"basically unlimited money, right? Yeah,"
197.36,200.47,it is unlimited. I love these. Do you
200.48,203.589,even have a phone? What? How do you get
203.599,205.589,this for your phone? She's buying phone
205.599,207.35,cases and she doesn't even have a phone.
207.36,208.71,She's really trying to waste his money.
208.72,210.55,I like her. We're in the sports section.
210.56,213.03,"Hey, you don't play basketball, though."
213.04,214.789,"Okay. Well, I guess she's going to be"
214.799,216.55,playing a lot of new sports. That's
216.56,221.35,actually a soccer ball now.
221.36,222.949,We're going to get some Uno cards.
222.959,226.869,$4.99. Oh my god. Oh my god. Why are you
226.879,228.789,buying that many toys? She's dropping
228.799,230.71,all of the toys. This is all like boy
230.72,232.39,"toys. Why are you getting them? Yeah,"
232.4,233.75,you're pretty right. I should get some
233.76,235.19,girl toys. She's just getting a lot of
235.2,236.63,stuff that she's probably not even going
236.64,238.63,"to use. Salish. Dude, are you Can you"
238.64,239.91,talk to this person? They're my Door
239.92,241.589,Dash person. What am I supposed to do?
241.599,243.83,Just do whatever like they're asking.
243.84,245.429,I'm getting your Door Dash while you're
245.439,247.27,spending my money. This better be on
247.28,248.949,"your account, Salish. It better be. It"
248.959,250.869,is. I swear. I got didn't have fun
250.879,252.229,because I had a credit card for
252.239,253.91,"Postmate. Or wait, what? I had a gift"
253.92,255.91,card for Postmates and I got the
255.92,257.99,cucumber salad and the spicy noodles.
258.0,260.069,That sounds so good right now. What' you
260.079,261.83,get for me? I didn't get anything for
261.84,264.629,"you. Moving on. Yeah, let's go. Yeah,"
264.639,266.629,let's go back to spending my money. Like
266.639,268.469,your two friends who are about to do the
268.479,270.23,"most dangerous things they can imagine,"
270.24,272.469,like Nadal paragliding and Paisley
272.479,274.469,bungee jumping. And I'm the one paying
274.479,276.71,"for this madness. Oh god, this is going"
276.72,279.03,to be expensive. What is this turtle? I
279.04,280.95,"like turtles, too. Sometimes I act like"
280.96,282.87,the turtle cuz sometimes I'm slow cuz I
282.88,286.79,love bed.
286.8,289.03,I think I've seen her laugh 100 times in
289.04,295.59,"his YouTube videos. He's like,"
295.6,298.07,"she got so many things. Hey, Mimi, I"
298.08,300.23,think you overdid. I always wondered if
300.24,301.59,they're going to sell a pink Spider-Man.
301.6,303.59,"Ma, you don't even like Spider-Man. What"
303.6,305.749,"are you doing? Okay. By the way,"
305.759,307.749,"Annazala family started this trend, but"
307.759,309.51,if they had told me how expensive it
309.52,311.749,"would be, I never would have done it."
311.759,313.83,This is fun. I'll get both of them then.
313.84,315.029,I don't know you like that. What's going
315.039,316.95,on? It's not for me. Just a reminder.
316.96,318.95,Got a little hint. What do you mean it's
318.96,320.629,not for you? Don't worry about that
320.639,324.629,right now. Ta.
324.639,326.469,What should I do with all of it? I
326.479,329.27,always wanted to get the USA champion
329.28,331.51,"chips. Oh, does that mean I get to get a"
331.52,334.15,nacho chip after this? Cuz it's called a
334.16,336.469,"world record chip. It's a championship,"
336.479,340.95,"not a chip. Oh my god. Okay, we're not."
340.96,342.31,Tell me the truth. How much sugar did
342.32,343.99,you have today? had two pancakes in my
344.0,346.39,school for breakfast and some sausage
346.4,350.31,and two cups of syrup.
350.32,353.67,"Oh my gosh, my food. Yay. Thank you,"
353.68,356.15,Dad. You're ridiculous.
356.16,357.909,"Guys, my food is here. In case you're"
357.919,358.95,wondering what it's like to film with
358.96,360.629,Salish. There you go. Do you want any of
360.639,363.83,"my food? Okay, I guess not. Anyways,"
363.84,366.43,this is what I got. Here's a
366.44,369.11,mukbang. I'm so gassed. If anyone knows
369.12,371.029,"what this thing is, that white thing,"
371.039,372.79,"could you tell me? S, you want to try"
372.8,374.71,using the chopsticks in the proper way?
374.72,375.909,I think you're supposed to like take
375.919,377.51,"them apart, but I don't do that."
377.52,379.43,"Anyways, let's get back onto our video."
379.44,381.27,"Mimi, this is way too much. I don't know"
381.28,382.55,you like that. You don't know. You're
382.56,384.15,going to be proud of me after. Are we
384.16,385.909,"going to tweet or No, we're done. Let's"
385.919,388.23,go check out.
388.24,389.909,"Oh my gosh, guys. They're checking out"
389.919,391.83,right now. And that employee probably
391.84,393.59,thinks they're crazy. They have so much
393.6,396.07,stuff. Let's see.
396.08,398.87,"Oh my god, this is so exciting. Your"
398.88,400.79,"plan better be a good plan. Don't worry,"
400.8,403.189,Daddy. Oh my god. Do we have all these
403.199,406.309,left? 409.
406.319,411.27,"409. What? I mean 1,000. What? Okay. I I"
411.28,412.87,"can't watch, Colin. I can't watch. It"
412.88,415.029,"went to 10,000. Okay, now you're messing"
415.039,418.07,"with me. No, I'm not. We're at 52, guys."
418.08,420.07,There's a lot of toys. I still don't
420.08,421.189,know what we're going to do with all
421.199,423.43,these toys. My plan is to donate all of
423.44,425.749,"these to kids that need it more. Oh,"
425.759,428.309,they're donating all of them. And we are
428.319,430.95,right here in front of Hope the Mission
430.96,433.43,"donation drop off center. Wait, guys."
433.44,435.909,"That's so sweet. A good job, baby. I'm"
435.919,438.27,so proud of you.
438.28,440.71,You This might have to move up. She
440.72,442.71,"might be in first place. I mean, that's"
442.72,445.189,so cute. I'm going to put Mila at number
445.199,447.51,one because you was so generous giving
447.52,449.35,all the toys to the Boys and Girls Club.
449.36,450.469,"So, I thought that was really sweet."
450.479,451.99,That was worth my money for sure. if
452.0,453.83,somebody goes on a Sephora hole. I know
453.84,456.23,Embry loves beauty products and that's
456.24,458.469,"really expensive. So, I just hope more"
458.479,460.95,YouTubers lean towards generosity rather
460.96,463.029,than craziness because I don't know if I
463.039,465.029,can handle more people bungee jumping
465.039,467.11,out of buildings or flying off of
467.12,472.35,"mountains. Now, it's a forly bungee"
472.36,475.83,"jumping. Hi. Off topic, her eyes and her"
475.84,479.189,hair are so pretty. Oh my gosh.
479.199,481.43,I need to plan some things out. color.
481.44,483.909,"Wait, where are you going? Follow me."
483.919,485.67,"First, I'm going to write down what I"
485.68,488.15,"would spend it on. Oh, snap. I like it."
488.16,493.029,"Number two, craft a fun surprise. We"
493.039,494.95,could like set up a party for all the
494.96,496.15,"cousins. Wait, why'd you write"
496.16,498.39,"pepperoni? A pizza party? No, I like"
498.4,500.71,plain pepperoni just to eat. We did a
500.72,502.629,video once and she has such good energy
502.639,504.55,and she's so sweet. Okay. All right. You
504.56,507.029,ready to roll? Yeah. Are we going first?
507.039,509.029,"Target. Kindly, look at this split. We"
509.039,510.309,couldn't have done the shopping spree
510.319,512.23,without Kenley. They're a good combo.
512.24,514.149,"You needed a luggage for your doll, too."
514.159,516.79,"Oh, I love these."
516.8,519.509,Sold to the girl with the purple pants.
519.519,522.149,Five stars. Six stars. They're having a
522.159,523.909,shopping spree with their dad. That's
523.919,525.59,fun when you're young. Is that still
525.6,526.949,"fun? That was fun with me. No, it's so"
526.959,528.15,"fun. Okay, I guess you don't want to go"
528.16,529.35,shopping sprees with me and my credit
529.36,531.269,card anymore. I guess that's fine. Looks
531.279,534.15,"like we got a duo, ladies and gentlemen."
534.16,536.87,"Tiny glass cup. Oh, that is so perfect."
536.88,540.389,"This is so much fun. Oh,"
540.399,543.35,I think you should get 39. 39. That's
543.36,545.75,good. I'm so tempted to get a ice cream
545.76,548.71,"truck. Look at all that ice cream. Okay,"
548.72,550.55,they're getting a lot of different
550.56,552.55,stuff. There's a big variety of stuff.

554.959,557.509,"Cheers. Oh, and they're getting ice"
557.519,559.59,cream baddies. How much money have we
559.6,563.03,"spent? To be exact, it's 163. Oh my"
563.04,565.19,goodness. Look at this dresser. That is
565.2,566.389,Should we grab one for both of our
566.399,568.07,dolls? How expensive are they? art.
568.08,569.75,"It's not that expensive. Okay, now"
569.76,571.269,they're at a craft store and I guess
571.279,572.71,they're going to make crafts. That
572.72,575.43,sounds like a good idea. The little pots
575.44,582.07,and pans and the silver. It's so cute.
582.08,583.99,"Okay, I think this is good. We could"
584.0,588.15,have Robux with some road ducks. Six. I
588.16,589.67,think that's six right there. How much
589.68,591.99,"are you doing in Robux? 1,000 for"
592.0,594.389,"everyone? Yeah. That's cool of you,"

626.399,627.99,"They're so happy that they got 1,000"
628.0,630.15,"Robux. Now, I'm going to put Adley at"
630.16,632.71,number two because she was very generous
632.72,634.63,by giving some of the toys that she got
634.64,636.389,to her friends. She had a lot of fun
636.399,638.23,"getting the toys. So, that was sweet."
638.24,639.99,I'm keeping Neil at number one because
640.0,641.509,"she gave to charity, which is really"
641.519,643.03,hard to beat. This is just getting
643.04,645.11,started cuz other YouTubers are going
645.12,647.19,"nuts with the money. Okay guys, now it's"
647.2,650.23,"age 11, Mike Nostia. Hi guys. Yesterday"

656.56,658.31,Thank you very very much. Have you seen
658.32,659.829,how many subscribers she has? I think
659.839,661.99,it's like 350 million. No. Have you seen
663.6,665.35,"I know it's crazy, right? For real. For"
665.36,667.269,real. I loved her so much. I'm going to
667.279,669.509,"PetSmart to buy a hamster. Guys, she's"
669.519,671.59,getting hamsters. That's so cute. I
671.6,673.67,found the hamsters. Look at this one.
673.68,675.59,"There's three. Should I buy three, guys?"
675.6,677.59,"So, we're getting this one, a Siri, and"
677.6,680.63,two. Just a white one. All right. Thank
680.64,683.43,you. You're welcome.
683.44,686.23,"So, I got my hamster. Now, let's go to"
686.24,689.59,the mall. Let's buy something for Salish
689.6,692.069,and Jordan. I'm getting her this lip
692.079,693.99,"gloss. Maybe she has it, but oh well,"
694.0,695.75,"she's going to have to. So, now stuff"
695.76,697.91,"for Jordan. Oh, perfect. His eyes are"
697.92,700.389,always looking a little too old. For
700.399,702.389,"real. My dad does look too old. Dad, you"
702.399,704.47,need some eye patches. And this reduces
704.48,706.069,redness. I don't think this is going to
706.079,708.23,"help because his face is always red, but"
708.24,710.63,let him give it a try or something.
710.64,713.59,"Okay, I have one more thing for Jordan."
713.6,715.509,I don't think he can ride a skateboard.
715.519,717.99,He's like 99. You know how Jordan always
718.0,720.55,"wears the boring black shirt? Well,"
720.56,722.63,"we're going to change that. Oh my gosh,"
722.64,725.59,that makes sense now. Perfect. Thank you
725.6,727.75,"so much. So, like a week ago, I came"
727.76,729.75,home from school. I have a package and
729.76,731.99,"there was like a really cool shirt, but"
732.0,735.389,"now I know it was Nia. Oh, that's"
735.399,738.31,"why. Oh, she bought that for me with my"
738.32,740.389,"money. Yeah. How nice of her. Yo, do you"
740.399,741.91,want to give me my noodles back? I'm
741.92,743.59,hungry. I'll go get your noodles. You
745.36,747.35,I learned he's not very talkative. I
747.36,749.19,bought everything I need and I spended
749.2,751.03,"all my money. Thank you, Jordan and"
751.04,754.19,Salish. Bye. Now I'm going to put
754.2,756.629,Nostia. I don't know. She's kind of tied
756.639,758.949,with Ocean. She got stuff for me and
758.959,761.19,from my dad and she made a lot of old
761.2,762.71,jokes which were really funny. I think
762.72,764.629,she's going to go over here at three. I
764.639,766.069,don't know. Ocean was really cute
766.079,767.99,"though. Okay, now it's Paisley from Not"
768.0,770.23,"Enough Nelson's and she's 13. Hey sis,"
770.24,771.509,it's me Paisley from Not Enough
771.519,772.949,"Nelson's. So, I want to go bungee"
772.959,774.069,"jumping. I've never been before, but"
774.079,775.59,it's also my sister Presley's birthday.
775.6,776.949,She's never been and she's scared of
776.959,779.35,"heights. So, let's go ask her. Presley"
779.36,780.949,"doesn't like heights. So, let's see how"
780.959,783.03,"this goes. Also, that's very generous"
783.04,784.79,that she's bringing her sister. Here's
784.8,786.11,your noodles.
786.12,788.79,Yay. Thank you. They're cold and they're
788.8,791.269,"like how appealing, guys. Okay. A couple"
791.279,793.59,"days ago, I came home from gymnastics. I"
793.6,795.829,ordered a ton. And I go upstairs and I'm
795.839,797.829,bringing my dad his like you know I'm a
797.839,799.35,nice kid. I was like saying like dad
799.36,800.79,your stuff is here. Came back into my
800.8,802.629,room and I was only holding mine like
802.639,804.79,that and I dropped it and it went face
804.8,807.03,plant on my floor. So I ate it but I was
807.04,808.629,eating it off the floor. You didn't put
808.639,810.31,"a backup bowl or anything. You just No,"
810.32,811.99,"I just ate it off the floor. Guys, I'm"
812.0,814.87,not gross. I'm really like not gross.
814.88,818.23,Who would eat off the floor? Dad. Yeah.
818.24,824.87,Come here. Try a pasta I made.
824.88,827.43,"Yum. Hey, Presley. I want to go to"
827.44,829.35,Vegas. Do you want to come with me cuz
829.36,830.949,"it's like your room? All right, guys. We"
830.959,833.59,"got my mom and Cass to bring us. Wait,"
833.6,834.79,Presley. Do you see how tall that
834.8,836.47,"building is? Oh, yeah. That's really"
836.48,840.069,"tall. Yeah. Yeah, that is pretty tall."
840.079,841.99,"Wait, guys. How far are we from Utah's"
842.0,843.509,"Vegas? It's like a couple hours. Yeah,"
843.519,845.11,but a couple hours just to go bungee
845.12,847.189,"jumping. That's crazy dedication. So, I"
847.199,848.23,got you a little present for your
848.24,849.189,"birthday. So, you have to get"
849.199,851.189,"blindfolded to see it. Okay. Okay, guys."
851.199,853.829,She's getting blindfolded.
853.839,855.35,How would you feel doing this deck? Oh
855.36,857.189,my gosh. I want to do this so bad. Have
857.199,860.79,you ever been budgy jumping?
860.8,863.91,"For real. Me, too."
863.92,865.99,Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I'm
866.0,867.11,"going to show you what we're doing, but"
867.12,869.43,you can't freak out. Okay.
871.199,873.189,"Oh my gosh, guys. She looks really"
873.199,874.949,scared. I don't think she wants to do it
874.959,876.79,very much. This is my idea. I'm kind of
876.8,879.11,scared now. This is weird. Are these
879.12,881.43,objects like sway? Like is this the new
881.44,884.55,pile? Yep. I'm excited. Scared. They're
884.56,887.509,going to jump all the way from up there
887.519,889.03,all the way to here. They're literally
889.04,890.79,walking out towards the edge right now.
890.8,893.99,"Guys, that's such a far drop. Mr."
894.0,898.35,"Security Man, block"
898.36,900.87,"him. By the way, everyone's looking me."
900.88,902.55,I'm not eating this very well. But how
902.56,904.15,the heck am I supposed to eat this
905.8,908.47,"Like, whatever. Anyway, so let's keep"
908.48,909.509,"watching. All right, Presley, how are"
909.519,911.43,"you feeling tonight? Scared. Bailey, I"
911.44,914.23,"think is having Presley jump first. Two,"
914.24,919.75,"one, go."
919.76,923.629,Oh my
923.639,926.31,gosh. Oh my gosh. That was not what I
926.32,929.269,was expecting. You faced your fear. That
929.279,931.03,"was a lot funner than I was expecting,"
931.04,933.35,guys. That looks so fun. I want to do
933.36,935.43,that. I want to know what's in that. How
935.44,936.55,long does it take to drive from
936.56,939.75,California to Vegas? 3 hoursish to
939.76,941.43,"drive. Yeah, it's not far. Hey, Dad."
941.44,943.11,We're going to Vegas tomorrow. Okay.
943.12,945.03,Okay. To bungee jump. Yep. I'm not sure
945.04,946.389,"if I'm ready for that. Oh, well that"
950.24,951.91,"That would hurt. All right, Paisley, you"
951.92,954.949,are recording jump. It's Paisley's turn.
954.959,962.629,"Two, one, go."
962.639,964.55,"Good job, you guys. Thank you, Jordan,"
964.56,966.71,"for giving us that experience. Paisley,"
966.72,968.31,I think I'm going to put her three
968.32,970.79,because she was generous about helping
970.8,973.03,Presley get over her fear about heights.
973.04,975.59,And then I'll put Nostia at number four
975.6,977.509,"and Ocean at number five. I'm sorry,"
977.519,979.03,Ocean. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. Why can't
979.04,980.79,"Paisley be at two or one? I mean, she"
980.8,982.629,helped her sister conquer a fear.
982.639,984.629,Because they gave stuff to each other.
984.639,986.23,"That was like sweet, you know? You think"
986.24,987.269,toys are more important than
987.279,989.03,experiences? I think that Paisley should
989.04,991.749,"be number two. No, I think yes, but"
991.759,994.31,Adley went out with her friends and got
994.32,996.31,stuff with each other and like had fun
996.32,998.31,"with her friends, but Paisley was with"
998.32,999.99,"her sister, you know? Huh? It's just"
1000.0,1001.749,"different. If you think that was bad,"
1001.759,1003.35,wait until you see the rest of the
1003.36,1005.43,YouTubers. The Norris Nuts have a bunch
1005.44,1007.59,"of kids, so they could end up spending a"
1007.6,1009.55,lot of my money. Now
1009.56,1012.15,it's 14. I know exactly what I want to
1012.16,1014.069,spend it on. Paragliding. And the reason
1014.079,1015.189,I wanted to do this is because I'm
1015.199,1017.11,"coming to an end of my vacation and Oh,"
1017.12,1018.949,"so like I get to go too, right? We're"
1018.959,1020.79,"both using this together. Oh, and Gigi's"
1020.8,1022.23,"there. Of course, they're going parrot"
1022.24,1024.15,"lighting. Uh, guys, no, you're not."
1024.16,1025.429,"Wait. Yeah. No, no. Sorry. You can you"
1025.439,1027.35,"can go. GG's also going to needle, I"
1027.36,1029.829,"guess, which is fun. Sibling bonding. I"
1029.839,1031.11,"would have invited you to come with me,"
1031.12,1032.549,"but you're too much of a chicken, so"
1032.559,1034.87,"that's why I didn't. Hey, Needle. I"
1034.88,1037.11,would so go there. He just called me a
1037.12,1038.63,"chicken. That's me. Okay, guys. We just"
1038.64,1040.23,jumped off right now and honestly I was
1040.24,1041.909,like terrified at first but now that
1041.919,1043.59,we're up here it's actually super chill
1043.6,1045.59,and the ocean view is insane. I think
1045.6,1049.789,the doll's about to jump off
1049.799,1052.71,"soon guys. Oh my god, we just did it. Oh"
1052.72,1053.909,"my god, guys. We're so high up in the"
1053.919,1055.669,"air right now. Guys, look at this view."
1055.679,1057.75,It's absolutely crazy. Next time we
1057.76,1060.23,"should do this together. Sish, that view"
1060.24,1062.15,"is so good. Yeah, Sish, if you were with"
1062.16,1063.27,"me right now, you would have definitely"
1063.28,1065.029,bailed out cuz this is way too scary for
1065.039,1067.11,"you. Hey Needle, I would not have bailed"
1067.12,1069.11,"out. I would have gone on that. Guys, I"
1069.12,1070.549,"don't I'm lost of words right now. Like,"
1070.559,1072.71,this is so pretty. Unlike anything I've
1072.72,1073.99,ever done before. This is crazy. I don't
1074.0,1075.59,know where Gigi went to be honest. She
1075.6,1078.73,just she just flew away and disappeared.
1085.36,1087.11,I'm trying to reach and grab the top of
1087.12,1088.63,"the box and see what's inside, but this"
1088.64,1089.669,isn't long enough. I got to find
1089.679,1091.11,"something longer. Guys, I'm going rate"
1091.12,1092.63,this experience a 10 out of 10. Thank
1092.64,1094.909,"you, sis. Guys, we're landing right"
1094.919,1099.35,now. Very good. We landed. Cool. I'm
1099.36,1101.11,"safe. You heard that, guys? I'm safe. I"
1101.12,1101.83,thought I was going to die on the
1101.84,1103.35,landing right there. Yeah. I thought he
1103.36,1104.71,"was going to die, too. Now I'm going to"
1104.72,1106.549,"put Needle. Rough picture, by the way."
1106.559,1107.75,Needle. You could have picked any
1107.76,1109.19,"picture. That was your best one. Uh,"
1109.2,1110.549,"Sail, you picked that picture. Oh, I"
1110.559,1111.909,"picked that picture. Anyways, I'm going"
1111.919,1114.029,to tie him with Nela because
1114.039,1116.87,Mila just cut that part out. Mila gave
1116.88,1118.87,"to Charity, but you know, also said that"
1118.88,1121.11,"he wanted to take me next time. So,"
1121.12,1123.39,he'll move up.
1126.08,1127.99,It's just cold. Not going to cap. It's
1128.0,1129.83,Emry Courtland. Last Saturday I met her.
1129.84,1131.11,She was so sweet. We went to a
1131.12,1133.029,basketball game with like all my dad's
1133.039,1134.71,friends and everyone on the team. It was
1141.16,1143.83,"chill. Hi guys, I'm Emry Corland and I'm"
1143.84,1145.19,here with my best friend Gracie. We're
1145.2,1146.71,going to donate to the Chattahuchi
1146.72,1149.029,"Humane Society. Guys, they're donating"
1149.039,1151.11,all of their money. That's so sweet and
1151.12,1153.19,"very generous. Okay, so now we're in"
1153.2,1155.27,Petco and we're looking for the Pirina
1155.28,1157.83,"dog and cat chow, which it says is in a"
1157.84,1159.87,"green bag. So, let's see if we can find"
1159.88,1163.51,"it. Okay, so we're getting four bags of"
1163.52,1165.51,the Pyina Chow for the dogs. Hold up.
1165.52,1167.83,"Hey, don't air. They're both 14. Embry"
1167.84,1169.909,"turned 15. Salish. Oh, sorry. Must not"
1169.919,1171.27,be checking famous birthdays. If you
1171.28,1172.95,"did, you'd see I'm number one now. No,"
1172.96,1174.47,"you're not. I am. Everybody, go check it"
1174.48,1176.07,out. I'm number one. Congratulations.
1176.08,1178.789,Boom. Number one. Boost me. Boost me.
1178.799,1180.47,Don't lose him. He's just not as cool as
1180.48,1182.23,"me. Okay, bye. Has anybody heard how"
1182.24,1185.11,stuffy her nose is? Stop. Anybody got
1185.12,1186.87,good allergy medication? Comment below.
1186.88,1188.63,Ow ow ow. These are the dog and cat
1188.64,1190.15,wives. They're actually cute. What if we
1190.16,1191.51,got some ice cream and we fed it to them
1191.52,1193.11,"tomorrow? Ice cream, guys. They"
1193.12,1195.19,literally have dog ice cream. I've never
1195.2,1196.549,even heard of that before. Peanut butter
1196.559,1198.39,"and pretzel bites. Wait, that's so cute."
1198.4,1201.11,We absolutely have to get dog ice cream.
1201.12,1202.549,I got to know what's inside that box cuz
1202.559,1204.39,I bet it's super expensive and I want to
1204.4,1206.789,know before I say yes to giving it away.
1206.799,1208.15,I'm going to use this broom to go over
1208.16,1209.669,"the wall, knock off the top, and see"
1209.679,1215.19,what's inside.
1215.2,1217.83,"Oh, guys, they're doing Wait, where's"
1217.84,1219.909,"your security again? No, he's taking it"
1219.919,1223.27,"over, guys. Look at this fight. No, no,"

1228.0,1230.23,"Well, anyways, we found a lot of dog"
1230.24,1232.23,"food on clearance, and it's also for"
1232.24,1233.99,like older dogs. I guess it's easier for
1234.0,1236.07,them to eat it. We found lickable baby
1236.08,1238.31,"treats for cats. Honestly, they look"
1238.32,1240.549,"delicious. reality for myself. Guys, the"
1240.559,1243.19,lighting is lowkey gas.
1243.2,1245.029,We've gotten all the food. I think we
1245.039,1246.87,need to get some toys for them. First
1246.88,1248.71,"thing I got, tennis balls. I found this"
1248.72,1250.149,little tiny bone for like the smaller
1250.159,1251.83,"dogs, which is adorable. I got this cute"
1251.84,1253.99,little small bear. We've spent a while
1254.0,1255.35,"here, so I feel like we've got like a"
1255.36,1258.47,"bunch of things that animals, dogs, cats"
1258.48,1260.63,will love. See you guys when we get to
1260.64,1263.029,"the Humane Society. Bye. You guys,"
1263.039,1265.11,that's so cute. She got a lot of stuff
1265.12,1267.669,"for the shelter. So, that's so generous."
1267.679,1269.11,We finally made it to the humane
1269.12,1270.95,"society. Guys, so we just made it"
1270.96,1272.87,inside. There's baby kittens and they're
1272.88,1277.75,"so baby. Wait, that one's so cute. Guys,"
1277.76,1280.39,you get to hold. I want more than
1280.4,1282.39,anything to take these cats home. We're
1282.4,1283.59,trying to convince my mom right now to
1283.6,1285.35,"let me get a cat, the orange one,"
1285.36,1287.19,because it's so cute. The cats are
1287.2,1288.789,"really cute. Okay, so we're setting up"
1288.799,1290.909,the ice cream right now. It's literally
1293.48,1296.789,A super sweet. I'm literally obsessed
1296.799,1298.789,with like all these animals. Aren't you?
1298.799,1301.35,Mhm. They're so cute. I was giving it
1301.36,1303.669,the ice cream and he just like actually
1303.679,1305.59,put it on my head and started taking it
1305.6,1309.83,over there.
1309.84,1311.35,"You guys, they're giving the ice cream"
1311.36,1313.669,to the dogs. They're so cute. It was
1313.679,1315.19,actually so fun meeting like all the
1315.2,1316.95,animals. I love the fact that like Sish
1316.96,1318.47,and her dad made it possible for us to
1318.48,1320.149,"do this for them. So, thank you for"
1320.159,1322.39,everything. We love you all so much.
1322.4,1325.59,"Bye. Okay, now Embry was so sweet and"
1325.6,1328.47,she was very like generosity. I don't
1328.48,1330.07,know how to say that another way. She's
1330.08,1332.789,"very generous. So, I'm going to put her"
1332.799,1335.669,"tied or triple tied, whatever that is."
1335.679,1337.99,"At number one, this is hard. Mila and"
1338.0,1340.789,"Embry were very generous, but Nolles did"
1340.799,1342.07,"something we could do together, which"
1342.08,1343.83,would also be fun. And the surprise
1343.84,1345.669,"gift, I'll give you a hint. I could"
1345.679,1347.19,"benefit from it, too. I'm going to guess"
1347.2,1348.39,that Embry is going to win this thing
1348.4,1350.63,because Sailor loves animals. That is so
1350.64,1353.11,"cool. Okay, let's go to Payton. Payton"
1353.12,1355.27,is 16. I think she's 16. She has her
1355.28,1357.19,license. She drove me and she was a
1357.2,1359.83,"really good driver. Cap. Anyways, let's"
1359.84,1361.43,watch this. I just got the challenge and
1361.44,1363.909,I had the best idea. I'm going to buy a
1363.919,1365.83,plane to get four of my friends to come
1365.84,1368.87,to prom with me. She's here.
1368.88,1370.71,We got to go right now. Okay. Okay.
1370.72,1374.549,"Let's go. Oh, they're going to prom. Oh,"
1374.559,1381.83,"you look so cute. Oh, I love the hair."
1381.84,1384.47,"gorgeous. Oh my gosh, Payton looks so"
1384.48,1385.99,good. Her dress looks really good on
1386.0,1388.63,her. I love the dresses. She looks so
1388.64,1391.51,cute. And I am so excited. I was able to
1391.52,1393.029,bring her out to prom. I'm homeschooled
1393.039,1394.149,and I didn't have a chance to go to
1394.159,1396.149,"prom. So, this is so exciting and I'm so"
1396.159,1398.149,glad you got to come. She used her money
1398.159,1399.99,to pay for her friend to go to prom with
1400.0,1401.909,her. That's very generous. That might be
1401.919,1405.69,up there.
1419.2,1420.8,Do it.
1426.159,1427.99,"Oh, they're in the dance. That's so"
1428.0,1430.17,cute. They look so cute.
1439.44,1441.59,That's a lot more lit than my school
1441.6,1443.99,dances. My school dance was terrible.
1444.0,1446.149,It's the next day and the dance was so
1446.159,1447.83,fun. The dance was crazy. We were
1447.84,1449.27,jumping in a mosh pit. Comment down
1449.28,1450.63,below if you've ever gone to prom. I
1450.64,1451.909,feel like everyone needs to go and get
1451.919,1453.99,the prom experience. So fun. My friend
1454.0,1457.19,"Payton, now she flew somebody out so she"
1457.2,1458.71,"could go to prom with them, which I"
1458.72,1460.87,"think is really sweet. So, she might go"
1460.88,1463.19,"to number two. Uh, move these people"
1463.2,1465.11,"down. I'm sorry, but guys, that was"
1465.12,1467.269,"really sweet. Paint, I miss you, but"
1467.279,1468.71,let's do this. I don't know how to spend
1468.72,1469.99,this much money. It's hard to think
1470.0,1473.59,about. Jim is 17. I met him from when we
1473.6,1475.51,"did a video in his school, and he was"
1475.52,1477.51,"one of the classmates, and he's really"
1477.52,1479.269,"nice. So, let's see if he does something"
1479.279,1481.19,"generous, something funny, and creative."
1481.2,1484.23,Let's go get some energy drinks.
1484.24,1486.47,"So, we went to CVS and go to Celsius. I"
1486.48,1488.71,"mean, energy, that's fun. I didn't got"
1488.72,1490.71,"like so many Celsiuses. So, I stole one"
1490.72,1492.789,of his Celsiuses and I gave it to my
1492.799,1494.95,friends and I was really nice and they
1494.96,1496.95,"were really happy. So, get Celsius, give"
1496.96,1498.31,it to your friends because it's really
1498.32,1500.149,nice. Kids don't drink Celsius if you're
1500.159,1501.83,"under what, like 15, right? Like Sailor"
1501.84,1503.269,"doesn't drink Celsius. So, that's good."
1503.279,1505.11,"So, I got my energy drink right here."
1505.12,1506.47,And I was thinking about it. There's a
1506.48,1507.35,lot of things we could do with this
1507.36,1508.39,money. We might as well do some
1508.4,1509.75,charitable things with it. There's a
1509.76,1511.909,great paw shelter nearby. And I figured
1511.919,1513.269,"we could get some stuff for them. So,"
1513.279,1515.029,now we're here in the dog aisle and
1515.039,1518.149,there's a list that they have.
1518.159,1519.35,Now we're just going to fill it out.
1519.36,1521.269,"Wait, he's in like a pet store and"
1521.279,1522.95,everyone was just in a pet store. So
1522.96,1529.47,maybe they're doing the same thing for
1529.48,1531.75,puppies. Last one. He's getting a lot of
1531.76,1533.83,pet food. So now we got the cat food and
1533.84,1536.39,dog food. Now it's on the way to the
1536.4,1538.75,shelter. We spent
1538.76,1541.029,"$136, which means that there's still a"
1541.039,1542.99,lot of money left. They spent
1543.0,1545.35,$136 and they have a lot of money that
1545.36,1546.789,"they can spend. So, let's see if we"
1546.799,1548.39,"spend it on anything else. Now, we're"
1548.4,1549.59,finally here at the Paw Shelter. Let's
1549.6,1557.59,drop off our goods.
1557.6,1559.669,"Oh, they're dropping it off to a shelter"
1559.679,1565.07,just like Emry did. That's so cute.
1565.08,1567.35,"Oh, make sure to check out your local"
1567.36,1569.11,animal shelter and help them out when
1569.12,1572.23,"you can. A Gio donated animals, too."
1572.24,1573.51,"Okay, this is that's going to be a tough"
1573.52,1575.669,choice for her. We's already up high on
1575.679,1577.269,the leaderboard. Now I have to put Gio
1577.279,1578.95,"there, too. But spending money makes you"
1578.96,1581.51,"really, really, really hungry."
1581.52,1583.83,"You can go Shake Shack, a burger. I"
1583.84,1586.47,"mean, okay. Yeah, I was thinking about"
1586.48,1588.23,it. What's another way to go spend
1588.24,1590.87,"money? Concert tickets, cuz they're kind"
1590.88,1592.789,of expensive and it's a great way to get
1592.799,1594.07,an experience out of it. Since there's
1594.08,1595.59,"this great band playing soon, called the"
1595.6,1597.909,"Maria, I will get tickets. And I'm super"
1597.919,1600.149,"excited. Oh, he's going to a concert, so"
1600.159,1601.75,he's getting an outfit. Every good
1601.76,1606.55,concert needs a good outfit.
1610.0,1611.83,"Okay, that looks tough. I got a bunch of"
1611.84,1615.269,"stuff from Levis's and Tilly's. So, last"
1615.279,1618.39,"step, getting tickets. I did it. I had"
1618.4,1619.99,"successfully completed your challenge,"
1620.0,1623.029,Jordan. There it is. And now I can enjoy
1623.039,1624.95,"it. So, first he was generous and now"
1624.96,1627.11,he's having fun. He's got two out of
1627.12,1629.51,"three. He went to a concert, so that's"
1629.52,1631.59,really fun. And he got stuff for pets
1631.6,1633.19,and that's really cute.
1633.2,1635.51,I got a burger and a Celsius. Gio also
1635.52,1637.909,"has to be number one. So, he also gets"
1637.919,1639.99,"to be number one. Sus, you have to pick"
1640.0,1642.549,"one person. Number one, I know. So, you"
1642.559,1644.23,just going to It's like half the board.
1644.24,1646.71,We'll see. We'll see.
1646.72,1647.99,"I think I'm pretty much broke, but okay."
1648.0,1649.029,There's only one more. This has been
1649.039,1651.51,"rough. Hi, Legend. It's the North Nuts."
1651.52,1653.75,"Okay, that was Saki and she's with the"
1653.76,1656.23,Norris Nuts and she's really sweet. I
1656.24,1657.99,met them at the Kids Choice Awards and
1658.0,1659.83,"they were all really nice. So, let's see"
1659.84,1661.59,"what they buy. Guys, I think what we"
1661.6,1663.59,need to do is go to the pet store and
1663.6,1665.75,"buy a cat. Oh, they're going to the pet"
1665.76,1667.43,store and buy a cat. Do you think Sally
1667.44,1669.029,is more of a cat girl or a dog girl?
1669.039,1670.71,Look at this cute definitely a dog. S
1670.72,1671.99,"you're a dog person, aren't you? Hey,"
1672.0,1673.909,Dad. Can we go to a dog shelter and buy
1673.919,1677.83,"a dog? Not yet. Okay. Oh my god,"
1677.84,1680.07,"Biggiey's holding him. Guys, it's so"
1680.08,1682.63,cute. We have six kids and two dogs.
1682.64,1684.71,We've got nothing. We need more. The
1684.72,1686.389,cat's falling in love with Biggie.
1686.399,1688.47,Legends. I wish I would have got that
1688.48,1690.07,"cat. And plus, I'm not the one spending"
1690.08,1692.47,"money cuz I'm not 18. Sockie is. Well, I"
1692.48,1693.75,guess they didn't get the cat. This is
1693.76,1695.51,where I'm spending my money first at a
1695.52,1698.149,very futuristic sushi place. They even
1698.159,1700.47,have like a train on the tracks. How
1700.48,1702.47,"cool. When we were in Singapore, we went"
1702.48,1704.389,to sushi restaurant and they had like a
1704.399,1706.31,train thing and this kid was putting his
1706.32,1708.31,hands in it before like it got delivered
1708.32,1710.549,to the person. It was really funny. E.
1710.559,1713.11,Yeah. I am planning to spend $100 on
1713.12,1714.71,this sushi train and we're going to help
1714.72,1717.43,us spend it. My first plate of sushi is
1717.44,1719.909,this chicken katsu. Sabre has literally
1719.919,1723.75,"gotten a volcano of sushi. Yeah, that's"
1723.76,1725.59,good. That That's so sweet that they're
1725.6,1727.19,doing things as a family and they're all
1727.2,1729.669,together. We are also going to get a
1729.679,1731.269,dessert. Do you want to matter you're
1731.279,1733.59,going bankrupt? We're getting chocolate
1733.6,1737.11,by the bald man. Is it like
1737.12,1739.51,I love spending other people's money.
1739.52,1741.43,"It's so fun. If you ever won, we can"
1741.44,1742.789,always do like an entire video of
1742.799,1744.87,spending like maybe all your money. I
1744.88,1746.87,was thinking maxing out Jordan Madd's
1746.88,1748.63,credit card.
1748.64,1751.11,"If this video gets 10 likes, would do"
1751.12,1753.43,that video. You're from Australia and I
1753.44,1755.99,just learned a lot about Australia. It's
1756.0,1759.19,hot there and I forget everything else.
1759.2,1760.789,"All right, mate. Okay, now it's time to"
1760.799,1762.63,"spend my money on something I really,"
1762.64,1765.43,"really want. The Apple Store. Oh, now"
1765.44,1766.95,they're at the Apple store. We should
1766.96,1769.11,watch some Jordan Matter on the iPads.
1771.039,1772.87,"Subscribe to Jordan Matter. Oh, and they"
1772.88,1774.71,subscribed to Jordan Matter. They didn't
1774.72,1776.789,subscribe to Sish Matter. How did I lose
1776.799,1780.47,a point? I'm going to buy some AirPods.
1780.48,1783.35,AirPods. I just got the AirPods. Funny
1783.36,1785.19,story. The reason why I need these is
1785.2,1787.029,that I had AirPods and I dropped them
1787.039,1789.029,"down the stairs. So, I'm so happy Jord"
1789.039,1790.63,gave me so I didn't have to spend my own
1790.64,1793.669,"money. So, thank you guys. God, this is"
1793.679,1795.19,"getting expensive. All right, guys. They"
1795.2,1798.23,just got AirPods. Please pick us for the
1801.159,1804.549,Please knuckles. Saki was really sweet
1804.559,1807.35,because she hung out with all of like
1807.36,1809.59,her family and they all did things
1809.6,1812.47,together which is fun and generous that
1812.48,1814.47,she let her family come. So maybe I'll
1814.48,1816.669,put that at
1816.679,1819.909,number five. Now I have to make a
1819.919,1821.909,"decision. And before I pick my winner, I"
1821.919,1823.19,want to show you guys what's inside the
1823.2,1825.59,mystery box. Thank you so much. What's
1825.6,1829.269,"in it is $5,000. That's more money than"
1829.279,1830.87,I ever thought I could see. Look at
1830.88,1835.11,"this. What? 5,000. Oh jeez. Oh, okay."
1835.12,1837.51,"Oh, wait. Give us my money. It's my"
1837.52,1839.83,money. Look at that. There's so much
1839.84,1841.43,"money in here. Now, we got to go pick"
1841.44,1843.269,our winner. And whoever wins gets the
1843.279,1846.149,"$5,000. So, don't parasailing sounds so"
1846.159,1848.35,fun with him. But that's kind of
1848.36,1850.63,"selfish. So, I'm just going to put him"
1850.64,1852.47,right here. But I really want to go
1852.48,1854.149,parasailing with him because that sounds
1854.159,1856.31,so fun. But I don't want to be selfish.
1856.32,1858.23,"So, he'll go in number eight. Mila"
1858.24,1860.23,donated to the Boys and Girls Club.
1860.24,1862.95,Embry and Gio donated to a animal
1862.96,1864.71,shelter. They were so generous and they
1864.72,1866.63,had so much fun. I think all three of
1866.64,1868.95,"them donated to charity. So, I'm going"
1868.96,1871.19,to split the prize up and donate to the
1871.2,1873.59,same charities.
1873.6,1875.19,"Oh, actually, that's really nice. Wait,"
1875.2,1877.909,"but $5,000 though? Yeah, you'll be okay."
1877.919,1881.72,"Okay, it's for charity."
