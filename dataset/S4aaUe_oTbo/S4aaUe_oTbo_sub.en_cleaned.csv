0.04,1.79,so this is a very exciting day not
1.8,3.75,because of this I mean you've seen this
3.76,6.19,before this is a basketball a Wilson
6.2,8.549,basketball it looks a lot like what they
8.559,12.27,use in the NBA but you may have seen
12.28,14.869,something some previews of something a
14.879,17.87,lot more high-tech it is Wilson's
17.88,20.63,futuristic basketball that's inside of
20.64,22.269,this box right here and I don't know
22.279,24.269,what the presentation is like I don't
24.279,25.87,know what the unboxing experience is
25.88,28.31,like all I know is that I was part of a
28.32,30.31,select group of people that were
30.32,32.19,contacted and asked if they would like
32.2,35.47,to receive this new high-tech basketball
35.48,38.67,and of course I said yes and now we are
38.68,40.63,here so the reason I've got this other
40.64,42.63,basketball is in order to compare the
42.64,46.229,two the futuristic 3D printed high- Tech
46.239,48.31,basketball that costs a lot of money
48.32,50.51,I'll tell you more about that later and
50.52,52.389,of course a standard basketball that you
52.399,54.389,can buy at any Sporting Goods store I
54.399,55.91,think this one was about 60 bucks
55.92,58.349,Canadian it's not the exact thing that
58.359,60.63,they use on the NBA court but it is what
60.64,62.99,we're used to bouncing and it bounces
63.0,65.39,essentially the same way so we'll test
65.4,66.83,them both out we'll see how the
66.84,70.429,traditional air bladder holds up against
70.439,74.39,the new technology without any air
74.4,76.27,inside of it at all well I mean there's
76.28,78.149,air inside of it but it's not enclosed
78.159,79.83,in there I don't know how they did it so
79.84,82.069,this episode has been sponsored by paper
82.079,83.95,like this is a screen protect for your
83.96,86.149,iPad now I've talked about dedicated
86.159,88.23,devices that can have this effect where
88.24,90.23,it feels like you're writing on paper
90.24,92.19,but the best thing about this product is
92.2,93.59,that it takes something you already have
93.6,95.109,like an iPad and something that's much
95.119,97.19,more versatile like an iPad and makes
97.2,100.03,its input far more satisfying and of
100.04,103.67,course artistic make your iPad feel like
103.68,105.149,Paper Plus at the same time it's
105.159,106.59,protecting your display but it doesn't
106.6,108.51,end there they've actually got these
108.52,111.149,little grips for apple pencil in order
111.159,113.63,to give you a much more comfortable hold
113.64,115.31,they've got two that come inside here
115.32,117.23,precision and comfort they've also just
117.24,119.35,come out with this spray this will keep
119.36,122.83,your screen squeaky clean oh the unit
122.84,125.83,itself is microfiber so
128.0,131.11,satisfying wow yeah so this Pro bundle
131.12,132.949,is styled as a one-pack solution for
132.959,134.71,iPad users it includes everything
134.72,136.03,someone needs to maximize their
136.04,138.11,productivity and creativity bundles
138.12,140.19,purchased online have been updated to
140.2,142.55,carry the most recent stock so this
142.56,144.589,screen protector has some proprietary
144.599,146.47,technology called Nano dots on the
146.48,148.35,surface this helps you achieve better
148.36,150.47,handwriting and excellent stroke
150.48,154.47,resistance while maintaining your screen
154.48,156.63,Clarity see one of the problems with
156.64,159.67,writing on your iPad is it doesn't have
159.68,162.47,a ton of feedback it feels like writing
162.48,165.91,on glass because well you are writing on
165.92,167.869,glass so once again thanks to paperlike
167.879,169.309,for sponsoring this portion of the
169.319,170.63,episode if you want to check out those
170.64,172.19,bundles head down to the description
172.2,173.71,I'll have all the links down there let's
173.72,176.19,take the classic out first now this
177.4,179.43,experience extremely straightforward
179.44,181.39,look at that
181.4,184.149,that's frustration
184.159,186.149,free this one could use a little bit
186.159,187.869,more air but we're going to dial it in
187.879,193.11,to the exact PSI suggestion from Wilson
193.12,198.39,There we go 8.1 that should
198.4,201.55,do yeah that that feels right that feels
201.56,203.229,good and by the way if you also like
203.239,204.91,that pump right there I can I'm going to
204.92,207.47,link that because that's satisfying
207.48,209.19,right you see the reading on there I use
209.2,212.35,it for the car Tires Plus it has a
212.36,214.589,rechargeable battery removable and so it
214.599,216.309,can share battery with your other tools
216.319,217.91,I don't know what you're into I'm into
217.92,220.39,that I'm into some things here we go it
221.799,224.91,time for us to finally get our hands on
224.92,227.75,something that was teased for a while I
227.76,229.63,don't even remember the first time that
229.64,231.99,this was shown off but I've wanted to
232.0,233.71,get my hands on it ever since I first
233.72,235.83,saw it like I saw the laboratory in
235.84,238.55,which they were developing it some of
238.56,240.99,those um initial prototypes I'm
241.0,243.47,surprised it's it's even a real product
243.48,244.83,like I didn't know if it was going to be
244.84,247.149,more of a concept car type thing that
247.159,249.55,then would eventually change and trickle
249.56,253.39,its way into the store for some like
253.4,256.31,budget price like a toy like I didn't
256.32,257.509,just didn't know what it was going to
257.519,259.55,end up being but it's kind of the
259.56,262.469,opposite they're like no this is
262.479,264.749,regulation basketball behavior and it's
264.759,267.83,going to cost you a lot of money wow and
267.84,271.71,it starts with the special case imagine
271.72,273.83,buying a basketball that comes in its
273.84,283.189,own suitcase
290.52,295.07,wow heirless gen one welcome to the
295.08,297.23,future of sports Wilson is dedicated to
297.24,298.43,pushing the boundaries of sports
298.44,300.909,Innovation with the aess gen one
300.919,303.51,basketball this moment marks a historic
303.52,305.909,achievement and we hope it fills you
305.919,307.749,with the significance it holds in the
307.759,309.629,world of basketball this is kind of like
309.639,312.87,a collector's item at this point like I
312.88,316.55,got look at this this base for
316.56,320.39,it mirror base Wilson heess gen one and
320.4,321.83,I got this
321.84,325.27,tag that's so cool unbox therapy custom
325.28,328.55,tag with the basketball pattern okay
328.56,331.07,let's get the ball out look at
331.08,334.909,this who like first of all it
334.919,338.11,feels way different it's hard to
338.12,341.909,describe this texture I mean I have
341.919,345.51,experience with 3D printing it kind of
345.52,348.27,feels like that substrate almost like
348.28,350.55,it's been sanded or smoothed out and
350.56,352.909,then the other thing I'm noticing right
352.919,357.87,away is the depth of the 3D printed
357.88,361.469,portion is it's not a single layer like
361.479,363.309,it's far more complicated than I
363.319,366.589,expected there's an interior and an
366.599,370.71,exterior wall and there's maybe a
370.72,373.71,centimeter of depth between them with
373.72,375.99,tiny little cutouts in between which I
376.0,379.07,presume are all completely necessary in
379.08,381.99,order to achieve the bounce that you're
382.0,383.43,looking for now there's a couple of
383.44,385.95,other important or like unique
385.96,388.189,characteristics you have heirless gen
388.199,390.07,one written over here
390.08,393.39,and you have the Wilson logo over here
393.4,395.35,but other than that it's a uniform
395.36,398.15,design and you can see the way they've
398.16,400.43,integrated your typical seams I mean
400.44,402.629,they're not really seams here I wonder
402.639,405.43,how long it would take to 3D print
405.44,408.71,something like this holding it I can
408.72,411.67,understand why it has the insane price
411.68,413.189,tag that it does and I'll just tell you
413.199,415.07,at this point this thing is
415.08,417.23,"$2,500 but there's not going to be many"
417.24,419.23,of them it's it's a limited edition type
419.24,421.189,of thing at least for now and it's
421.199,423.15,probably extremely timec consuming to
423.16,424.309,build this I don't know how many people
424.319,427.95,will actually use them versus keep them
427.96,430.15,as a collector's item like this for a
430.16,433.15,basketball fan that is something
433.16,435.39,incredibly exclusive the other thing I
435.4,438.309,notice is it's as you look around the
438.319,440.95,edge like you see here for example you
440.96,444.27,don't have entire cutouts Instead This
444.28,446.909,pinch comes through and it's not
446.919,450.23,completely symmetrical but I assume
450.24,455.469,that all this has been considered and
455.479,460.15,every indentation and and every puncture
460.16,464.83,is likely necessary plain original
464.84,468.35,basketball new airless gen one and I
468.36,470.67,think they wrote gen one on purpose in
470.68,473.189,order to imply hey we're not done here
473.199,476.39,we're releasing this for the super fans
476.4,478.99,this is going to be a developing space
479.0,482.469,at the moment the feel Advantage goes to
482.479,485.309,the traditional Wilson basketball the
486.28,488.469,advantage and the airless Advantage
488.479,490.749,obviously goes over here so let's go
490.759,493.71,ahead and
498.24,502.469,what okay first things first this the
502.479,504.55,sound this doesn't didn't come through
504.56,507.23,to me on the other videos that I watched
513.64,516.67,kind of satisfying though maybe you can
516.68,519.63,hear that it's like a a whoosh that goes
519.64,521.829,through the ball and I guess I should
521.839,523.35,have expected that because you've got
523.36,526.31,all these openings here it's bizarre
526.32,528.829,because it bounces the same way but yet
528.839,531.23,those other attributes like the the
531.24,533.99,sound difference and that air
534.0,537.15,friction kind of just changes your
537.16,539.269,perception of the bounce but it does
544.44,546.509,satisfying it made
546.519,549.43,me I mean the grip is a lot different
549.44,550.31,right I'm
550.32,554.59,feeling the texture on my
554.6,557.99,fingertips the grip is the biggest
560.44,562.91,traditional so
562.92,565.31,loud I remember thinking when I was
565.32,566.87,watching the All-Star game I was like I
566.88,567.91,wonder if they're going to use that
567.92,570.75,airless basketball but I'm realizing now
570.76,573.55,that it is much more unique than I
573.56,575.91,expected I was wondering if it would
575.92,578.55,feel anything like a regular basketball
578.56,581.51,it does
588.56,592.11,not they bounce almost exactly the same
592.12,594.35,way just your other senses are all
594.36,597.03,screwed up as to wait a second shouldn't
597.04,598.87,that have a louder sound in order to
598.88,600.269,bounce that
600.279,602.35,way but it
602.36,604.63,doesn't will you want to try I don't
604.64,606.63,know if it's intentional but there's
606.64,610.15,like a rough surface to yeah like a
610.16,614.389,proper 3D printed object
614.399,617.31,who it feels like
617.32,620.71,uh not a basketball it doesn't feel like
620.72,625.87,it but I know it behaves like it wo like
625.88,628.67,it bounces the way that it should it it
628.68,631.509,it's almost like the characteristics
631.519,634.15,don't match up in your mind because
634.16,635.949,you've bounced so many balls in your
635.959,638.99,life soccer volleyball basketball you
639.0,640.949,know what they feel like smells
640.959,645.389,different too well yeah I mean it smells
645.399,648.629,like smells like the future that's the
648.639,650.71,thing is the feedback is the same as a
650.72,652.11,basketball so you don't even you don't
652.12,654.23,need to look at it you don't need to
654.24,655.629,guess where it's going to bounce and the
655.639,657.71,crazy part is it has no PSI there's no
657.72,660.75,PSI and then the question becomes where
660.76,662.91,are the barriers and boundaries for this
662.92,665.47,what happens if you're outside versus
665.48,667.31,inside what if it's hot what if it's
667.32,670.269,cold the other what does the Sun do to
670.279,673.19,it like it's wet it's a lot of questions
673.2,675.31,would would it eventually get
675.32,678.79,discolored so obviously I can't test the
678.8,681.15,like PSI of something like this for
681.16,683.23,obvious reasons there's no air in it but
683.24,685.67,what I can test is the weight and see
685.68,687.79,how that compares to the other ball I've
687.8,689.99,got over there so uh first actually
690.0,693.11,let's get the weight of this ball and
693.12,696.43,remember this is inflated to just over 8
696.44,701.99,PSI that is just under 600 G NBA
702.0,707.79,basketball weight in G oh here we go an
709.2,714.389,basketball is 624 G now that's with the
714.399,717.79,ball being inflated between 7.5 and 8.5
717.8,721.79,pounds per inch
721.8,724.829,that probably has to do with the genuine
724.839,727.069,leather that the official ball uses this
727.079,729.069,one even though this is called the
729.079,730.949,authentic series it's an indoor outdoor
730.959,733.91,ball and this retails for about 60 bucks
733.92,737.79,so if the official uh weight of the ball
737.8,743.11,is 620 G then this is actually closer
743.12,747.509,than that ball at 6102 G anyway
747.519,749.949,extremely close regard L think about it
749.959,751.35,has to be the official size but then it
751.36,753.67,has to have synthetic leather regular
753.68,755.87,leather is going to be heavier so that's
755.88,757.75,how you have 600 here even though it's a
757.76,760.87,size seven and then an official NBA ball
760.88,765.189,is 620 and then I wonder if they
765.199,767.79,couldn't get 620 with this or you know
767.8,769.829,if whatever compromises had to be made
769.839,773.35,to make it bounce effectively with these
773.36,776.35,Dimensions maybe 610 and a half was as
776.36,778.11,close as they could get and I know some
778.12,780.31,people will watch the video and say well
780.32,781.59,I don't get it what's the point if it
781.6,783.269,ain't broke don't fix it like there's no
783.279,785.829,way that's as good as the existing
785.839,787.99,technology but that's not the idea if
788.0,790.31,there wasn't any experimentation you
790.32,792.829,wouldn't even necessarily land on where
792.839,795.11,they landed in the first place so
795.12,796.71,whether you're talking about sporting
796.72,799.069,equipment or electric vehicles or
799.079,800.829,smartphones or whatever the tech happens
800.839,803.67,to be it's experimentation and
803.68,807.75,generation one of something that
807.76,810.189,eventually takes you to where we end up
810.199,814.99,which is generation 2 3 4 5 10 will it
815.0,817.71,eventually be the standard basketball I
817.72,819.069,don't know I don't have that answer I
819.079,821.55,bet you even Wilson wouldn't say that
821.56,823.829,that's necessarily the case but maybe
823.839,825.99,some of their findings work their way
826.0,828.59,into a hybrid maybe there's an internal
828.6,830.949,bladder inside of a ball like this that
830.959,833.47,looks something like this and therefore
833.48,836.23,doesn't require inflation I don't know
836.24,838.91,what's going to happen but at the moment
838.92,842.189,this is certainly the most high-tech
842.199,844.189,basketball that I've seen and I'm
844.199,845.87,extremely grateful to be one of the
845.88,848.389,first people in the world to interact
848.399,854.749,with it that's pretty
