0,5,so this is a very exciting day not because of this I mean you 've seen this before this is a
5,10,basketball a Wilson basketball it looks a lot like what they use in the
10,15,NBA but you may have seen something some previews of something a
15,20,lot more high - tech it is Wilson 's futuristic basketball that 's
20,25,inside of this box right here and I do n't know what the presentation is like I do n't know what the
25,30,unboxing experience is like all I know is that I was part of a select group of people
30,35,that were contacted and asked if they would like to receive this new high - tech
35,40,basketball and of course I said yes and now we are here so the reason I 've
40,45,got this other basketball is in order to compare the two the futuristic 3D
45,50,printed high- Tech basketball that costs a lot of money I 'll tell you more about that
50,55,later and of course a standard basketball that you can buy at any Sporting Goods store I think this
55,60,one was about 60 bucks Canadian it 's not the exact thing that they use on the NBA court
60,65,but it is what we 're used to bouncing and it bounces essentially the same way so we
65,70,'ll test them both out we 'll see how the traditional air bladder holds up
70,75,against the new technology without any air inside of
75,80,it at all well I mean there 's air inside of it but it 's not enclosed in there I do n't know how they did it so
80,85,this episode has been sponsored by paper like this is a screen protect for your iPad now I 've
85,90,talked about dedicated devices that can have this effect where it feels like you 're writing on
90,95,paper but the best thing about this product is that it takes something you already have like an iPad and something that 's
95,100,much more versatile like an iPad and makes its input far more satisfying and
100,105,of course artistic make your iPad feel like Paper Plus at the same time
105,110,it 's protecting your display but it does n't end there they 've actually got these little grips for
110,115,apple pencil in order to give you a much more comfortable hold they 've got two that come
115,120,inside here precision and comfort they 've also just come out with this spray this will keep your
120,125,screen squeaky clean oh the unit itself is
125,130,microfiber so satisfying wow yeah so
130,135,this Pro bundle is styled as a one - pack solution for iPad users it includes everything
135,140,someone needs to maximize their productivity and creativity bundles purchased online have been
140,145,updated to carry the most recent stock so this screen protector has some proprietary
145,150,technology called Nano dots on the surface this helps you achieve better handwriting and
150,155,excellent stroke resistance while maintaining your screen Clarity
155,160,see one of the problems with writing on your iPad is it does n't have a
160,165,ton of feedback it feels like writing on glass because well you are
165,170,writing on glass so once again thanks to paperlike for sponsoring this portion of the episode if you want
170,175,to check out those bundles head down to the description I 'll have all the links down there let 's take the classic
175,180,out first now this experience extremely straightforward
180,185,look at that that 's frustration free this one
185,190,could use a little bit more air but we 're going to dial it in to the exact PSI
190,195,suggestion from Wilson There we
195,200,go 8.1 that should do yeah that that
200,205,feels right that feels good and by the way if you also like that pump right there I can I 'm going to
205,210,link that because that 's satisfying right you see the reading on there I use it for
210,215,the car Tires Plus it has a rechargeable battery removable and so it can
215,220,share battery with your other tools I do n't know what you 're into I 'm into that I 'm into some things here
220,225,we go it time for us to finally get our hands on
225,230,something that was teased for a while I do n't even remember the first time that this
230,235,was shown off but I 've wanted to get my hands on it ever since I first saw it like I saw the
235,240,laboratory in which they were developing it some of those um initial
240,245,prototypes I 'm surprised it 's it 's even a real product like I did n't know if it was going to be
245,250,more of a concept car type thing that then would eventually change and trickle its
250,255,way into the store for some like budget price like a
255,260,toy like I did n't just did n't know what it was going to end up being but it 's kind of the
260,265,opposite they 're like no this is regulation basketball behavior and it 's
265,270,going to cost you a lot of money wow and it starts with the
270,275,special case imagine buying a basketball that comes in its
275,280,own suitcase
290,295,wow heirless gen one welcome to
295,300,the future of sports Wilson is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of sports Innovation with the
300,305,aess gen one basketball this moment marks a historic achievement and we
305,310,hope it fills you with the significance it holds in the world of basketball this is kind of like a
310,315,collector 's item at this point like I got look at this
315,320,this base for it mirror base Wilson heess gen
320,325,one and I got this tag that 's so cool unbox therapy
325,330,custom tag with the basketball pattern okay let 's get the
330,335,ball out look at this who like first of all it
335,340,feels way different it 's hard to describe this
340,345,texture I mean I have experience with 3D printing it
345,350,kind of feels like that substrate almost like it 's been sanded or
350,355,smoothed out and then the other thing I 'm noticing right away is the
355,360,depth of the 3D printed portion is it 's not a
360,365,single layer like it 's far more complicated than I expected there 's
365,370,an interior and an exterior wall and there 's
370,375,maybe a centimeter of depth between them with tiny little cutouts
375,380,in between which I presume are all completely necessary in order to
380,385,achieve the bounce that you 're looking for now there 's a couple of other important or
385,390,like unique characteristics you have heirless gen one written over
390,395,here and you have the Wilson logo over here but other than that it 's a
395,400,uniform design and you can see the way they 've integrated your typical
400,405,seams I mean they 're not really seams here I wonder how long it would take to 3D
405,410,print something like this holding it I can understand why
410,415,it has the insane price tag that it does and I 'll just tell you at this point this thing
415,420,"is $ 2,500 but there 's not going to be many of them it 's it 's a limited edition type of thing at"
420,425,least for now and it 's probably extremely timec consuming to build this I do n't know how many people will
425,430,actually use them versus keep them as a collector 's item like this
430,435,for a basketball fan that is something incredibly exclusive the other
435,440,thing I notice is it 's as you look around the edge like you see here
440,445,for example you do n't have entire cutouts Instead This pinch
445,450,comes through and it 's not completely symmetrical but I
450,455,assume that all this has been considered
455,460,and every indentation and and every
460,465,puncture is likely necessary plain original
465,470,basketball new airless gen one and I think they wrote gen one on
470,475,purpose in order to imply hey we 're not done here we 're releasing this
475,480,for the super fans this is going to be a developing space at the
480,485,moment the feel Advantage goes to the traditional Wilson
485,490,basketball the advantage and the airless Advantage obviously goes over
490,495,here so let 's go ahead and
495,500,what okay
500,505,first things first this the sound this does n't did n't come through to me
505,510,on the other videos that I watched
510,515,kind of
515,520,satisfying though maybe you can hear that it 's like a a whoosh that goes
520,525,through the ball and I guess I should have expected that because you 've got all these openings
525,530,here it 's bizarre because it bounces the same way but yet those other
530,535,attributes like the the sound difference and that air friction
535,540,kind of just changes your perception of the bounce but it does
545,550,satisfying it made me I mean the grip is a lot different right
550,555,I 'm feeling the texture on my
555,560,fingertips the grip is the biggest
560,565,traditional so loud I remember thinking when
565,570,I was watching the All - Star game I was like I wonder if they 're going to use that airless basketball but I 'm
570,575,realizing now that it is much more unique than I expected I was
575,580,wondering if it would feel anything like a regular basketball it
580,585,does
585,590,not they bounce
590,595,almost exactly the same way just your other senses are all screwed
595,600,up as to wait a second should n't that have a louder sound in order to bounce
600,605,that way but it does n't will you want to try I do n't know
605,610,if it 's intentional but there 's like a rough surface to yeah
610,615,like a proper 3D printed object
615,620,who it feels like uh not a basketball it does n't
620,625,feel like it but I know it behaves like it
625,630,wo like it bounces the way that it should it it it 's almost like
630,635,the characteristics do n't match up in your mind because you 've bounced
635,640,so many balls in your life soccer volleyball basketball you know what they
640,645,feel like smells different too well yeah I mean it
645,650,smells like smells like the future that 's the thing is the feedback
650,655,is the same as a basketball so you do n't even you do n't need to look at it you do n't need to guess where it 's
655,660,going to bounce and the crazy part is it has no PSI there 's no PSI and then the question
660,665,becomes where are the barriers and boundaries for this what happens if you 're outside
665,670,versus inside what if it 's hot what if it 's cold the other what does the Sun
670,675,do to it like it 's wet it 's a lot of questions would would it
675,680,eventually get discolored so obviously I ca n't test the like PSI of
680,685,something like this for obvious reasons there 's no air in it but what I can test is the
685,690,weight and see how that compares to the other ball I 've got over there so uh first actually
690,695,let 's get the weight of this ball and let 's get the weight of this ball and remember this is
695,700,inflated to just over 8 PSI that is just
700,705,under 600 G NBA basketball weight
705,710,in G oh here we go an
710,715,basketball is 624 G now that 's with the ball
715,720,being inflated between 7.5 and 8.5 pounds
720,725,per inch that probably has to do with the genuine
725,730,leather that the official ball uses this one even though this is called the authentic series
730,735,it 's an indoor outdoor ball and this retails for about 60 bucks so if the
735,740,official uh weight of the ball is 620 G then
740,745,this is actually closer than that
745,750,ball at 6102 G anyway extremely close regard L think about it
750,755,has to be the official size but then it has to have synthetic leather regular leather is going to be
755,760,heavier so that 's how you have 600 here even though it 's a size seven and then an
760,765,official NBA ball is 620 and then I wonder if
765,770,they could n't get 620 with this or you know if whatever compromises had to be made
770,775,to make it bounce effectively with these Dimensions maybe
775,780,610 and a half was as close as they could get and I know some people will watch the video and
780,785,say well I do n't get it what 's the point if it ai n't broke do n't fix it like there 's no way that 's as good as
785,790,the existing technology but that 's not the idea if there was n't any
790,795,experimentation you would n't even necessarily land on where they landed in the first place
795,800,so whether you 're talking about sporting equipment or electric vehicles or smartphones or
800,805,whatever the tech happens to be it 's experimentation and
805,810,generation one of something that eventually takes you to where we
810,815,end up which is generation 2 3 4 5 10 will it
815,820,eventually be the standard basketball I eventually be the standard basketball I do n't know I do n't have that answer I bet you even
820,825,Wilson would n't say that that 's necessarily the case but maybe some of their
825,830,findings work their way into a hybrid maybe there 's an internal bladder inside of a
830,835,ball like this that looks something like this and therefore does n't require
835,840,inflation I do n't know what 's going to happen but at the moment this is
840,845,certainly the most high - tech basketball that I 've seen and I 'm extremely
845,850,grateful to be one of the first people in the world to interact with
850,855,it that 's pretty
