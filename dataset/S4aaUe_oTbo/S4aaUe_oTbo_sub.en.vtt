00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
thing is the feedback is the same as a

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.120 align:start position:0%

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.230 align:start position:0%

need<00:10:52.279><c> to</c><00:10:52.480><c> look</c><00:10:52.639><c> at</c><00:10:52.760><c> it</c><00:10:53.560><c> you</c><00:10:53.680><c> don't</c><00:10:53.839><c> need</c><00:10:54.000><c> to</c>

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
need to look at it you don't need to
 

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.629 align:start position:0%
need to look at it you don't need to

00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
guess where it's going to bounce and the
 

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:57.710 align:start position:0%
guess where it's going to bounce and the
crazy<00:10:55.959><c> part</c><00:10:56.120><c> is</c><00:10:56.279><c> it</c><00:10:56.440><c> has</c><00:10:56.600><c> no</c><00:10:56.839><c> PSI</c><00:10:57.320><c> there's</c><00:10:57.519><c> no</c>

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
crazy part is it has no PSI there's no
 

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.750 align:start position:0%
crazy part is it has no PSI there's no
PSI<00:10:58.560><c> and</c><00:10:58.680><c> then</c><00:10:58.800><c> the</c><00:10:59.120><c> question</c><00:10:59.639><c> becomes</c><00:11:00.639><c> where</c>

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
PSI and then the question becomes where
 

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.910 align:start position:0%
PSI and then the question becomes where
are<00:11:00.920><c> the</c><00:11:01.120><c> barriers</c><00:11:01.560><c> and</c><00:11:01.800><c> boundaries</c><00:11:02.320><c> for</c><00:11:02.600><c> this</c>

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%

what I can test is the weight and see

what I can test is the weight and see
