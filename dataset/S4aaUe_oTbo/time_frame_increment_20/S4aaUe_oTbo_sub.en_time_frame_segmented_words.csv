0,20,so this is a very exciting day not because of this I mean you 've seen this before this is a basketball a Wilson basketball it looks a lot like what they use in the NBA but you may have seen something some previews of something a lot more high - tech it is Wilson 's futuristic basketball that 's
20,40,inside of this box right here and I do n't know what the presentation is like I do n't know what the unboxing experience is like all I know is that I was part of a select group of people that were contacted and asked if they would like to receive this new high - tech basketball and of course I said yes and now we are here so the reason I 've
40,60,got this other basketball is in order to compare the two the futuristic 3D printed high- Tech basketball that costs a lot of money I 'll tell you more about that later and of course a standard basketball that you can buy at any Sporting Goods store I think this one was about 60 bucks Canadian it 's not the exact thing that they use on the NBA court
60,80,but it is what we 're used to bouncing and it bounces essentially the same way so we 'll test them both out we 'll see how the traditional air bladder holds up against the new technology without any air inside of it at all well I mean there 's air inside of it but it 's not enclosed in there I do n't know how they did it so
80,100,this episode has been sponsored by paper like this is a screen protect for your iPad now I 've talked about dedicated devices that can have this effect where it feels like you 're writing on paper but the best thing about this product is that it takes something you already have like an iPad and something that 's much more versatile like an iPad and makes its input far more satisfying and
100,120,of course artistic make your iPad feel like Paper Plus at the same time it 's protecting your display but it does n't end there they 've actually got these little grips for apple pencil in order to give you a much more comfortable hold they 've got two that come inside here precision and comfort they 've also just come out with this spray this will keep your
120,140,screen squeaky clean oh the unit itself is microfiber so satisfying wow yeah so this Pro bundle is styled as a one - pack solution for iPad users it includes everything someone needs to maximize their productivity and creativity bundles purchased online have been
140,160,updated to carry the most recent stock so this screen protector has some proprietary technology called Nano dots on the surface this helps you achieve better handwriting and excellent stroke resistance while maintaining your screen Clarity see one of the problems with writing on your iPad is it does n't have a
160,180,ton of feedback it feels like writing on glass because well you are writing on glass so once again thanks to paperlike for sponsoring this portion of the episode if you want to check out those bundles head down to the description I 'll have all the links down there let 's take the classic out first now this experience extremely straightforward
180,200,look at that that 's frustration free this one could use a little bit more air but we 're going to dial it in to the exact PSI suggestion from Wilson There we go 8.1 that should do yeah that that
200,220,feels right that feels good and by the way if you also like that pump right there I can I 'm going to link that because that 's satisfying right you see the reading on there I use it for the car Tires Plus it has a rechargeable battery removable and so it can share battery with your other tools I do n't know what you 're into I 'm into that I 'm into some things here
220,240,we go it time for us to finally get our hands on something that was teased for a while I do n't even remember the first time that this was shown off but I 've wanted to get my hands on it ever since I first saw it like I saw the laboratory in which they were developing it some of those um initial
240,260,prototypes I 'm surprised it 's it 's even a real product like I did n't know if it was going to be more of a concept car type thing that then would eventually change and trickle its way into the store for some like budget price like a toy like I did n't just did n't know what it was going to end up being but it 's kind of the
260,280,opposite they 're like no this is regulation basketball behavior and it 's going to cost you a lot of money wow and it starts with the special case imagine buying a basketball that comes in its own
280,300,suitcase wow heirless gen one welcome to the future of sports Wilson is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of sports Innovation with the
300,320,aess gen one basketball this moment marks a historic achievement and we hope it fills you with the significance it holds in the world of basketball this is kind of like a collector 's item at this point like I got look at this this base for it mirror base Wilson heess gen
320,340,one and I got this tag that 's so cool unbox therapy custom tag with the basketball pattern okay let 's get the ball out look at this who like first of all it feels way different it 's hard to describe this
340,360,texture I mean I have experience with 3D printing it kind of feels like that substrate almost like it 's been sanded or smoothed out and then the other thing I 'm noticing right away is the depth of the 3D printed portion is it 's not a
360,380,single layer like it 's far more complicated than I expected there 's an interior and an exterior wall and there 's maybe a centimeter of depth between them with tiny little cutouts in between which I presume are all completely necessary in order to
380,400,achieve the bounce that you 're looking for now there 's a couple of other important or like unique characteristics you have heirless gen one written over here and you have the Wilson logo over here but other than that it 's a uniform design and you can see the way they 've integrated your typical
400,420,"seams I mean they 're not really seams here I wonder how long it would take to 3D print something like this holding it I can understand why it has the insane price tag that it does and I 'll just tell you at this point this thing is $ 2,500 but there 's not going to be many of them it 's it 's a limited edition type of thing at"
420,440,least for now and it 's probably extremely timec consuming to build this I do n't know how many people will actually use them versus keep them as a collector 's item like this for a basketball fan that is something incredibly exclusive the other thing I notice is it 's as you look around the edge like you see here
440,460,for example you do n't have entire cutouts Instead This pinch comes through and it 's not completely symmetrical but I assume that all this has been considered and every indentation and and every
460,480,puncture is likely necessary plain original basketball new airless gen one and I think they wrote gen one on purpose in order to imply hey we 're not done here we 're releasing this for the super fans this is going to be a developing space at the
480,500,moment the feel Advantage goes to the traditional Wilson basketball the advantage and the airless Advantage obviously goes over here so let 's go ahead and what okay
500,520,first things first this the sound this does n't did n't come through to me on the other videos that I watched kind of satisfying though maybe you can hear that it 's like a a whoosh that goes
520,540,through the ball and I guess I should have expected that because you 've got all these openings here it 's bizarre because it bounces the same way but yet those other attributes like the the sound difference and that air friction kind of just changes your perception of the bounce but it does
540,560,satisfying it made me I mean the grip is a lot different right I 'm feeling the texture on my fingertips the grip is the biggest
560,580,traditional so loud I remember thinking when I was watching the All - Star game I was like I wonder if they 're going to use that airless basketball but I 'm realizing now that it is much more unique than I expected I was wondering if it would feel anything like a regular basketball it
580,600,does not they bounce almost exactly the same way just your other senses are all screwed up as to wait a second should n't that have a louder sound in order to bounce
600,620,that way but it does n't will you want to try I do n't know if it 's intentional but there 's like a rough surface to yeah like a proper 3D printed object who it feels like uh not a basketball it does n't
620,640,feel like it but I know it behaves like it wo like it bounces the way that it should it it it 's almost like the characteristics do n't match up in your mind because you 've bounced so many balls in your life soccer volleyball basketball you know what they
640,660,feel like smells different too well yeah I mean it smells like smells like the future that 's the thing is the feedback is the same as a basketball so you do n't even you do n't need to look at it you do n't need to guess where it 's going to bounce and the crazy part is it has no PSI there 's no PSI and then the question
660,680,becomes where are the barriers and boundaries for this what happens if you 're outside versus inside what if it 's hot what if it 's cold the other what does the Sun do to it like it 's wet it 's a lot of questions would would it eventually get discolored so obviously I ca n't test the like PSI of
680,700,something like this for obvious reasons there 's no air in it but what I can test is the weight and see how that compares to the other ball I 've got over there so uh first actually let 's get the weight of this ball and remember this is inflated to just over 8 PSI that is just
700,720,under 600 G NBA basketball weight in G oh here we go an basketball is 624 G now that 's with the ball being inflated between 7.5 and 8.5 pounds
720,740,per inch that probably has to do with the genuine leather that the official ball uses this one even though this is called the authentic series it 's an indoor outdoor ball and this retails for about 60 bucks so if the official uh weight of the ball is 620 G then
740,760,this is actually closer than that ball at 6102 G anyway extremely close regard L think about it has to be the official size but then it has to have synthetic leather regular leather is going to be heavier so that 's how you have 600 here even though it 's a size seven and then an
760,780,official NBA ball is 620 and then I wonder if they could n't get 620 with this or you know if whatever compromises had to be made to make it bounce effectively with these Dimensions maybe 610 and a half was as close as they could get and I know some people will watch the video and
780,800,say well I do n't get it what 's the point if it ai n't broke do n't fix it like there 's no way that 's as good as the existing technology but that 's not the idea if there was n't any experimentation you would n't even necessarily land on where they landed in the first place so whether you 're talking about sporting equipment or electric vehicles or smartphones or
800,820,whatever the tech happens to be it 's experimentation and generation one of something that eventually takes you to where we end up which is generation 2 3 4 5 10 will it eventually be the standard basketball I do n't know I do n't have that answer I bet you even
820,840,Wilson would n't say that that 's necessarily the case but maybe some of their findings work their way into a hybrid maybe there 's an internal bladder inside of a ball like this that looks something like this and therefore does n't require inflation I do n't know what 's going to happen but at the moment this is
840,860,certainly the most high - tech basketball that I 've seen and I 'm extremely grateful to be one of the first people in the world to interact with it that 's pretty
