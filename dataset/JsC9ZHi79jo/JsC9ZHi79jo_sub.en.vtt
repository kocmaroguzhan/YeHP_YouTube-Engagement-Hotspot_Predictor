00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.430
So, I have a little test for you.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.100
Don't panic.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.111
I'm not here to judge you.

00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:23.182
It's just a little test, OK?

00:00:23.412 --> 00:00:28.571
First, you get 30 seconds
to memorize 10 words in the right order.

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:34.226
After that, you get 30 seconds
to write down what you remembered.

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:38.137
And then finally, you get 30 seconds
to check your answers.

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:40.106
So, are you guys ready?

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:42.578
Well, we're going to start anyway.

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:44.982
So,

00:00:45.487 --> 00:00:49.207
memorize 10 words
in the right order in 30 seconds

00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:52.947
in three, two, one, go!

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.377
OK. Stop.

00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:26.715
Now write down what you remember.

00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:00.120
OK, and stop.

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:03.532
Now quickly check your answers.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.019
OK, and stop.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.104
Very exciting; I heard
a lot of grunting and moaning.

00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:37.483
So I hope I didn't stress
you out too much.

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:41.825
Now a moment of reflection.

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:44.565
I'd like you to ask yourself,

00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:50.975
"How did I memorize this,
and was it the best way to do it?"

00:02:56.185 --> 00:03:00.115
Now, for the generation
of my parents and grandparents,

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:04.667
being able to memorize something like this
was an absolutely essential skill.

00:03:04.677 --> 00:03:08.621
But nowadays, why would anyone
want to remember a list of anything?

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.602
You just take a picture of the screen,
and you're done, right?

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:19.143
it seemed as if memorizing
has somehow become less important.

00:03:19.773 --> 00:03:22.363
So why should we then,
in today's day and age,

00:03:22.363 --> 00:03:24.473
still want to get better at memorizing?

00:03:25.274 --> 00:03:28.664
Well, to answer that question,
I'd like to tell you a little story.

00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:34.367
In high school, I flunked a grade, twice.

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:38.928
After seven years of torture,
I finally got my diploma.

00:03:39.337 --> 00:03:41.268
Sweet, sweet freedom!

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.473
What would I do with it?

00:03:43.853 --> 00:03:44.954
I didn't know.

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:46.794
One thing I did know, however,

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:49.203
was that I didn't want
to go back to school

00:03:49.553 --> 00:03:51.774
because that old learning business,

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:53.854
it wasn't cut out for me.

00:03:54.523 --> 00:03:59.464
So instead, I went
to sunny California for nine months,

00:03:59.464 --> 00:04:02.965
and there I worked as a bagger,
not beggar - bagger.

00:04:03.385 --> 00:04:04.675
So in a supermarket,

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:08.496
I had to put people's groceries in bags,
and then I'd get a little tip.

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:14.095
Surprisingly, that year I learned so much.

00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:17.461
I learned how to bag a bunch
of groceries really, really quickly.

00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:20.521
I learned how to drive a car.

00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:21.701
And in California,

00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:24.892
people are a little bit more open
than they are in Amsterdam.

00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:28.161
So I also learned how to have
a little chat with a stranger,

00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:29.512
just for the hell of it.

00:04:30.122 --> 00:04:33.093
That year I discovered
that I don't hate learning,

00:04:33.693 --> 00:04:35.953
just the specific way of doing it.

00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:39.433
So I decided to go and study psychology.

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:41.262
Now for the first time ever,

00:04:41.262 --> 00:04:44.469
I was getting information
that I absolutely wanted to know.

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.258
Now I was spending
more time in the library

00:04:47.258 --> 00:04:51.558
than I spent skipping school
as a teenager, voluntarily.

00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:57.310
The only problem was that I was
spending all of my time in the library

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.430
because I'd never learned how to learn.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.179
So I started experimenting
with different methods of reading texts,

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.580
of memorizing texts,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.599
and I got my reading time
of three hours per chapter down to one.

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:15.362
This way of studying
enabled me to do an honors program,

00:05:15.362 --> 00:05:16.975
to get my degree,

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:19.005
and to fall in love with learning.

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:23.656
And now I happily work
for a company called Remind,

00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:27.516
in which we teach people
the science and art of learning.

00:05:28.217 --> 00:05:32.067
We're trying to bring back into education
what we ourselves missed.

00:05:32.737 --> 00:05:34.116
Now for the past three years,

00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:37.376
we've also organized
the Dutch National Memory Championships

00:05:37.376 --> 00:05:38.958
for high schoolers.

00:05:39.407 --> 00:05:43.701
We do this to show that everybody
is capable of amazing feats of memory,

00:05:44.192 --> 00:05:46.972
but also to show that memorization

00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:52.102
is about a lot more than just learning
your French or your Spanish words.

00:05:52.122 --> 00:05:54.603
And today I'd also like
to share this with you.

00:05:55.202 --> 00:05:57.442
So, in the beginning,

00:05:57.563 --> 00:05:59.503
I made you do this little test,

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:03.782
just to make you aware
of how you're memorizing things right now.

00:06:04.593 --> 00:06:07.704
Next, I'd like to give you
a new type of memory experience.

00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:11.093
This time you can even sit back and relax.

00:06:11.714 --> 00:06:15.103
So I'm going to ask you
to find a comfortable position to sit,

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:20.991
to close your eyes,
and to take a deep breath.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.991
Now, I want you to think
of someone you know called John,

00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:33.501
and I want you to see him.

00:06:34.672 --> 00:06:39.132
Now, John just grabbed the sun
out of the sky,

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.112
and he just threw it on your feet.

00:06:41.482 --> 00:06:45.037
And now your feet are getting
really big and red and swollen

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:49.056
because John just
threw the sun on your feet.

00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:53.256
Now you look to your knees,

00:06:54.086 --> 00:06:58.488
and on your knees, you see
10 little guys playing basketball -

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:00.247
very strange sight.

00:07:00.247 --> 00:07:02.047
And on their shirts,

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:06.728
you can see in brightly
colored letters the "New York Knicks,"

00:07:07.858 --> 00:07:10.288
so you have some Knicks on your knees.

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:16.817
Next, you look to where your thighs are,

00:07:17.014 --> 00:07:18.534
but they're gone.

00:07:19.054 --> 00:07:22.124
Your thighs have been replaced
with Fords, the cars.

00:07:23.024 --> 00:07:25.744
They could be Ford Focuses
or Ford Mustangs.

00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:29.164
Your thighs have been replaced with Fords.

00:07:30.126 --> 00:07:32.065
Now, with your bottom,

00:07:32.065 --> 00:07:37.246
you feel a hard plastic seat
of a go-kart vibrating.

00:07:38.565 --> 00:07:42.386
With your bottom, you feel
the hard plastic seat of a go-kart.

00:07:43.621 --> 00:07:47.132
Your belly starts rumbling very loudly.

00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:51.071
So you follow your belly,
and it leads you to McDonald's,

00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:57.371
and there Ronald McDonald
starts shooting rays of light at you

00:07:57.371 --> 00:07:58.952
with a ray gun.

00:08:00.082 --> 00:08:03.732
Ronald McDonald is shooting rays of light
at you with a ray gun.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.161
He hits you on your chest,

00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:13.573
and now from your chest,
a big bush of gray hairs is growing.

00:08:14.722 --> 00:08:17.598
A huge bush of gray hair
is growing from your chest.

00:08:18.049 --> 00:08:20.909
So obviously, you hurry home
to shave it off,

00:08:21.453 --> 00:08:24.689
and on your doormat, you see a letter.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.580
So you open it and it has good news.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.109
As you read it, you feel a huge weight
falling off your shoulders.

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:36.820
A huge weight falling off your shoulders.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.751
Your shoulders get all light and tingly
because you just paid all of your bills.

00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:42.751
Big bills, little bills,

00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:46.985
each and every bill has been paid for,
and you have plenty of money to spare.

00:08:50.485 --> 00:08:53.137
Now you proceed to the bathroom,

00:08:53.137 --> 00:08:55.256
because now on your neck,

00:08:55.256 --> 00:08:59.533
a bunch of tiny bushes
of thin blonde hairs have appeared.

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:03.895
On your neck, a bunch of tiny bushes
of thin blonde hair.

00:09:05.566 --> 00:09:07.427
As you look in the mirror,

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:10.997
suddenly your mouth
just starts talking all by itself,

00:09:11.957 --> 00:09:17.573
and it's saying, "Yes, we can;
yes we can; yes we can."

00:09:19.533 --> 00:09:23.444
Now you turn around,
and now suddenly your eyes are, ah,

00:09:23.732 --> 00:09:27.424
because Donald Duck
just poked out both of your eyes

00:09:27.424 --> 00:09:29.893
with a trumpet made of pure gold.

00:09:32.524 --> 00:09:36.995
Now you can open your eyes again
and come back to this place.

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:40.075
Luckily, it's a lot safer here
than where you just came from.

00:09:41.724 --> 00:09:46.149
So, I just made you guys memorize

00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:49.254
the past 10 presidents
of the United States of America

00:09:49.254 --> 00:09:50.910
in the right order.

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:53.421
Now I'm going to show you,

00:09:53.421 --> 00:09:55.980
and then you can see
how many of these you still know.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.029
So with each body part, I'm going
to ask you what happened there,

00:09:59.029 --> 00:10:00.510
and then you could think of it.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.200
Even better would be
if you just shout it out.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.201
Now, what happened to your feet?

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:10.775
John threw the sun, yeah -
President Johnson.

00:10:10.775 --> 00:10:11.985
(Laughter)

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:18.867
Now, what happened on your knees?
Knicks, yes - President Nixon.

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:22.637
OK. So what were your thighs
replaced with?

00:10:23.228 --> 00:10:25.058
Fords - President Ford.

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:28.269
OK, and what did you feel
with your bottom?

00:10:29.418 --> 00:10:32.049
OK, President Carter, yes.

00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:34.178
Some people are ahead of the game.

00:10:35.708 --> 00:10:38.938
Now, your belly led you to McDonald's;

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:40.478
what happened?

00:10:41.479 --> 00:10:44.071
OK. Ronald McDonald shooting rays of …

00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:46.663
So Ronald Reagan.

00:10:46.993 --> 00:10:49.173
He hits in your chest, and you got what?

00:10:50.054 --> 00:10:52.824
Big bush of gray hairs - Bush senior.

00:10:52.824 --> 00:10:55.304
(Laughter)

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.024
Now, your shoulders got light, why?

00:11:01.914 --> 00:11:04.184
Paid all your bills - Bill Clinton.

00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:08.265
Now, what did you have on your neck?

00:11:09.975 --> 00:11:12.796
OK, a bush of thin blonde hairs.

00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:14.566
Bush junior.

00:11:15.206 --> 00:11:17.212
What was your mouth saying?

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.331
"Yes we can" - President Obama.

00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:22.791
And what happened to your eyes?

00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:27.947
Yeah, Donald Duck, trumpet, pure gold.

00:11:27.947 --> 00:11:30.023
Who else but Donald Trump?

00:11:30.713 --> 00:11:36.463
So, if you memorized more this time
than the first time, please stand up.

00:11:43.117 --> 00:11:45.159
OK. So we have almost
everyone standing up;

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:46.457
that's awesome.

00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:51.859
Now, if you think this way of memorizing
is more fun than the last way you used,

00:11:51.859 --> 00:11:55.289
please stand up or remain standing
if you're already standing.

00:11:57.489 --> 00:11:59.539
Oh whoa, now we almost have everyone.

00:11:59.539 --> 00:12:01.150
I'm very pleased to see this.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.789
OK. You guys can sit back down.

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:04.078
Thank you very much.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.870
Now, when you make
bizarre images to memorize,

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.810
suddenly it becomes a lot easier.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.235
If you tie these bizarre images
to a place you know well,

00:12:18.235 --> 00:12:19.597
like your body,

00:12:19.597 --> 00:12:22.886
suddenly memorizing things in order
becomes a lot easier.

00:12:23.007 --> 00:12:24.256
OK. Well, cool.

00:12:24.256 --> 00:12:26.847
But I asked you guys in the beginning,

00:12:27.707 --> 00:12:30.037
"Why should we, in today's day and age,

00:12:30.037 --> 00:12:32.887
still want to get better
at this - at memorizing?"

00:12:33.367 --> 00:12:37.537
Well, because by getting better
in a skill like this,

00:12:38.077 --> 00:12:40.838
you can also get better
at a different skill:

00:12:40.838 --> 00:12:42.932
the skill of experimentation.

00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:46.872
By experimenting with different
methods of doing things,

00:12:47.172 --> 00:12:49.604
I found out that I can
get better at anything.

00:12:50.064 --> 00:12:52.592
I found out what works
for me and what doesn't.

00:12:52.982 --> 00:12:55.683
What if I'd never learned
the skill of experimentation?

00:12:56.063 --> 00:12:58.233
I may have never gone back to school;

00:12:58.233 --> 00:13:01.274
I may have never enjoyed
studying psychology,

00:13:01.274 --> 00:13:04.024
and I probably would not
have been standing here today,

00:13:04.324 --> 00:13:09.014
because one of the things I thought
I really couldn't do was public speaking.

00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:15.074
Now, there are people of every generation
not doing things that they might love,

00:13:15.074 --> 00:13:17.231
that they might even be great at

00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:19.551
because they think they can't do it.

00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:21.871
So how beautiful would it be

00:13:21.871 --> 00:13:26.221
if in schools we can teach kids
that they can get better at anything,

00:13:26.221 --> 00:13:29.670
and they can even get better
at getting better at things, get it?

00:13:30.981 --> 00:13:32.232
But not just the kids,

00:13:32.232 --> 00:13:35.541
because the older generation
is often seen as too old to learn.

00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:37.452
But they're not too rusty.

00:13:37.452 --> 00:13:40.281
Anyone can improve themselves
by experimenting,

00:13:40.281 --> 00:13:42.551
and I hope you experienced that today.

00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:44.676
Now at Remind,

00:13:44.676 --> 00:13:48.256
we break up this process
of experimentation into three steps:

00:13:48.676 --> 00:13:52.456
the check, the experience
and the experiment.

00:13:53.522 --> 00:13:57.027
The check is all about becoming aware
of what you're doing right now.

00:13:57.827 --> 00:14:01.227
So maybe during the first test,
you became aware of the fact

00:14:01.227 --> 00:14:03.353
that you just repeat
the words over and over

00:14:03.353 --> 00:14:05.479
and that that doesn't work too well.

00:14:06.198 --> 00:14:07.368
The second step:

00:14:07.368 --> 00:14:12.288
the experience is all about being open
to new possibilities and trying them out.

00:14:12.969 --> 00:14:14.888
So maybe during the visualization,

00:14:14.888 --> 00:14:18.214
you realize that this works a bit better
or at least you like it more.

00:14:19.555 --> 00:14:22.095
And the third step is the experiment.

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:26.115
This is about taking something
from that new experience that you had

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:29.567
and applying it in your own life
to see how it works for you.

00:14:29.957 --> 00:14:32.185
So, maybe you're one of those people

00:14:32.185 --> 00:14:34.416
that when someone
introduces themselves to you,

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.517
you just immediately forget their name.

00:14:36.517 --> 00:14:37.986
Yeah, sound familiar?

00:14:37.986 --> 00:14:41.968
And you want to use visualization
to do something about that.

00:14:42.318 --> 00:14:46.201
So far I've only taken you guys
through the first two steps.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.492
The final step is up to you.

00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:52.181
So when I'm done here,
I'd like you to take a moment for yourself

00:14:52.181 --> 00:14:55.542
and to write down an experiment
on the little card we've given you

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:58.123
and to put that
in your wallet as a reminder.

00:14:58.853 --> 00:15:03.052
By continually following
these steps of experimentation,

00:15:03.052 --> 00:15:04.822
you discover what you're doing;

00:15:04.822 --> 00:15:07.142
you keep yourself open
to new possibilities,

00:15:07.142 --> 00:15:10.504
and you allow yourself
to continually transform.

00:15:10.504 --> 00:15:12.364
And regardless of what you're learning,

00:15:12.364 --> 00:15:15.043
be it memorizing
or martial arts or mathematics,

00:15:15.543 --> 00:15:18.939
you'll get better not only in the skill
that you're trying to develop,

00:15:18.939 --> 00:15:21.710
but you'll get better
at the process of learning itself.

00:15:22.769 --> 00:15:24.730
And that's something that sticks.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.090
It's something you could take with you
to your new job, your new hobby,

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.109
your new relationship, your new whatever.

00:15:30.579 --> 00:15:33.659
So this is something
absolutely everyone should know,

00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:36.569
and I believe we should
teach it in schools.

00:15:36.569 --> 00:15:40.641
But let's not just wait for it
to be implemented in schools.

00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:44.725
I also believe that the most important
change starts with the individual.

00:15:45.054 --> 00:15:46.474
It starts with you.

00:15:47.065 --> 00:15:49.065
So, go out there and experiment.

00:15:49.065 --> 00:15:50.258
Learn something new

00:15:50.258 --> 00:15:52.875
or a new way of approaching something old

00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:57.216
because there are few skills
as valuable as the art of learning.

00:15:57.766 --> 00:15:59.046
Thank you.

00:15:59.046 --> 00:16:01.767
(Applause)
