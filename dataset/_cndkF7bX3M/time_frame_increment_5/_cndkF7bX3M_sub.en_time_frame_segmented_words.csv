0,5,I 'm in the middle of the
5,10,countryside in Uruguay trying to find this . A
10,15,forest shaped like a fingerprint . We 're here because of a screenshot of Google
15,20,"Earth that somebody posted to Reddit . In 2022 , a Reddit user"
20,25,named tarek619 found “ strange DNA - like forests spanning some 30
25,30,kilometers in Uruguay . ” I looked at the forest . I was n't totally sure
30,35,"what was “ DNA - like ” about it , but it was strange . And then I zoomed out . And"
35,40,"saw that it was just part of a whole array of forests , all in mesmerizing"
40,45,designs . Then I zoomed out more . Forests like this covered the
45,50,entire country . But I could n't stop looking at this one . It looked like a
50,55,"fingerprint . From Street View , I could just barely make out what it was : Long"
55,60,rows of identical trees . If I wanted to see inside one of these
60,65,"forests , I would have to go see it for myself . So I went . And"
65,70,discovered something much more complex than I expected . But it all started
70,75,with one question : Why did this forest look like a
75,80,fingerprint ?
80,85,"Before I left , I started with some highly advanced research methods ."
85,90,"And I started reading . According to a Uruguayan government report , about 1 million of"
90,95,Uruguay 's 17 million hectares of land are covered with pine and eucalyptus
95,100,plantations . Tree farms . Artificial forests . That 's why they
100,105,"were planted in these rows of identical trees . Reading more , I learned that the"
105,110,"majority of those trees are turned into pulp . Not pulp like orange juice , pulp like wood pulp :"
110,115,"Soft , wet , chemically - separated cellulose that becomes the main ingredient in"
115,120,"making paper products : Printing paper , paper towels , toilet paper ,"
120,125,"napkins , anything . And according to the very first result on Google search ,"
125,130,"these forests were a “ miracle . ” On a continent devastated by deforestation ,"
130,135,Uruguay was one of the few countries where forest cover had actually
135,140,expanded . It sounded like a massive accomplishment . These strikingly arranged forests
140,145,appeared to be part of some nationwide project . If it really was a
145,150,"miracle , I had to see it ."
155,160,"After three flights , to Miami"
160,165,"and then to Lima , I have finally made it to Montevideo . I am sitting"
165,170,"in traffic right now , waiting to pick up Faustina Bartaburu . Hey , how 's it"
170,175,going ? She 's a journalist based here in Montevideo . I 'll be there in like 5 minutes . Between finding
175,180,"the forests on Google Earth and coming here , I 'd connected with her to help us"
180,185,find experts in Uruguay . Experts who could help us learn more about
185,190,the forests . Starting with a representative from the forestry industry .
195,200,"That 's “ afforestation . ” Not reforestation , where"
200,205,"trees are restored to a depleted forest , but where trees are planted in a place"
205,210,where no trees existed before .
215,220,"Just 40 years ago , these forests were"
220,225,"n't here at all . In 1987 , the Uruguayan government passed a law that protected the"
225,230,"country 's native forests , but also declared a “ national interest ” in developing new “"
230,235,"forestry resources , ” “ forestry industries , ” and a “ forestry economy . ” The law"
235,240,"set the stage for a boom for the forestry industry . All over the country ,"
240,245,the transformation was dramatic .
245,250,"Today , Uruguay has"
250,255,"more plantation forest cover than native forest cover , and the country 's wood"
255,260,pulp industry employs thousands of people . Wood pulp has become Uruguay 's second -
260,265,"biggest export , totaling over $ 2 billion in 2023 , and it 's on the"
265,270,verge of becoming the biggest . Uruguay created an industry that has radically
270,275,"reshaped the country 's landscape , but also its economy ."
295,300,We had a basic understanding of why the forests were there .
300,305,"So we met up with a videographer and drone operator who would help us document the journey ,"
305,310,and we set off to find the fingerprint .
310,315,"We 're just about an hour north of Montevideo right now , and you can already start"
315,320,to see all of these plantations dotting the horizon .
320,325,We are on our way to try to find that fingerprint .
325,330,"Yeah , I mean , at this point , we do n't know what it 's going to look like , if it 's"
330,335,"going to look anything like the satellite image . I mean , these trees could have been cut . They could have grown in a"
335,340,way that the pattern is kind of hard to recognize now ... Anything could have
340,345,changed . I really want to see the shapes from above .
345,350,Yeah . I 've never been this excited to see some trees in my life .
350,355,"We must be getting close , right ? Yeah ."
360,365,We are here . Cool . We
365,370,made it .
370,375,"I mean , I know it 's not natural , but it seems"
375,380,somehow natural . It 's great . You want to see it ? I do . I do .
380,385,Wow .
385,390,Crazy . It 's like the perfect match .
390,395,There it was . A perfect
395,400,"fingerprint shape , exactly like we 'd seen on the"
400,405,Internet . Made up of thousands of trees .
410,415,And surrounded by forest after forest in the same
415,420,kind of design . But
420,425,there was a problem . We wanted to go inside . And every forest we ’d
425,430,"passed was completely inaccessible . There 's a lot of fences , so think it"
430,435,'ll be hard to get inside . It was frustrating . We did n't want to trespass . And after
435,440,"traveling all this way , it was n't clear if we 'd be able to see much more"
440,445,"than this . But then down the road , we saw a sign on one of those fences ."
445,450,INIA . The country 's National Institute for Agricultural Research . We
450,455,sent them an email asking if they could get us inside . But as we drove
455,460,"around the area , something else caught our eye . Wood trucks . They"
460,465,were everywhere .
465,470,There 's another one . There 's
470,475,another one . There 's another one .
475,480,"Hundreds of trucks full of logs going one direction , empty trucks"
480,485,"going the other direction . As the sun set , we"
485,490,decided to follow them . We 're
490,495,going to try to follow the trucks that are full of trees to see where
495,500,they 're going .
500,505,After driving in the dark for
505,510,"an hour and a half , we saw where they were going ."
510,515,We ’d arrived in Paso de los
515,520,Toros . It 's the home of one of the
520,525,"biggest wood pulp mills in the world , owned by a company called UPM . They"
525,530,had written that first article I saw about Uruguay 's “ forestry miracle . ”
530,535,The construction of this mill was major national news .
545,550,UPM ’s facility here is massive . Its size rivals that of the
550,555,"city of Paso de los Toros itself , a small town of 13,000 people ."
575,580,Fernando also
580,585,told us about a really specific change that had occurred in the town .
600,605,Little Helsinki . It 's a neighborhood in Paso de los Toros where
605,610,high - level UPM employees live . We drove over to see it . Just a few blocks from a town
610,615,"that mostly looked like this , were these long rows of identical homes ,"
615,620,straight out of an architectural design magazine .
620,625,"It 's physical evidence of the ties this community has to somewhere else ,"
625,630,"somewhere very far away . Because UPM is n't from Uruguay , or from"
630,635,"South America , but from Finland . UPM , a Finnish company , is one of"
635,640,"the largest landowners in Uruguay , owning almost 30 % of Uruguay"
640,645,'s 1.1 million hectares of forest plantations . The construction of
645,650,"this pulp mill was the single largest investment in the history of UPM , and the single"
650,655,largest foreign investment in the history of Uruguay : Over $ 3 billion .
660,665,"Standing outside the mill , we could see full trucks driving in , empty"
665,670,trucks driving out . But we later learned that that 's not all that 's happening
670,675,here . Because these trucks are driving out of land subject to Uruguay 's normal
675,680,"tax laws , and into a “ tax - free zone ” that the Uruguayan government set up just for this"
680,685,"pulp mill . It 's not just company property , it 's an economic space the government"
685,690,created to stimulate forestry production . UPM is just one of several
690,695,"companies involved in forestry production here , but it runs two of the country 's three"
695,700,"mills for processing eucalyptus into pulp . Together , these mills"
700,705,turn 17 million tons of wood into 4.8 million tons of pulp every
705,710,"year , each within their own “ free trade zone . ” We"
710,715,"reached out to UPM , hoping to talk to someone from the company while we were in Paso de los Toros . But"
715,720,"after a short back and forth , they stopped responding to our emails ."
720,725,"Then , INIA got back to us . They were able to get us inside a forest . Not"
725,730,"the fingerprint forest , but a similar plantation they use for research purposes ."
730,735,We hoped the visit could help us learn more about why they look that way .
735,740,"We met the guide from INIA , Federico , and suited up :"
740,745,"vests for visibility , shin guards to protect against snakes , and helmets in"
745,750,"case of falling debris . I have a really big head , so this might be"
750,755,hard . Then we headed inside .
770,775,It 's colder here . Yeah . You
775,780,"definitely notice the temperature change . Finally , we"
780,785,"were inside one of these forests . We 'd seen them from above , and now we"
785,790,"were seeing one up close . Seeing , touching , smelling the habitat"
790,795,we ’d traveled all this way to experience .
810,815,These eucalyptus trees are not native to Uruguay . They 're from
815,820,"Australia . But they grow really , really , really fast , which means that they can be planted and harvested all"
820,825,"within about ten years . Which , you know , sounds like a long time , but for a tree"
825,830,that 's fast . I just
830,835,"realized , there has to be so much planted , because if"
835,840,"trees grow in ten years , and we see"
840,845,"all those trucks full of trees ,"
845,850,there has to be so much .
850,855,But being there still did n't explain the shapes of
855,860,"these forests . So we sat down with Gonzalo Martinez Crosa , from INIA 's forestry"
860,865,"program , and asked him . I 'm curious if you can kind of describe why"
865,870,"plantations look the way they do , why they are"
870,875,"arranged in the shapes that they are , and the thinking that goes into it . So when you"
875,880,"plant big plants like trees , you need to take into consideration the"
880,885,"topography of the soil . So , usually these lines overall follow the"
885,890,topography . So that 's why sometimes they come up with these curious patterns of
890,895,"growing in curves , or spirals , or things like that ."
895,900,Contour lines . These forests followed the
900,905,curvature of the ground beneath them . Each concentric line in the fingerprint traced a slightly
905,910,"higher and higher level of elevation , until the incline came to"
910,915,"a peak , right here . These forests were"
915,920,"topographic maps , drawn with trees . And sometimes ,"
920,925,"yeah , the patterns that you get are very , very curious and very interesting"
925,930,to see from above . So that was it . Contour lines . Mystery
930,935,solved . Our job here was done . But I could n't get this one thing out of my head .
935,940,Something our guide had said .
955,960,Nothing else grows here . You
960,965,could tell . One of the first things I noticed is just how dead the ground is . Like
965,970,it 's all eucalyptus . All the dead leaves and branches . There was
970,975,nothing on the forest floor but dead leaves and fungi . No sounds except for machinery
975,980,"in the distance . These are monoculture tree farms , like those grown for palm oil"
980,985,or rubber . Not natural ecosystems . If vast areas of
985,990,"natural grasslands had been turned into tree farms where nothing else could grow , this “"
990,995,forestry miracle ” seemed more complicated than I 'd expected . I
995,1000,think we 've all heard of deforestation . We know what that looks like . We know why it 's bad .
1000,1005,"But the opposite of that , afforestation , planting a whole bunch of trees all at once . That"
1005,1010,"sounds like a good thing . If deforestation is a bad thing , afforestation sounds like a"
1010,1015,good thing . I want to figure out if that 's the right assumption about this .
1015,1020,"I found Alexandra Cravino , a"
1020,1025,biologist who uses camera traps to study how afforestation changes animal
1025,1030,populations .
1040,1045,"Compared to grasslands , her camera traps observed fewer kinds of species in firebreaks"
1045,1050,and even fewer in the
1050,1055,eucalyptus plantations themselves .
1075,1080,Companies like UPM say that they keep
1080,1085,"large portions of their land uncultivated , reserved for the natural ecosystems that were"
1085,1090,there before . And UPM says it 's had a system for detecting and protecting local species
1090,1095,"on its land since the early 1990s . But more and more , we were seeing"
1095,1100,that there was another side to this whole thing . Afforestation turned real grasslands
1100,1105,into artificial forests and that had consequences . Studies have found that afforested
1105,1110,"plantations reduce annual water yield , and can make soil less fertile and more"
1110,1115,"acidic . And while these trees absorb a lot of carbon while they 're alive , because they 're converted into"
1115,1120,"single - use paper products , much of that carbon is eventually re - released into the atmosphere when"
1120,1125,the paper eventually decomposes or is burned . It made us wonder
1125,1130,what harvesting looked like . So we followed an empty truck to
1130,1135,see where it led .
1140,1145,"It was shocking . Hectares of bare land , stacks of logs awaiting"
1145,1150,"transportation . It was a part of the process we had n't seen yet : where , after a"
1150,1155,"decade of growth , the trees are cut down , taken by truck to a mill , like"
1155,1160,"UPM ’s , and turned into pulp . And now we"
1160,1165,were curious what happened next . All of that pulp
1165,1170,"has to go somewhere . And Uruguay , working with outside investors , built a huge amount of"
1170,1175,infrastructure to transport and export pulp from the new UPM
1175,1180,plant . Starting with a new billion - dollar “ central
1180,1185,"railway , ” from the mill to the port , that was right about to be"
1185,1190,completed . We started to follow it south .
1190,1195,We 're driving right behind a truck full of
1195,1200,"wood pulp , which is all the stuff that , once this railroad right here"
1200,1205,"alongside us is complete , will be transported in trains instead of"
1205,1210,"in trucks . The railroad led us all the way back through Montevideo , past a new $"
1210,1215,"130 million viaduct for improved access to the sea , and to a $ 280"
1215,1220,"million port terminal just for loading truckloads of wood pulp onto ships ,"
1220,1225,most of which goes to Europe and China . Construction work for this
1225,1230,"infrastructure was everywhere , a lot of it covered in graffiti with messages like “"
1230,1235,"UPM get out . ” Because on its way to the port facility , the railroad cuts through"
1235,1240,"neighborhoods , causing disruptions that have angered nearby residents ."
1250,1255,"We 're on our way right now to the neighborhood of Capurro , which is one of the"
1255,1260,places that this new train is going to go directly through .
1300,1305,We were able to talk to one of those families whose home was destroyed to make
1305,1310,way for the train .
1325,1330,"In August 2018 , Nancy and Rodolfo received this letter from Uruguay 's Ministry of"
1330,1335,"Transport , saying that it was necessary to expropriate their property . But according to Nancy"
1335,1340,"and Rodolfo , they 're still waiting for financial compensation ."
1380,1385,This family 's story is n't unique in
1385,1390,Montevideo . And Uruguay ’s story is n't unique in the world . Other transnational
1390,1395,wood pulp corporations have planted eucalyptus all over the world : in
1395,1400,"Indonesia , Mozambique , Brazil ... These forests look similar , but exist in"
1400,1405,"ecosystems whose only trait in common is that they 're in countries where land is fertile ,"
1405,1410,"production is cheap , and wages are low compared to the Global"
1410,1415,"North . After a week in Uruguay , it was time for me to go . And going"
1415,1420,"through customs at the Montevideo airport , I had to scan my"
1420,1425,"fingerprint . And as we took off , I could see out of the plane window these forests I was"
1425,1430,leaving behind . This journey had taken us down a
1430,1435,"rabbit hole : from trying to understand one strange - looking forest , to"
1435,1440,trying to understand an industry that had reshaped an entire country . These forests
1440,1445,only exist because of the demands of the global economy . Uruguay does n't need all of
1445,1450,"these forests , but the world , for every kind of paper , cardboard , and tissue"
1450,1455,"product , does . While we were up north filming lumber trucks , I"
1455,1460,"stopped on the side of the road to watch some leafcutter ants . They were all going one way empty - handed , and the"
1460,1465,"other way carrying leaves . They take the leaf cuttings back to their nest , built"
1465,1470,"around a fungus . The ants feed the fungus leaves , and the fungus in return provides"
1470,1475,"food for the ant larvae . These trees , and trucks , and mills , and"
1475,1480,"trains , they 're all feeding ... something . Something that"
1480,1485,"reshapes landscapes , and lives , on"
1485,1490,"its way to becoming something that we interact with ,"
1490,1495,every day .
