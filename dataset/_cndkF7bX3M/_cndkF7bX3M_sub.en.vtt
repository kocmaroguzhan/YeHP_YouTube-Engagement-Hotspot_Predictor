00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:06.256
I'm in the middle of the countryside in Uruguay

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:09.467
trying to find this.

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:12.554
A forest shaped like a fingerprint.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.223
We're here because of a screenshot of Google Earth

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.809
that somebody posted to Reddit.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:20.812
In 2022, a Reddit user named tarek619 

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:26.901
found “strange DNA-like forests
spanning some 30 kilometers in Uruguay.”

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.153
I looked at the forest.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:32.782
I wasn't totally sure what was “DNA-like” about it,
but it was strange.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.617
And then I zoomed out.

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.787
And saw that it was just part of a whole array of forests,

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.415
all in mesmerizing designs.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.459
Then I zoomed out more.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.795
Forests like this covered the entire country.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.298
But I couldn't stop looking at this one.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.384
It looked like a fingerprint.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.387
From Street View, I could just barely make out what it was:

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.891
Long rows of identical trees.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.268
If I wanted to see inside one of these forests,

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:02.395
I would have to go see it for myself.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.481
So I went.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:08.318
And discovered something much more complex than I expected.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.154
But it all started with one question:

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:15.617
Why did this forest
look like a fingerprint?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.876
Before I left, I started with some
highly advanced research methods.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:26.377
And I started reading.

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:28.421
According to a Uruguayan government report,

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:32.175
about 1 million of Uruguay's 17 million hectares of land

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.512
are covered with pine and eucalyptus plantations.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:36.888
Tree farms.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.973
Artificial forests.

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:42.811
That's why they were planted in these rows of identical trees.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.940
Reading more, I learned that the majority
of those trees are turned into pulp.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.901
Not pulp like orange juice, pulp like wood pulp:

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.237
Soft, wet, chemically-separated cellulose

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:56.157
that becomes the main ingredient in making paper products:

00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:59.536
Printing paper, paper towels, toilet paper,

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.746
napkins, anything.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:04.833
And according to the very first result on Google search,

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.085
these forests were a “miracle.”

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.629
On a continent devastated by deforestation,

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.673
Uruguay was one of the few countries 

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:15.260
where forest cover had actually expanded.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.096
It sounded like a massive accomplishment.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.931
These strikingly arranged forests

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.601
appeared to be part of some nationwide project.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.270
If it really was a miracle,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.188
I had to see it.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:41.244
After three flights, to Miami and then to Lima,

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:44.080
I have finally made it to Montevideo.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.710
I am sitting in traffic right now,
waiting to pick up Faustina Bartaburu.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.295
Hey, how's it going?

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.255
She's a journalist based here in Montevideo.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.048
I'll be there in like 5 minutes.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.926
Between finding the forests on Google Earth and coming here,

00:02:56.926 --> 00:03:01.890
I'd connected with her to help us find experts in Uruguay.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.643
Experts who could help us learn more about the forests.

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:08.938
Starting with a representative from the forestry industry.

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.323
That's “afforestation.”

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:22.327
Not reforestation, where trees are restored to a depleted forest,

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:27.081
but where trees are planted in a place
where no trees existed before.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:41.137
Just 40 years ago, these forests weren't here at all.

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.932
In 1987, the Uruguayan government passed a law

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:46.434
that protected the country's native forests,

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:50.939
but also declared a “national interest”
in developing new “forestry resources,”

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.275
“forestry industries,” and a “forestry economy.”

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:58.321
The law set the stage for a boom for the forestry industry.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:02.158
All over the country, the transformation was dramatic.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.336
Today, Uruguay has more plantation forest cover
than native forest cover,

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:17.632
and the country's wood pulp industry employs thousands of people.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.510
Wood pulp has become Uruguay's second-biggest export,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.972
totaling over $2 billion in 2023,

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.975
and it's on the verge of becoming the biggest.

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.518
Uruguay created an industry

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.771
that has radically reshaped the country's landscape,

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.482
but also its economy.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.882
We had a basic understanding of why the forests were there.

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:04.762
So we met up with a videographer and drone operator
who would help us document the journey,

00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:08.558
and we set off to find the fingerprint.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.563
We're just about an hour north of Montevideo right now,

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:17.734
and you can already start to see
all of these plantations dotting the horizon.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:24.991
We are on our way to try to find that fingerprint.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.577
Yeah, I mean, at this point, we don't know

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.579
what it's going to look like,

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.664
if it's going to look anything like the satellite image.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.374
I mean, these trees could have been cut.

00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:35.001
They could have grown in a way

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.254
that the pattern is kind of hard to recognize now...

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.506
Anything could have changed.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:44.552
I really want to see the shapes from above.

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:45.219
Yeah.

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.306
I've never been this excited to see some trees in my life.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.936
We must be getting close, right?

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:54.771
Yeah.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:03.863
We are here.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:04.697
Cool.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:05.698
We made it.

00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:12.914
I mean, I know it's not natural,

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:16.167
but it seems somehow natural.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.127
It's great. You want to see it?

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:19.462
I do. I do.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.590
Wow.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.635
Crazy.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:28.846
It's like the perfect match.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.477
There it was.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:35.978
A perfect fingerprint shape,

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:40.024
exactly like we'd seen on the Internet.

00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:44.070
Made up of thousands of trees.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.037
And surrounded by forest after forest

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:56.624
in the same kind of design.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:02.380
But there was a problem.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.631
We wanted to go inside.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.843
And every forest we’d passed was completely inaccessible.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:12.223
There's a lot of fences, so think it'll be hard to get inside.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.307
It was frustrating.

00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:14.434
We didn't want to trespass.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.853
And after traveling all this way, it wasn't clear

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:20.982
if we'd be able to see much more than this.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:21.941
But then down the road,

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.819
we saw a sign on one of those fences.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:25.945
INIA.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:29.782
The country's National Institute for Agricultural Research.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:33.494
We sent them an email asking if they could get us inside.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:37.748
But as we drove around the area, something else caught our eye.

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:38.916
Wood trucks.

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:41.419
They were everywhere.

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:48.634
There's another one.

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:50.761
There's another one.

00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:53.681
There's another one.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:58.060
Hundreds of trucks full of logs going one direction,

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.106
empty trucks going the other direction.

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:03.774
As the sun set,

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:09.405
we decided to follow them.

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:13.743
We're going to try to follow the trucks that are full of trees

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.828
to see where they're going.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.671
After driving in the dark for an hour and a half,

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:27.757
we saw where they were going.

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:35.306
We’d arrived in Paso de los Toros.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:41.646
It's the home of one of the biggest wood pulp mills in the world,

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:44.440
owned by a company called UPM.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.363
They had written that first article I saw
about Uruguay's “forestry miracle.”

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:53.866
The construction of this mill was major national news.

00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:08.339
UPM’s facility here is massive.

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:11.676
Its size rivals that of the city of Paso de los Toros itself,

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.803
a small town of 13,000 people.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.956
Fernando also told us about a really specific change

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.624
that had occurred in the town.

00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:02.560
Little Helsinki.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.312
It's a neighborhood in Paso de los Toros

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.939
where high-level UPM employees live.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:08.357
We drove over to see it.

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:11.485
Just a few blocks from a town that mostly looked like this,

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:14.947
were these long rows of identical homes,

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:19.285
straight out of an architectural design magazine.

00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:22.288
It's physical evidence of the ties

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.832
this community has to somewhere else,

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:27.043
somewhere very far away.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:30.796
Because UPM isn't from Uruguay, or from South America,

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.715
but from Finland.

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:37.386
UPM, a Finnish company, is
one of the largest landowners in Uruguay,

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:44.060
owning almost 30% of Uruguay's
1.1 million hectares of forest plantations.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.478
The construction of this pulp mill

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:49.065
was the single largest investment in the history of UPM,

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.943
and the single largest foreign investment
in the history of Uruguay: 

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:54.945
Over $3 billion.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:01.744
Standing outside the mill,

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:05.873
we could see full trucks driving in, empty trucks driving out.

00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:10.294
But we later learned that that's not all that's happening here.

00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:15.299
Because these trucks are driving out of land
subject to Uruguay's normal tax laws,

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:17.927
and into a “tax-free zone” that the Uruguayan government

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:20.680
set up just for this pulp mill.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.516
It's not just company property, it's an economic space

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:28.020
the government created to stimulate forestry production.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.189
UPM is just one of several companies

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:32.650
involved in forestry production here,

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.236
but it runs two of the country's three mills

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:38.447
for processing eucalyptus into pulp.

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:41.659
Together, these mills turn 17 million tons of wood 

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:45.413
into 4.8 million tons of pulp every year, 

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:49.333
each within their own “free trade zone.”

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:50.751
We reached out to UPM,

00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:54.505
hoping to talk to someone from the company
while we were in Paso de los Toros.

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:58.926
But after a short back and forth,
they stopped responding to our emails.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.430
Then, INIA got back to us.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.765
They were able to get us inside a forest.

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:09.979
Not the fingerprint forest, but a similar plantation
they use for research purposes.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:16.110
We hoped the visit could help us learn more
about why they look that way.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.612
We met the guide from INIA, Federico,

00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:21.824
and suited up: vests for visibility,

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:24.034
shin guards to protect against snakes,

00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:26.078
and helmets in case of falling debris.

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:30.374
I have a really big head, so this might be hard.

00:12:30.374 --> 00:12:32.460
Then we headed inside.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.271
It's colder here.

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.314
Yeah.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:58.778
You definitely notice the temperature change.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.198
Finally, we were inside one of these forests.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:06.786
We'd seen them from above, and now we were seeing one up close.

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.746
Seeing, touching,

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:12.249
smelling the habitat we’d traveled all this way to experience.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.063
These eucalyptus trees are not native to Uruguay.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.105
They're from Australia.

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:37.399
But they grow really, really, really fast,

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.692
which means that they can be planted

00:13:38.692 --> 00:13:41.320
and harvested all within about ten years.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.949
Which, you know, sounds like a long time, but for a tree

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.325
that's fast.

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:50.371
I just realized,

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:53.207
there has to be so much planted,

00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:58.337
because if trees grow in ten years,

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:04.468
and we see all those trucks full of trees,

00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:07.847
there has to be so much.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.729
But being there still didn't explain the shapes of these forests.

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:18.190
So we sat down with Gonzalo Martinez Crosa,

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.485
from INIA's forestry program, and asked him.

00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:24.238
I'm curious if you can kind of describe 

00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:28.576
why plantations look the way they do,

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:32.538
 why they are arranged in the shapes that they are,

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:33.914
and the thinking that goes into it.

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:37.334
So when you plant big plants like trees,

00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:40.963
you need to take into consideration the topography of the soil.

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:45.551
So, usually these lines overall follow the topography.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.722
So that's why sometimes they come up with these curious patterns

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:54.143
of growing in curves, or spirals, or things like that.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:58.355
Contour lines.

00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:01.567
These forests followed the curvature of the ground beneath them.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.986
Each concentric line in the fingerprint traced

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.989
a slightly higher and higher level of elevation,

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:11.827
until the incline came to a peak, right here.

00:15:11.827 --> 00:15:17.708
These forests were topographic maps, drawn with trees.

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:21.503
And sometimes, yeah, the patterns that you get

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:26.258
are very, very curious and very interesting to see from above.

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:27.217
So that was it.

00:15:27.217 --> 00:15:28.427
Contour lines.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.429
Mystery solved.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:32.348
Our job here was done.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.850
But I couldn't get this one thing out of my head.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.062
Something our guide had said.

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.166
Nothing else grows here.

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:00.626
You could tell.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:04.546
One of the first things I noticed is just how dead the ground is.

00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:06.674
Like it's all eucalyptus.

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:09.134
All the dead leaves and branches.

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:12.388
There was nothing on the forest floor but dead leaves and fungi.

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:16.058
No sounds except for machinery in the distance.

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:17.893
These are monoculture tree farms,

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:20.646
like those grown for palm oil or rubber.

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:23.315
Not natural ecosystems.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:26.026
If vast areas of natural grasslands

00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:29.530
had been turned into tree farms where nothing else could grow,

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:34.660
this “forestry miracle” seemed more complicated than I'd expected.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.329
I think we've all heard of deforestation.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.288
We know what that looks like.

00:16:38.288 --> 00:16:39.999
We know why it's bad.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.333
But the opposite of that,

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:44.586
afforestation, planting a whole bunch of trees all at once.

00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:46.588
That sounds like a good thing.

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:50.551
If deforestation is a bad thing, afforestation
sounds like a good thing.

00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:53.846
I want to figure out if that's the right assumption about this.

00:16:58.308 --> 00:16:59.893
I found Alexandra Cravino,

00:16:59.893 --> 00:17:02.229
a biologist who uses camera traps to study

00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:05.524
how afforestation changes animal populations.

00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:24.543
Compared to grasslands, her camera traps
observed fewer kinds of species in firebreaks

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:27.963
(those are the preserved areas of grassland
in between the new forests)

00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:32.301
and even fewer in the eucalyptus plantations themselves.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:02.039
Companies like UPM say that they keep
large portions of their land uncultivated,

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:05.626
reserved for the natural ecosystems that were there before.

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:08.587
And UPM says it's had a system for detecting and protecting

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:13.175
local species on its land since the early 1990s.

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:17.262
But more and more, we were seeing
that there was another side to this whole thing.

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:21.266
Afforestation turned real grasslands into artificial forests

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:23.018
and that had consequences.

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:26.980
Studies have found that afforested plantations
reduce annual water yield,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.359
and can make soil less fertile and more acidic.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.529
And while these trees absorb a lot of carbon while they're alive,

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:36.115
because they're converted into single-use paper products,

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:39.576
much of that carbon is eventually re-released into the atmosphere

00:18:39.576 --> 00:18:43.914
when the paper eventually decomposes or is burned.

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.583
It made us wonder what harvesting looked like.

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:51.190
So we followed an empty truck to see where it led.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:01.515
It was shocking.

00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:05.936
Hectares of bare land, stacks of logs awaiting transportation.

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:08.856
It was a part of the process we hadn't seen yet:

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.691
where, after a decade of growth,

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:15.362
the trees are cut down, taken by truck to a mill, like UPM’s,

00:19:15.362 --> 00:19:18.615
and turned into pulp.

00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:23.954
And now we were curious what happened next.

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:26.248
All of that pulp has to go somewhere.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:28.709
And Uruguay, working with outside investors,

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:31.461
built a huge amount of infrastructure to transport

00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:35.048
and export pulp from the new UPM plant.

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:41.638
Starting with a new billion-dollar
“central railway,” from the mill to the port,

00:19:41.638 --> 00:19:45.017
that was right about to be completed.

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.269
We started to follow it south.

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:54.276
We're driving right behind a truck

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.904
full of wood pulp, which is all the stuff that,

00:19:56.904 --> 00:20:01.325
once this railroad right here alongside us is complete,

00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:05.746
will be transported in trains instead of in trucks.

00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:08.916
The railroad led us all the way back through Montevideo,

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:13.921
past a new $130 million viaduct for improved access to the sea,

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:16.632
and to a $280 million port terminal

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.801
just for loading truckloads of wood pulp onto ships,

00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:22.930
most of which goes to Europe and China.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.974
Construction work for this infrastructure was everywhere,

00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:27.684
a lot of it covered in graffiti 

00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:31.146
with messages like “UPM get out.”

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:33.523
Because on its way to the port facility,

00:20:33.523 --> 00:20:35.317
the railroad cuts through neighborhoods,

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:38.278
causing disruptions that have angered nearby residents.

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:53.252
We're on our way right now to the neighborhood of Capurro,

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:56.380
which is one of the places that this new train

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.216
is going to go directly through.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.092
We were able to talk to one of those families

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:46.471
whose home was destroyed to make way for the train.

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:06.074
In August 2018,

00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:08.076
Nancy and Rodolfo received this letter

00:22:08.076 --> 00:22:10.287
from Uruguay's Ministry of Transport,

00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:13.957
saying that it was necessary to expropriate their property.

00:22:13.957 --> 00:22:15.459
But according to Nancy and Rodolfo,

00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:18.253
they're still waiting for financial compensation.

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:05.384
This family's story isn't unique in Montevideo.

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:08.887
And Uruguay’s story isn't unique in the world.

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:10.889
Other transnational wood pulp corporations 

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:13.350
have planted eucalyptus all over the world:

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.479
 in Indonesia, Mozambique, Brazil...

00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:20.440
These forests look similar, but exist in ecosystems

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.984
whose only trait in common is that they're in countries

00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:25.821
where land is fertile, production is cheap,

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:30.117
and wages are low compared to the Global North.

00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:34.371
After a week in Uruguay, it was time for me to go.

00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:36.915
And going through customs at the Montevideo airport,

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:40.127
I had to scan my fingerprint.

00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:41.086
And as we took off,

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:45.966
I could see out of the plane window
these forests I was leaving behind.

00:23:48.301 --> 00:23:50.595
This journey had taken us down a rabbit hole:

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:54.433
from trying to understand one strange-looking forest,

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:59.020
to trying to understand an industry
that had reshaped an entire country.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.233
These forests only exist because of
the demands of the global economy.

00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:05.527
Uruguay doesn't need all of these forests,

00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:08.447
but the world, for every kind of paper, cardboard,

00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:11.158
and tissue product, does.

00:24:12.826 --> 00:24:14.494
While we were up north filming lumber trucks,

00:24:14.494 --> 00:24:17.789
I stopped on the side of the road to watch some leafcutter ants.

00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:19.166
They were all going one way empty-handed,

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.793
and the other way carrying leaves.

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:25.505
They take the leaf cuttings back to their nest, built around a fungus.

00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:27.674
The ants feed the fungus leaves, and the fungus

00:24:27.674 --> 00:24:32.137
in return provides food for the ant larvae.

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:32.929
These trees,

00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:33.763
and trucks,

00:24:33.763 --> 00:24:34.598
and mills,

00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:35.223
and trains,

00:24:35.223 --> 00:24:38.018
they're all feeding... something.

00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:42.063
Something that reshapes landscapes,

00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:44.608
and lives,

00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:49.237
on its way to becoming something that we interact with,

00:24:49.237 --> 00:24:50.989
every day.
