60.32,61.43,Are you ready? I feel like I'm going to
61.44,64.07,my pants already. Is that a bad

107.52,109.429,pretty It's pretty good.
109.439,111.91,"So, last season you actually stopped by"
111.92,114.789,a Hot One Shoot for moral support for
114.799,117.27,your longtime friend and Ash co-star Asa
117.28,120.23,"Gonzalez. Uh, what a what a an amazing"
120.24,122.789,person. She said this wasn't really the
122.799,125.109,dangerous part. It was the aftermath.
125.119,129.27,"How is your situation, you know? I think"
129.28,131.51,I'm good. I think I'm battle tested. You
131.52,132.869,know what I mean? I think there's a
132.879,135.11,"strength that builds up, a tolerance"
135.12,137.03,"that builds up, and now I'm on like a"
137.04,138.949,superhuman level. Is that like a self
138.959,141.99,diagnosis? It's my belief. It's what I
142.0,144.15,want to be true. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
144.16,145.79,"Well, that works. Exactly. It's the"
145.8,148.71,placebo. Yes. Yes. Very strong. Okay.
148.72,151.11,And then what's it like to watch Hot
151.12,153.589,"Ones from a spectator perspective? Like,"
153.599,155.27,does it make you any more or less
155.28,157.19,interested in actually doing the show?
157.2,158.949,It must have worked a little bit because
158.959,161.03,"you're here today. I'm here. You know, I"
161.04,164.15,was always very nervous. I didn't think
164.16,166.79,I wanted to be on this show. I love the
166.8,170.949,show as you know. Um but watching Asa
170.959,174.39,"tackle it, you know, um firsthand and"
174.4,176.71,then hanging out with you and trying
176.72,180.07,"some of the sauces, I I got the courage,"
180.08,183.589,you know. Um but I'm honestly I'm a
183.599,186.229,"little I'm fine with this one, but I'm a"
186.239,189.43,little nervous to get to them. But
189.44,190.869,that's all right. Let's just take the
190.879,193.589,"wins where we get them, one step at a"
193.599,196.3,"time. M. Cheers to you. Salude, my"
200.84,203.309,friend. M. It's
203.319,206.07,nice. It's sneaking in. There's a
206.08,207.509,smokiness to it that kind of comes
207.519,208.71,"through. Yeah, it's not that bad. I"
208.72,211.91,would I would have this on a daily
211.92,214.71,"a daily basis for sure. Well, you can"
214.72,216.47,you're going to take this with you? Of
216.48,218.07,course. The whole lineup. It's the least
218.08,220.39,"we can do. Aaron, that's really good."
220.4,222.509,That's really good. Look at you. seed
222.519,225.11,"ranch. Just winging it, crushing it."
226.36,229.43,"job. That's great. So, you're coming to"
229.44,231.509,Hollywood story is the classic dreamers
231.519,233.43,"tale. You know, this theater kid from"
233.44,235.75,Idaho packing up his Toyota Corolla and
235.76,238.229,then making the trip over to LA. Yeah.
238.239,241.19,Is there a failed pilot that at the time
241.2,243.19,"when you were cast in it, you were"
243.2,245.11,confident that it would be your big
245.12,247.509,break in star vehicle to stardom? Oh
247.519,249.11,"god. You know what? to be honest, every"
249.12,251.91,pilot you think you think is going to be
251.92,254.149,"your cuz you do the contracts, you know"
254.159,256.789,what you're getting each episode. It's
256.799,259.99,"like a guaranteed job every week,"
260.0,263.11,"weekend, week out. Um, but they tease"
263.12,266.95,"you. I mean, I remember after Friends,"
266.96,269.35,the creators of Friends were doing their
269.36,271.83,next show. It was already picked up for
271.84,273.749,"two seasons. It was going to be, they"
273.759,275.67,were saying the next big Friends. I
275.68,277.43,"mean, everybody, all my friends that"
277.44,279.67,were actors were trying out for it and
279.68,282.629,"everybody really wanted it. Um, and I"
282.639,285.67,tested for a role with studio with me
285.68,287.83,and three guys and then I went to
287.84,290.71,network against me and another person
290.72,292.629,and then I didn't get it. But then they
292.639,295.11,had me audition for another role and I
295.12,297.189,went to studio and then I went to
297.199,299.59,network with me and another person and I
299.6,302.629,didn't get it. And I was I can't tell
302.639,306.31,you how depressed I was for just way too
306.32,309.029,long. Um but if I were to get and it the
309.039,311.189,the show was good. I mean it lasted
311.199,313.51,about a season and a half and you know
313.52,315.87,some people liked it but it wasn't
315.88,319.35,Prince show. It was called The Class. Um
319.36,322.15,and then if I were to have done that
322.16,324.79,show I wouldn't have been available to
324.8,327.51,"audition for Breaking Bad. So, you know,"
327.52,329.43,"the point of the story, you never know"
329.44,331.11,"what's right around the corner, you"
331.12,333.189,"know. So, just keep keep pounding the"
333.199,338.71,pavement. Yeah.
338.72,340.629,This is yours. You're not the only one
340.639,344.83,"in the food game, Aaron."
344.84,348.07,That's That's another one I would love
348.08,352.39,to have. It's not bad. It's pretty good.
352.4,354.23,"Sier, what took you so long? I'm feeling"
354.24,356.39,"pretty confident. You know, it's"
356.4,358.23,probably false confidence because we
358.24,361.07,"have, you know, seven more. But it's all"
361.08,363.43,right. I'm holding on to my false
363.44,365.749,confidence. Do you have an all-time
365.759,368.23,favorite or even most perturbing Brian
368.24,370.15,Cranston prank from all of the years
370.16,371.59,that you've spent sharing a set with
371.6,373.99,"him? Let me tell you. I mean, he's been"
374.0,376.629,"on here a couple times, so you know him."
376.639,378.43,I always
378.44,381.39,say he's the hardest worker in the
381.4,384.39,"room. The most lovable. I mean, he's my"
384.4,386.79,"best friend, my son's godfather. I I"
386.8,388.87,adore him. I spoke to him for an hour on
388.88,391.029,"the phone last night. I mean, I I really"
391.039,393.67,"am obsessed with the guy, but he's also"
393.68,395.59,the most immature person I've ever met
395.6,397.35,in my life. And I say that with just
397.36,400.79,"love and respect. I mean, the list was"
400.8,403.029,"endless. But I remember on Breaking Bad,"
403.039,404.95,"he came out of the production office,"
404.96,408.95,"came up to me and he goes, ""Come here."
408.96,410.87,"It's okay."" And he gives me this long"
410.88,413.99,"hug. I'm like, ""What are you doing?"""
414.0,416.87,"He's like, ""At least you go out in a big"
416.88,419.43,"way, huh?"" And I'm like, ""What are you"
419.44,421.029,"talking about?"" He goes, ""Did you read"
421.039,424.469,"the latest script?"" I go, ""No."" He goes,"
424.479,427.99,"""Oh, well, just read it and I'm here if"
428.0,429.99,"you need me."" You know? I was like,"
430.0,431.99,"""Okay."" Okay. So, I sprinted into the"
432.0,433.909,"production office. I go, ""Wait, Brian"
433.919,435.909,read the light latest script. What
435.919,437.909,"happens?"" You know, I want to read it."
437.919,439.83,"And then, of course, I just go to the"
439.84,442.87,"final, you know, the final pages and"
442.88,444.87,nothing happened. I'm still around. But
444.88,446.99,he just made it made it seem like I
447.0,450.79,"died. Um, but he would not stop. He"
450.8,452.39,would not stop and he would get
452.4,455.909,everybody in on it. like the um uh
455.919,457.83,"costume designers said, ""Hey, look, we"
457.84,459.749,"got to do your measurements for, you"
459.759,462.469,"know, the the the casket."" And uh so if"
462.479,465.189,"you could stay after after work, um that"
465.199,467.029,"would be great. Uh I'm like, ""What are"
467.039,469.43,"you talking about?"" Um but this is all"
469.44,472.15,"this is all him. Um but yeah, but I I"
472.16,475.29,made it. I made
478.039,481.189,it. It's doing like a little vibrating
481.199,484.23,in my mouth. It definitely has a bit of
484.24,487.27,depth that the um other ones did not.
487.28,489.83,It's sort of a charring quality. You
489.84,492.23,"know what? Yeah, charring is a good"
494.479,496.79,Sometimes I'll hear actors talk about
496.8,499.35,circling days on the production calendar
499.36,501.43,for scenes that they're dreading doing.
501.44,503.35,Right. I'm wondering when you think
503.36,505.189,about the pages that you looked at that
505.199,507.029,"put you into a mental tail spin, does"
507.039,509.029,anything immediately come to mind? Oh
510.12,513.43,"Um, there's I for some reason I'm always"
513.44,515.75,doing roles that are just getting beat
515.76,517.67,up and tortured. You know what I mean? I
517.68,519.589,don't know what that that says about
519.599,521.829,"you, right?"
521.839,523.589,"I don't know what that says about me,"
523.599,526.55,but um it would have to go back to a
526.56,529.19,Breaking Bad episode. There's a a scene
529.2,532.07,where Jesse wakes up and his his
532.08,536.79,girlfriend Jane is uh is dead. And I was
536.8,540.63,terrified to shoot that scene. I just I
540.64,543.03,I had this love and complicated
543.04,544.87,relationship. It was such a chemical
544.88,546.949,"romance, but he was just so in it, you"
546.959,549.91,"know, all in. Really felt very in love,"
549.92,552.31,but didn't realize that she was just
552.32,555.269,"destroying him. Um, I mean, they were"
555.279,557.509,"destroying themselves together, but I"
557.519,560.389,was I was very nervous to tackle that
560.399,562.31,"scene. Um, and I didn't know what to do."
562.32,564.31,"I didn't I I didn't really rehearse it,"
564.32,565.99,you know. I just knew I had to put
566.0,569.19,"myself in that position as that guy. Um,"
569.2,572.79,"and so what you saw is what you saw. Um,"
572.8,578.59,it was brutal.
578.6,581.99,Yeah. Should we bust out the caviar? Let
582.0,584.79,me just let me Can I come to your side?
584.8,586.91,"Yeah, you come do Yeah. I like this uh"
586.92,589.59,"tableside service. You just got to, you"
589.6,593.99,"know, let's just do a dollop. Um, that's"
594.0,596.63,"a good, you know, we're halfway there."
596.64,598.31,We made it. It's a touch of class that
598.32,601.11,"this show needs, Aaron. For real. I'm"
601.12,603.11,"here for you. You know, we're keeping"
603.12,606.23,"things classy here on Hot Ones. Um, and"
606.24,607.91,you let me know when you want more. You
607.92,610.15,"know what I mean? I will do. Um, cheers,"
610.16,614.6,buddy. Cheers.
619.399,623.829,"works. It works. You saw it here, folks."
623.839,626.63,"It works. So, I understand that there"
626.64,629.11,are very few visual effects used for the
629.12,631.11,car stunt scenes in Need for Speed. I'm
631.12,632.87,"wondering, did you have a most harrowing"
632.88,634.87,moment behind the wheel shooting an
634.88,637.269,"action sequence for that film? Oh man,"
637.279,641.43,there was this one uh scene that I was
641.44,644.47,"practicing, rehearsing for from day one,"
644.48,646.43,and we didn't shoot the scene until
646.44,649.829,midway through um the shoot. And the
649.839,651.99,scene is something very traumatic
652.0,653.99,"happens. One of his best friends, his"
654.0,657.67,car flips over a bridge and it's very
657.68,660.47,clear that this guy is either instantly
660.48,663.67,dead or he's in danger. And so I have to
663.68,666.15,flip around in my car. He wants to do
666.16,669.59,this in one shot. And the shot is flying
669.6,673.35,"towards the camera, doing a skid up to"
673.36,675.59,"the camera, and then I have to open up"
675.6,678.79,the door and then run to my friend. And
678.8,681.269,"Scotty goes, ""Don't worry about it. I'm"
681.279,683.509,"going to act as the camera operator, and"
683.519,685.79,"if you hit me, doesn't"
685.8,688.389,"matter."" She's like, ""Got it."" Okay."
688.399,689.829,"Yeah. So, if I hit you, it doesn't"
689.839,692.87,"matter. Okay. Um, so, uh, the first take"
692.88,696.55,"out of the gates, I come up so short,"
696.56,698.389,"it's embarrassing. He goes, ""I'm being"
698.399,700.47,"serious. If you hit me, don't worry"
700.48,703.43,"about it."" Um, and then the second take,"
703.44,706.47,"I come up, I come this far from the guy."
706.48,707.91,And that's what you see in the movie.
707.92,710.069,But there's a lot of lot I nailed it.
710.079,712.87,"Um, uh, a lot of pressure there, you"
718.959,720.269,"Let's go,"
720.279,724.47,baby. This is not bad. I was actually I
724.48,726.55,was hoping I would start to start
726.56,728.87,"sweating by now. I mean, I know I know"
728.88,730.629,"I'm I'm going to get there, but this is"
730.639,733.389,this is very manageable. It's very
733.399,736.55,manageable. It's great. I'm into it.
738.399,739.91,"So, listening to a lot of your old"
739.92,741.43,"interviews, a throughine that comes"
741.44,743.03,through pretty consistently is your
743.04,745.03,proclivity towards what you describe as
745.04,747.75,gritty indie drama. Outside of your own
747.76,749.91,"films, what are the gritty indie dramas"
749.92,752.87,that left the biggest impact on you?
752.88,754.47,Maybe this is picking up on me. You
755.639,758.79,maybe I actually You know what? It's
758.8,762.069,it's it's talking. You start talking.
762.079,764.55,Yeah. Yeah. And I'm I'm realizing I'm
764.56,766.31,kind of sweating a little bit.
766.32,768.47,"self-fulfilling prophecy on the show,"
768.48,772.55,"right? Um, indie dramas. I mean, Stand"
772.56,775.11,by Me. Beautiful film. Changed my life
775.12,777.59,"when I watched it. Um, wow. It's It's"
777.6,779.99,"hitting my my head sweating, right?"
780.0,781.509,Yeah. And that's just the beginning.
781.519,786.87,"Does your head sweat? I mean,"
786.88,789.35,I don't see it sweating. I can feel I
789.36,791.91,can feel it sweating. You know what I'm
791.92,793.11,"saying? Right. Yeah. Like, I have"
793.12,794.87,"nothing to cover. I mean, I always have"
794.88,796.949,a shaved head. I love it. Well done. You
796.959,798.79,"rock it well. You're a handsome man, by"
798.8,800.389,"the way. When you have that shaved head,"
800.399,801.75,"when you have that shaved head, you're a"

1018.12,1022.629,"hot inside of my mouth. No. I know. So,"
1022.639,1024.789,how would you distill the experience of
1024.799,1026.47,being a contestant on the Price is
1026.48,1028.63,Right? Because when I watch your 2000
1028.64,1030.15,"appearance, which has millions of views"
1030.16,1032.069,"on YouTube, it seems like such an"
1032.079,1034.309,"emotional roller coaster. You know, the"
1034.319,1037.429,excitement of accurately ballparking an
1037.439,1040.309,elegant flat top desk and then you're on
1040.319,1042.87,"the show, right?"
1042.88,1046.309,And then you get a showcase and then you
1046.319,1049.19,over bid by just a few hundred. You
1049.2,1051.11,"know, how dare you bring that up? You"
1051.12,1052.87,"know, is that something that gives you"
1052.88,1055.029,sleepless nights afterwards or was it
1055.039,1057.75,just cool to be on the show? It was
1057.76,1061.51,"great to be on. I was struggling. Um, I"
1061.52,1063.029,needed money and it was You could have
1063.039,1065.51,used that sports car. I could have used
1065.52,1069.59,"that car, right? And I was so depressed"
1069.6,1071.95,when I bid
1071.96,1075.51,$132 over and then my buddy actually
1075.52,1078.31,stayed. They did two tapings that day
1078.32,1081.669,and he won the showcase showdown. He won
1081.679,1085.19,"a trip to Fiji, New Orleans and uh"
1085.2,1087.27,London. Um I went to New Orleans with
1087.28,1090.63,him so it was fine. With the power of
1090.64,1092.95,"the bomb coursing through your veins,"
1092.96,1096.39,I'm wondering if you can make a bid as
1096.4,1101.31,close to the MSRP actual price of this
1101.32,1105.27,2024 Chevy Camaro without going over.
1105.28,1109.15,Oh. without going over
1109.16,1114.63,"2024. Uh $34,695."
1119.36,1121.75,It's irresponsible of all of you not to

1156.0,1158.31,and was reading in a 2018 interview
1158.32,1160.23,about how you'll sometimes reach out to
1160.24,1162.549,tour managers to see if an artist is
1162.559,1164.549,available to perform a concert in your

1253.44,1256.87,even mean I see what you did there. I
1256.88,1258.789,did not even mean the last dab
1258.799,1260.789,experience. I did not even mean to make
1260.799,1262.549,that kind of connection. I did not mean
1262.559,1265.43,to make that connection. Did you not? I
1265.44,1267.99,"really didn't. Aaron Paul, you've taken"
1268.0,1270.63,on the wings of death. You've survived.
1270.64,1272.71,"I don't want it to be over, John. Things"
1272.72,1275.43,out. What I want to do is hit you with
1275.44,1278.31,some pull quotes from Brian Cranston's
1278.32,1280.549,classic Hot Ones interview from just a
1280.559,1283.51,"few years ago. Okay. He says, ""If a"
1283.52,1286.07,"character cries easily, the audience"
1286.08,1288.31,doesn't have to. But if a character
1288.32,1290.63,"tries not to cry, that's when the"
1290.64,1295.35,"audience will."" Oh, interesting. I I"
1295.36,1298.51,feel that you know you're really getting
1298.52,1300.35,into the
1300.36,1302.31,person. It's hitting me. This is
1302.32,1304.029,actually it's creeping on
1304.039,1306.87,me. The descent into magic. It's one of
1306.88,1309.99,those things that you feel like you've
1313.4,1317.07,victorious and then your face is on
1317.08,1320.07,fire. You wave your hands in celebration
1320.08,1321.83,as you approach the finish line. And
1321.84,1324.149,then you fall on your face. Break your
1324.159,1326.87,nose. That's what happens. He said that
1326.88,1329.75,you encouraged him to snack on the meth
1329.76,1332.07,"on set, which is made up of cotton"
1332.08,1334.87,candy. Rock candy. Can you confirm or
1334.88,1336.95,deny that? I can confirm all of that. I
1336.96,1339.83,would I would sling that meth to anyone
1339.84,1342.07,"that walked onto that set. Now, I got to"
1342.08,1344.789,be honest. I actually stole as much meth
1344.799,1347.19,"from that show as possible, but I wish I"
1347.2,1349.35,stole more things. You know what I mean?
1349.36,1351.11,Yeah. Some keep taking some things. The
1351.12,1352.63,"rule of thumb when you're doing, you"
1352.64,1355.27,"know, work in this industry, just steal"
1357.039,1360.149,Don't Don't ask because they'll say no.
1360.159,1363.51,They will say no. Yeah. Just steal it
1363.52,1365.99,and they'll get over it. One more for
1366.0,1368.95,"you. He says this, ""A love of acting is"
1368.96,1371.43,a relationship. It's not a fling. It's
1371.44,1372.95,committing to something for the rest of
1372.96,1375.27,"your life."" You know what? I I love"
1375.28,1379.029,"that. And it's true. It's true. Um, I"
1379.039,1382.31,"always say and he says it, if you want"
1382.32,1384.63,"to do it, you will be doing it. If"
1384.64,1388.23,"people come up to you and say, ""Hey, I"
1388.24,1390.149,"want some advice."" You know, it's like a"
1390.159,1392.87,35year-old man. I want to be an actor.
1392.88,1395.39,"Well, are you acting?"
1395.4,1398.07,"No. Well, then don't do it. What do you"
1398.08,1402.23,"You know, my I I I'm going to throw up."
1402.24,1405.669,"I'm that hell, it's so hot, Aaron. But"
1405.679,1408.39,I'm okay. I'm okay. Taking on the wings
1408.4,1410.549,"of death, living to tell the tale, and"
1410.559,1411.909,now there's nothing left to do but roll
1411.919,1413.75,"out the red carpet for you. This camera,"
1413.76,1415.27,"this camera, this camera. Let the people"
1415.28,1416.47,know what you have going on in your
1416.48,1419.11,life. Be careful around the eyes. Oh
1419.12,1421.59,"god. Um, what's up everybody? How's it"
1421.6,1423.75,"going? If you're thirsty, drink some do"
1423.76,1427.19,"ombre. If you're hungry, eat some of the"
1427.2,1430.31,"only caviar. Um, that's all I got to"
1430.32,1432.71,"say. Uh, lots of love. Thank you so much"
1432.72,1435.51,for having me. I You know what? The
1435.52,1437.99,entire show I tried not to stick my
1438.0,1440.549,fingers in my eyes. And for some reason
1440.559,1444.149,"when you're here, your instinct is to"
1444.159,1446.87,poke your eyeballs. Going like this
1446.88,1448.71,"through your hands would be fine, but"
1448.72,1450.95,I've been wiping my fingers. Exactly.
1450.96,1453.029,You did the math. And I just did the
1453.039,1455.83,whole thing. And I I need I need a new
