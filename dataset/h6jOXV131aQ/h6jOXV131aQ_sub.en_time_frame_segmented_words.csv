240,245,"that at the time when you were cast in it , you were confident that it would be your"
245,250,"big break in star vehicle to stardom ? Oh god . You know what ? to be honest , every pilot you"
250,255,"think you think is going to be your cuz you do the contracts , you know what you 're"
255,260,"getting each episode . It 's like a guaranteed job every week ,"
260,265,"weekend , week out . Um , but they tease weekend , week out . Um , but they tease you . I mean , I"
265,270,"remember after Friends , the creators of Friends were doing their next show ."
270,275,"It was already picked up for two seasons . It was going to be , they were saying the next"
275,280,"big Friends . I mean , everybody , all my friends that were actors were trying out for it and"
280,285,"everybody really wanted it . Um , and I tested for a role with"
285,290,studio with me and three guys and then I went to network against me and
290,295,another person and then I did n't get it . But then they had me audition for another role
295,300,and I went to studio and then I went to network with me and another person and I did
300,305,n't get it . And I was I ca n't tell you how depressed I was
305,310,for just way too long . Um but if I were to get and it the the show was
310,315,good . I mean it lasted about a season and a half and you know some people liked it
315,320,but it was n't Prince show . It was called The Class . Um and
320,325,then if I were to have done that show I would n't have been available to
325,330,"audition for Breaking Bad . So , you know , the point of the story , you never know what 's"
330,335,"right around the corner , you know . So , just keep keep pounding the"
335,340,pavement . Yeah . This is yours . You 're not

350,355,"bad . It 's pretty good . Sier , what took you so long ? I 'm feeling pretty"
355,360,"confident . You know , it 's probably false confidence because we have , you know , seven"
360,365,more . But it 's all right . I 'm holding on to my false confidence . Do you
365,370,have an all - time favorite or even most perturbing Brian Cranston prank from all of the
370,375,"years that you 've spent sharing a set with him ? Let me tell you . I mean , he 's been on here a"
375,380,"couple times , so you know him . I always say he 's the"
380,385,"hardest worker in the room . The most lovable . I mean , he 's my best"
385,390,"friend , my son 's godfather . I I adore him . I spoke to him for an hour on the phone last"
390,395,"night . I mean , I I really am obsessed with the guy , but he 's also the most immature person I"
395,400,"'ve ever met in my life . And I say that with just love and respect . I mean , the"
400,405,"list was endless . But I remember on Breaking Bad , he came out of the production office ,"
405,410,"came up to me and he goes , "" Come here . It 's okay . "" And he"
410,415,"gives me this long hug . I 'm like , "" What are you doing ? "" He 's like , "" At"
415,420,"least you go out in a big way , huh ? "" And I 'm like , "" What are you talking"
420,425,"about ? "" He goes , "" Did you read the latest script ? "" I go , "" No . "" He goes , "" Oh ,"
425,430,"well , just read it and I 'm here if you need me . "" You know ? I was like , """
430,435,"Okay . "" Okay . So , I sprinted into the "" Okay . "" Okay . So , I sprinted into the production office . I go , "" Wait , Brian read the light"
435,440,"latest script . What happens ? "" You know , I want to read it . And then , of course , I just go to the"
440,445,"final , you know , the final pages and nothing happened . I 'm still around . But"
445,450,"he just made it made it seem like I died . Um , but he would not"
450,455,stop . He would not stop and he would get everybody in on it . like
455,460,"the um uh costume designers said , "" Hey , look , we got to do your measurements for , you"
460,465,"know , the the the casket . "" And uh so if you could stay after after work , um"
465,470,"that would be great . Uh I 'm like , "" What are you talking about ? "" Um but this is all this"
470,475,"is all him . Um but yeah , but I I made it . I"
475,480,made it . It 's doing like a
480,485,little vibrating in my mouth . It definitely has a bit of depth
485,490,that the um other ones did not . It 's sort of a charring quality . You
490,495,"know what ? Yeah , charring is a good"
495,500,Sometimes I 'll hear actors talk about circling days on the production calendar for scenes
500,505,that they 're dreading doing . Right . I 'm wondering when you think about the pages that you looked at
505,510,"that put you into a mental tail spin , does anything immediately come to mind ? Oh"
510,515,"Um , there 's I for some reason I 'm always doing roles that are just"
515,520,getting beat up and tortured . You know what I mean ? I do n't know what that that says about
520,525,"you , right ? I do n't know what that says about me , but um it would"
525,530,have to go back to a Breaking Bad episode . There 's a a scene where
530,535,Jesse wakes up and his his girlfriend Jane is uh
535,540,is dead . And I was terrified to shoot that scene .
540,545,I just I I had this love and complicated relationship . It was such a chemical
545,550,"romance , but he was just so in it , you know , all in . Really felt very in love ,"
550,555,"but did n't realize that she was just destroying him . Um , I mean , they"
555,560,"were destroying themselves together , but I was I was very nervous to"
560,565,"tackle that scene . Um , and I did n't know what to do . I did n't I I did n't really rehearse it , you know . I"
565,570,"just knew I had to put myself in that position as that guy . Um , and so"
570,575,"what you saw is what you saw . Um , it"
575,580,was brutal . Yeah . Should we
580,585,bust out the caviar ? Let me just let me Can I come to your side ?
585,590,"Yeah , you come do Yeah . I like this uh tableside service . You just got to , you"
590,595,"know , let 's just do a dollop . Um , that 's a good , you"
595,600,"know , we 're halfway there . We made it . It 's a touch of class that this show needs ,"
600,605,"Aaron . For real . I 'm here for you . You know , we 're keeping things classy here on"
605,610,"Hot Ones . Um , and you let me know when you want more . You know what I mean ? I will do . Um ,"
610,615,"cheers , buddy . Cheers ."
620,625,"works . It works . You saw it here , folks . It works . So , I"
625,630,understand that there are very few visual effects used for the car stunt
630,635,"scenes in Need for Speed . I 'm wondering , did you have a most harrowing moment behind the wheel shooting an"
635,640,"action sequence for that film ? Oh man , there was this one uh"
640,645,"scene that I was practicing , rehearsing for from day one , and we"
645,650,did n't shoot the scene until midway through um the shoot . And the
650,655,"scene is something very traumatic happens . One of his best friends , his car flips"
655,660,over a bridge and it 's very clear that this guy is either
660,665,instantly dead or he 's in danger . And so I have to flip around in my
665,670,car . He wants to do this in one shot . And the shot is flying
670,675,"towards the camera , doing a skid up to the camera , and then I have"
675,680,"to open up the door and then run to my friend . And Scotty goes , "" Do"
680,685,"n't worry about it . I 'm going to act as the camera operator , and if you hit me ,"
685,690,"does n't matter . "" She 's like , "" Got it . "" Okay . Yeah . So , if I hit you , it does n't"
690,695,"matter . Okay . Um , so , uh , the first take out of the gates , I"
695,700,"come up so short , it 's embarrassing . He goes , "" I 'm being serious . If you hit me , do"
700,705,"n't worry about it . "" Um , and then the second take , I come up , I come"
705,710,this far from the guy . And that 's what you see in the movie . But there 's a lot of lot I nailed
710,715,"it . Um , uh , a lot of pressure there , you"
715,720,Let 's
720,725,"go , baby . This is not bad . I was actually I was"
725,730,"hoping I would start to start sweating by now . I mean , I know I know I 'm I 'm going to get"
730,735,"there , but this is this is very manageable . It 's very manageable . It 's"
735,740,"great . I 'm into it . So , listening to a lot of your old"
740,745,"interviews , a throughine that comes through pretty consistently is your proclivity towards what you describe"
745,750,"as gritty indie drama . Outside of your own films , what are the gritty indie dramas"
750,755,that left the biggest impact on you ? Maybe this is picking up on me . You
