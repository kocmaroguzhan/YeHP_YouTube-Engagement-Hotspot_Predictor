!!!USING GOOGLE CHROME IS SUGGESTED!!!
NOTE: If youtube video is partioned to segments their respective heat map data is loaded seperately so do not use that kind of videos.
To get timestamp vs intensity heatmap open developer console by pressing F12 and in element section search for "heat-map-path" then copy the value after d= ...
To get video duration, in developer console open console section and run 
"document.querySelector('video').duration" command this will give the duration in seconds
