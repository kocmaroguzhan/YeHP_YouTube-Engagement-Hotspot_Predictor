160,180,check it out it is the day where luxury and I mean like big time luxury meets the electric car this is
180,200,the first eqs SUV mybach and this happens to be the night Edition which is even more rare even more expensive in USD over 200k in Canadian almost 300 K but not only are you getting not even arguably
200,220,definitely the most luxurious electric vehicle but you 're also getting these fine little touches that come with this night Edition now I 've looked at a variety of mybox well I 've looked at the gas powered mybox but never the electric version and I 've looked at the eqs but not the myok version
220,240,of that and when you think about it these two worlds colliding kind of makes sense because the electric vehicle is already so quiet to begin with and the Maybach brand is all about refinement and smoothness and comfort and quietness with the
240,260,thick doors and the Dual pain privacy glass now you 've got a match made in heaven do n't
260,280,you this thing has so much to talk about and look at and unlike previous videos where I have a really short period of time to tell you all about it this one one I drove it for a week let 's talk about the exterior and then we 'll move into the inside which is really the important place
280,300,when it comes to luxury like this first these wheels all the tiny little Maybach emblems making up this grid and this eqs series you know some people have said The Styling is a little bit mundane it 's all about drag coefficient
300,320,efficiency electricity whether it 's the eqs sedan or the eqs SUV these things get some serious range this one is no different 450 460 km on a full charge and that 's with a vehicle that 's extremely heavy because you got all these luxury features in there no expense spared you 've got these
320,340,seats with motors and massagers and recline this wheel is doing Dual Purpose as Maybach design but also for added range by stopping some of that air from getting trapped on the inside of the wheel we 've also got a fair amount of rubber here and that 's going to
340,360,Aid in your comfort level and then of course we 've also got mybach labeled there and they have labeled mybach all over the place except for one location surprisingly which is the emblem where they maintain the Mercedes emblem okay now the front has some interesting tidbits here obviously this thing has your
360,380,your smart features your assisted cruise control we have a few different tones going on so you can see many elements blacked out for the night Edition but the two - tone package which always lets you know you 're dealing with the ultimate in luxury from Mercedes however it 's going to cost you in
380,400,Canadian funds this two - tone upgrade is like it 's over 20 grand but it is beautiful and there are elements that are done by hand including this pinstripe here it just feels right on a something else that 's interesting since you have to have front - facing cameras for parking these are extremely useful and in this case in order so that
400,420,they would n't disrupt this bar coming down the front here and the symmetry of this Grill they decided to put the front - facing camera actually slightly off center that decision I can see some people questioning they would say well I want the camera to be dead center they chose a design element to be dead center
420,440,instead I think this is fine this section here carries through a very similar design to the wheels so you 've got this variety of mybach logos some flipped upright and some flipped upside down and then they 've integrated some of your front sensors we 've even got mybok logos
440,460,inside of the headlights like check that out right there there you see the way it gently comes on and that 's another thing this vehicle greets you this vehicle is happy to see you when you arrive you get this little musical chime obviously you 've got the puddle light projectors from the doors more
460,480,mybach emblems of course projected onto mybach emblems of course projected onto the ground you can tweak all of this atmospheric stuff on the outside inside of the car but by default it 's just like this it 's singing you a little song it 's letting you know that it 's glad that you 've spent all this money it 's a reminder that you 're not
480,500,stepping into a typical vehicle but instead you 're stepping into a myok and an electric Mercedes this is a really interesting location at first you might be thinking that is a very narrow charge port well it 's not a charge port at all in fact this might be the world
500,520,'s most convenient refill station for your washer fluid and by the way I was trying to pop it open when the car was locked and it was n't allowing me to do so so nobody can mess with your washer fluid pour something else in there I mean I did n't even think about that until I just tried to open it while the car was locked now one of the reasons
520,540,for that is because underneath This Hood there is no frunk this is a frontless EV and you might be like wait a sec there should be plenty of room under there according to Mercedes there 's all kinds of important components that are housed under there and therefore you get no frunk and you 'll be refilling your washer fluid on the side of the vehicle over here these doors
540,560,are motorized self - closing when you get into the driver 's seat if you put your foot on the brake pedal the door will close on its own you can also program the unlock button if you press and hold you can have it open in this case the passenger door like magic look at this go ahead step right up no problem and to
560,580,close the door a little touch on the outside and more magic another mybok logo down here I think this is kind of funny this little step because the car is not that high to begin with another Maybach emblem here this is maybe my favorite one of the bunch I do n't know why that is I just feel like that is the perfect spot for an emblem I just like this emblem
580,600,also on this side we have our charge port and it 's underneath this cap here this looks pretty simple of course we have our flip down for faster charging I can notice some gaskets there as well to keep water from getting in around back I mean it 's simple looking kind of from every angle but what they 've added is detail one of
600,620,those things is the way that you open the trunk so a lot of SUVs you have some sort of button down at the bottom where it lifts up and you kind of search for it and it gets dirty down there this one you 're not going to miss because it 's this giant Mercedes emblem in the center and it does dual function because it also flips up for your rear - facing camera parking
620,640,camera just push like that and it opens up the trunk and of course the whole time you 're getting that nice little Ambience of the tail light there buzzing back and forth as you do these activities the other thing you notice when you open this up is this detail here you have really what is an upside down mybach
640,660,emblem but then it 's right side up when you open up the trunk this is all leather wrapped leather stitched sections pretty much everywhere we have a charge cable in the back it 's tethered so it does n't jump around too much and we 've also got a little compartment I did n't even open this up yet but a
660,680,little compartment for some extras looks like an air compressor for the Tire in there and one thing I do like as well you have these metal protectors for bigger pieces of luggage and things this is the first for me I have n't seen the luggage cover with built - in speakers before so they figured out a way to just give it a little added depth burm if
680,700,you have n't had exposure it 's sort of that topend as far as car audio like from the factory this is typically an upgrade from other brands oh also this unit can be configured with the refrigerator for some reason this particular model that we 're looking at
700,720,does n't have that option but if you did does n't have that option but if you did have the option for the fridge it would be sitting sort of right here it is nice to know that it is removable like so you can take the fridge in and out if you need more cargo but that 's where it would go if you do n't have the fridge configured this acts as a pass through for longer items I put a few hockey
720,740,sticks through there closed oh I should also mention while we 're on the outside you have a big panoramic glass this does open and it looks like you 've also got a spot for a roof rack Mercedes let 's let 's do a project off - road mybach another burm Master speaker here
740,760,and one up top here they 're they are all over the place the sound system and the sound experience I had my 4 - year - old daughter in here and that was her number one favorite feature I said before I said you 're not going to ride in this car anymore Mercedes is taking this car back but I do want to know what your favorite thing about it was and she said listening to the
760,780,trolls soundtrack anyway over here is where you 're going to control and configure your comfort for your seat here you have seat heating you have seat cooling as far as seat configuration goes my favorite section is here this little button on the top controls seat depth this is this is my thigh okay it 's kind
780,800,of a longer it 's a longer thigh so a lot of a longer it 's a longer thigh so a lot of seats end up feeling kind of short and I 'll sit in it this is with it in its default position you can see there 's a gap from the end of the seat to where my leg actually ends so if I have this up here that 's half a thigh half half an
800,820,unsupported thigh so if I grab this guy and move this out check out what happens the seat depth and it 's from the back so my butt is actually see I can it 's a it 's extending here see the seat pan is moving out further so my butt can sink back further even though this section stays roughly the same length and then look what happens I get this
820,840,nice support the whole way that 's my favorite car seat feature that I 've uh experienced the key with this vehicle is just how quiet and peaceful it is the world melts away your stress melts away it truly has an effect on you
840,860,when you think about these refinements and you think why would you go through this painstaking process of trying to cut the sound of the road or external sound so much well obviously because you want to charge people for it eventually but also because you are trying to deliver the most
860,880,refined Driving Experience and I think they may have done it in this
880,900,okay so we 're inside now that 's what it 's all about with the mybach the inside bringing the mybok portion to the eqs means that you 're getting the most updated and highest Tech interior that
900,920,Mercedes is really offering you 're getting this massive display across the front well it 's actually three different displays but they make it seam like one through this seamless piece of glass that just carries across the whole thing it 's it 's a really refined approach compared to other Interiors where you have oh Mercedes
920,940,heard me say mer cancel thanks likewise the other thing you 're going to notice is the ambient lighting but essentially you 've got this light strip it goes all the way around the vehicle and it 's capable of responding to situations so like if you 're going to exit your lane or something it goes red so if we hit the ambient light button yes it can do
940,960,monochrome really any color as you can see it carries to the dash as well so that 's all right you can do monochrome obviously have brightness settings you can do different zones you can link the zones but multicolor is the coolest some other cool options are gradients that move between different colors from Blue to teal or from purple
960,980,yellow cyan to magenta the fact that it also moves through other Dash elements and displays creates some amazing Ambience at night I do n't think any other company competes in that space as far as customizable Ambience because there 's so many
980,1000,different minor lighting elements and Screen elements that are all contributing to that Ambience like down in the footwell or around the vents which by the way are really satisfying they kind of look like something out of a retro fighter
1000,1020,plane but they 're manual they 're not inside of a screen they 're quick to adjust and they 're smooth and this tiny little RGB ring lights up the pattern and just contributes to that ambient so there is another way to control the doors which is via this display show you which doors
1020,1040,are open or closed and it 'll let you open or close any of the four doors from this location you can see my door opens up and I can exit now obviously you 've also got Wireless Android auto Apple carplay options that are in here now we 're going to talk a little bit more about this variety of features when we 're actually driving before we get out on the road
1040,1060,I just want to finish up talking about the interior and most importantly the back seat so this center console here we get more of this kind of open pour wood you can see the way it 's laid in there and just this really nice texture to it this portion slides open and you have a wireless charger up front which you can see is lit and it has a nonslip pad in
1060,1080,there you also have two USBC ports and they do Quick Charge we 've got another set of controls here we can control our Drive modes and it 's currently in the mybox setting which they suggest is to do mostly with your suspension you 're having mybox suspension which is just like a way to think about that is just the smoothest ride you
1080,1100,'ve ever experienced my bock is the default is what I 've been in almost the entire time however there is a sport mode and it will get more responsive this thing is about 0 to 60 in 4.4 seconds I believe which is impressive for a vehicle of this scale and weight so extremely
1100,1120,useful camera system for parking assistance I can look at every angle around the car rendered inside the studio the other thing we have here is some storage and actually what 's inside the storage right now is number 12 mood interior perfume this
1120,1140,car has a scent aspect to it when it 's setting the mood with the ambient and the variety of different sound profiles you can set up but you can have a scent to go along with it this installs in the glove box we 've also got headphones wireless headphones you can see we have a nice bag to hold it in look at these look
1140,1160,at those units right there I mean those are cool enough on their own Mercedes branded noise cancelling headphones two pairs now this steering wheel is like this glossy finish with leather wrap on the inside a very luxurious feel uh if you 're familiar with Mercedes like this is a thing s - classes it just
1160,1180,you know you 're driving something different when you have this dual setup on the wheel with the gloss and the leather on the inside of course you 've got plenty of adjustment for the wheel as well as far as the seats are concerned like I mean you got this beautiful quilted finish to it all very high quality very adjustable and then obviously a variety of different massage settings as
1180,1200,well which maybe I 'll turn those on when we actually get out and get driving now nighttime is when you
1200,1220,want to be in this car it is like cyberpunk it is like futuristic it is unexpected my initial eqs video This is the part that blew me away the most and it gets a reaction every single time the ambient Lighting in here is so considerate all this variety of bright linear
1220,1240,and diffusion like subtle diffusion you hear that gentle hum that peaceful sound that Ambience this diffused sound just kind of there and this gradient that flows through
1240,1260,your dash see if I change the mood it will affect the displays and the ambience Miami Rose burning Blue Malibu sunset Ocean Blue jungle Green Garnet glow rose gold white
1260,1280,amethyst glow all right so the back seat of the mybach is where you want to be if you can because this is the most comfortable spot I mean it 's better than a limo like it 's you have access to all your
1280,1300,entertainment you have the ability to recline you 've got this pillow where your head is then you have these optional lumbar pillows with mybach branding on them I 've actually got it out right now cuz it lets me get a little bit further back I am exactly 6 ft tall and I can get my feet up on this
1300,1320,foot rest like check out this positioning here comes the foot rest as well to support the bottom part of my legs and this has a pillow on it also and that just takes the weight off of my heels over there so if I push my feet to the side I can be comfortable no problem it also will move the
1320,1340,front seat forward and then put the screen into the right orientation for me to see it like at the right angle now you might be saying how are you going to reach that screen to interact with it though well you do n't have to because you have this tablet right here and I can either use the tablet in that location or I can use this
1340,1360,little extraction motor to lift it up and then use it like this and so from here I can control all types of aspects of the car there 's a few different ways you can interface as far as the media is concerned you have Bluetooth online music USB media files and two HDMI ports so you just
1360,1380,open this up like this and this is actually pretty cool because you also get this wireless charger with an anti - slip mat tons of USB ports fast charge capable there 's four of them here and they 're illuminated with blue LEDs you also have a DC if you need a little bit more power and and then these
1380,1400,are mini hdmis so that 's important to note you would need an adapter listen it 's something you 're going to get once and then you 'll be done with it you 'll just have a nice little adapter in there for whichever device you want to connect you could even get crazy and try to run like a game console with an external battery and an HDMI and play some PlayStation
1400,1420,on this display if you want to now that 's not the only compartment when you 're back here by the way that 's just one of two this is a motorized compartment tons of that open port wood in this location we click this button and this motor goes into action opening this section here we have two cup holders hot and
1420,1440,cold you have room for a smaller bottle and then a larger one and you can feel it start to get cold right away if I click it again I move into hot mode and what I love here is it 's so obvious which mode you 're in pillows for the lumbar which I have down there pillows for your head another funny thing about these seats they do have
1440,1460,isofix under here it 's kind of just a funny thought of like a kid being in this rear seat being chauffered around a lot of glass which makes it feel more open and large and then you 'll probably also see the RGB continues all through here and it just creates like so many different diffused lighting zones another thing you 'll notice
1460,1480,here illuminated seat belt buckle a simple little thing at night you 're looking for this well now you 're not really looking Oh My My Little pillow came loose there 's the cooling ooh lovely very like powerful cooling by the way like my butt is cold immediately just getting getting work done
1480,1500,you know reading my docu reading magazines if I had a car like this I 'd just be back here reading magazines National Geographic Mo does n't even know what a magazine is the back is better than the front I mean this is this is wild back here this is so comfy it 's a mybok like yeah of
1500,1520,course that 's what you paid for I had a cousin once that visited when I was in high school from and his favorite thing like if he did n't understand something we were talking
1520,1540,about sure what is oh just told me to put my hands on the wheel right there I was looking away too much I thought but look at can I say I mean this is about Comfort it 's about relaxation it 's about refinement it 's as if you gave somebody a mission a team you
1540,1560,gave them a mission you said make the most comfortable sophisticated person vehicle that you possibly can and they thought of everything they thought of everything you might might want
1560,1580,to have in something like that certainly when you step into this when you drive it you get a sense for that level of refinement and the amount of work that would would have gone into executing that the idea seems simple maybe outside of
1580,1600,the electrification the idea what do you have to have tighter gaps and thicker glass and and more comfortable seats with more adjustments and reclines and the but it 's the execution that 's really where the rubber meets the road for a
1600,1620,vehicle like that 's really what matters is the execution you got to go in there with a fine tooth comb and a bunch of people got to check on that manufacturing process and there 's so many different people involved in the production of a car like this to ensure that it meets
1620,1640,that quality standard and that 's really what sets these Ultra Luxury Vehicles apart it 's what sets that mybach branding apart from the standard Mercedes brand which is already obviously luxurious but will has the best seat the guy who matters most is in your seat
1640,1660,will like if you 're in Germany right and you 're on your way to an important meeting this car picks you up and you sit there you 're wearing a suit you are are stressed that 's it just a 10minute Serene Breeze reprieve this
1660,1680,suspension is ridiculous it 's a hovercraft here 's like I 'm going to venture off the road a little bit you did n't feel it that was dirt that 's a dirt you did n't feel it guy behind me thinks I 'm nuts he thinks the guy in the uh mybach has lost it he he might not be wrong he might not be wrong or maybe
1680,1700,I gained it maybe I did n't lose it maybe I gained
1700,1720,it cheese only time can provide yeah like a place like this yeah without the time it 's not what it is it needs the time you what I
