160,165,check it
165,170,out it is the day where
170,175,luxury and I mean like big time
175,180,luxury meets the electric car this is
180,185,the first eqs SUV mybach and this happens
185,190,to be the night Edition which is even more rare even more
190,195,expensive in USD over 200k in Canadian
195,200,almost 300 K but not only are you getting not even arguably
200,205,definitely the most luxurious electric vehicle but you 're also getting
205,210,these fine little touches that come with this night Edition now I 've looked
210,215,at a variety of mybox well I 've looked at the gas powered mybox but never the
215,220,electric version and I 've looked at the eqs but not the myok version
220,225,of that and when you think about it these two worlds colliding kind of makes
225,230,sense because the electric vehicle is already so quiet to
230,235,begin with and the Maybach brand is all about refinement and
235,240,smoothness and comfort and quietness with the
240,245,thick doors and the Dual pain privacy glass now you
245,250,'ve got a match made in heaven do n't
260,265,you this thing has so much to talk about and look at and unlike
265,270,previous videos where I have a really short period of time to tell you all about it this one
270,275,one I drove it for a week let 's talk about the exterior and then we 'll
275,280,move into the inside which is really the important place
280,285,when it comes to luxury like this first these
285,290,wheels all the tiny little Maybach emblems making up
290,295,this grid and this eqs series you know some people have said The
295,300,Styling is a little bit mundane it 's all about drag coefficient
300,305,efficiency electricity whether it 's the eqs sedan or the eqs SUV these
305,310,things get some serious range this one is no different 450 460 km
310,315,on a full charge and that 's with a vehicle that 's extremely heavy because
315,320,you got all these luxury features in there no expense spared you 've got these
320,325,seats with motors and massagers and recline this wheel is doing
325,330,Dual Purpose as Maybach design but also for
330,335,added range by stopping some of that air from getting trapped on the
335,340,inside of the wheel we 've also got a fair amount of rubber here and that 's going to
340,345,Aid in your comfort level and then of course we 've also got mybach labeled there
345,350,and they have labeled mybach all over the place except for one location
350,355,surprisingly which is the emblem where they maintain the Mercedes emblem okay now the
355,360,front has some interesting tidbits here obviously this thing has your
360,365,your smart features your assisted cruise control we have a few different
365,370,tones going on so you can see many elements blacked out for the night
370,375,Edition but the two - tone package which always lets you know you 're dealing
375,380,with the ultimate in luxury from Mercedes however it 's going to cost you in
380,385,Canadian funds this two - tone upgrade is like it 's over 20 grand but it is beautiful and there are
385,390,elements that are done by hand including this pinstripe here it just feels right on a
390,395,something else that 's interesting since you have to have front - facing
395,400,cameras for parking these are extremely useful and in this case in order so that
400,405,they would n't disrupt this bar coming down the front here and the symmetry
405,410,of this Grill they decided to put the front - facing camera actually slightly
410,415,off center that decision I can see some people questioning they would say well I
415,420,want the camera to be dead center they chose a design element to be dead center
420,425,instead I think this is fine this section here carries through a very
425,430,similar design to the wheels so you 've got this variety
430,435,of mybach logos some flipped upright and some flipped upside down and then
435,440,they 've integrated some of your front sensors we 've even got mybok logos
440,445,inside of the headlights like check that out right there there you see the way it gently
445,450,comes on and that 's another thing this vehicle greets you this
450,455,vehicle is happy to see you when you arrive you get this little musical
455,460,chime obviously you 've got the puddle light projectors from the doors more
460,465,mybach emblems of course projected onto mybach emblems of course projected onto the ground you can
465,470,tweak all of this atmospheric stuff on the outside inside of the car but by
470,475,default it 's just like this it 's singing you a little song it 's letting you
475,480,know that it 's glad that you 've spent all this money it 's a reminder that you 're not
480,485,stepping into a typical vehicle but instead you 're stepping
485,490,into a myok and an electric
490,495,Mercedes this is a really interesting location at first you might be thinking that is a very
495,500,narrow charge port well it 's not a charge port at all in fact this might be the world
500,505,'s most convenient refill station for your washer
505,510,fluid and by the way I was trying to pop it open when the car was locked and it was n't
510,515,allowing me to do so so nobody can mess with your washer fluid pour something else in
515,520,there I mean I did n't even think about that until I just tried to open it while the car was locked now one of the reasons
520,525,for that is because underneath This Hood there is no frunk this is a frontless EV and you might
525,530,be like wait a sec there should be plenty of room under there according to Mercedes there 's all
530,535,kinds of important components that are housed under there and therefore you get no frunk and you 'll be
535,540,refilling your washer fluid on the side of the vehicle over here these doors
540,545,are motorized self - closing when you get into the driver 's seat if you put your foot on the
545,550,brake pedal the door will close on its own you can also program the unlock button if you press and
550,555,hold you can have it open in this case the passenger door like magic
555,560,look at this go ahead step right up no problem and to
560,565,close the door a little touch on the outside and more magic
565,570,another mybok logo down here I think this is kind of funny this little step because the car
570,575,is not that high to begin with another Maybach emblem here this is maybe my favorite one of the bunch I
575,580,do n't know why that is I just feel like that is the perfect spot for an emblem I just like this emblem
580,585,also on this side we have our charge port and it 's underneath this cap here this looks
585,590,pretty simple of course we have our flip down for faster charging I can notice some
590,595,gaskets there as well to keep water from getting in around back I mean it 's simple
595,600,looking kind of from every angle but what they 've added is detail one of
600,605,those things is the way that you open the trunk so a lot of SUVs you have some sort of button down at
605,610,the bottom where it lifts up and you kind of search for it and it gets dirty down there this one you 're not going to miss
610,615,because it 's this giant Mercedes emblem in the center and it does dual function
615,620,because it also flips up for your rear - facing camera parking
620,625,camera just push like that and it opens up the trunk and of course the whole time you
625,630,'re getting that nice little Ambience of the tail light there
630,635,buzzing back and forth as you do these activities the other thing you notice when you open this up is
635,640,this detail here you have really what is an upside down mybach
640,645,emblem but then it 's right side up when you open up the trunk
645,650,this is all leather wrapped leather stitched sections
650,655,pretty much everywhere we have a charge cable in the back it 's tethered so it does n't
655,660,jump around too much and we 've also got a little compartment I did n't even open this up yet but a
660,665,little compartment for some extras looks like an air compressor for the Tire in there and one thing I do
665,670,like as well you have these metal protectors for bigger pieces of luggage
670,675,and things this is the first for me I have n't seen the luggage cover with
675,680,built - in speakers before so they figured out a way to just give it a little added depth burm if
680,685,you have n't had exposure it 's sort of that topend as far as
685,690,car audio like from the factory this is typically an upgrade from
690,695,other brands oh also this unit can be configured
695,700,with the refrigerator for some reason this particular model that we 're looking at
700,705,does n't have that option but if you did does n't have that option but if you did have the option for the fridge it would be
705,710,sitting sort of right here it is nice to know that it is removable like so you can take the fridge in
710,715,and out if you need more cargo but that 's where it would go if you do n't have the fridge
715,720,configured this acts as a pass through for longer items I put a few hockey
720,725,sticks through there closed oh I should also mention while
725,730,we 're on the outside you have a big panoramic glass this does open and
730,735,it looks like you 've also got a spot for a roof rack Mercedes let 's let 's do a
735,740,project off - road mybach another burm project off - road mybach another burm Master speaker here
740,745,and one up top here they 're they are all over the place the sound system and the
745,750,sound experience I had my 4 - year - old daughter in here and that was her number one favorite
750,755,feature I said before I said you 're not going to ride in this car anymore Mercedes is taking this
755,760,car back but I do want to know what your favorite thing about it was and she said listening to the
760,765,trolls soundtrack anyway over here is where you 're going to control and configure
765,770,your comfort for your seat here you have your comfort for your seat here you have seat heating you have seat cooling
770,775,as far as seat configuration goes my favorite section is here this little
775,780,button on the top controls seat depth this is this is my thigh okay it 's kind
780,785,of a longer it 's a longer thigh so a lot of a longer it 's a longer thigh so a lot of seats end up
785,790,feeling kind of short and I 'll sit in it this is with it in its default
790,795,position you can see there 's a gap from the end of the seat to where my leg actually
795,800,ends so if I have this up here that 's half a thigh half half an
800,805,unsupported thigh so if I grab this guy and move this out check out what happens the seat depth
805,810,and it 's from the back so my butt is actually see I can it 's a it 's
810,815,extending here see the seat pan is moving out further so my butt can sink back
815,820,further even though this section stays roughly the same length and then look what happens I get this
820,825,nice support the whole way that 's my favorite car seat feature
825,830,that I 've uh experienced the key with this vehicle is
830,835,just how quiet and peaceful it is the world melts
835,840,away your stress melts away it truly has an effect on you
840,845,when you think about these refinements and you think why would you go through this
845,850,painstaking process of trying to cut the sound of the road
850,855,or external sound so much well obviously because you want to charge
855,860,people for it eventually but also because you are trying to deliver the most
860,865,refined Driving Experience and I think they may have done it in this
885,890,okay so we 're inside now that 's what it 's all about with the mybach
890,895,the inside bringing the mybok portion to the eqs means that
895,900,you 're getting the most updated and highest Tech interior that
900,905,Mercedes is really offering you 're getting this massive display across the front well it 's
905,910,actually three different displays but they make it seam like one through
910,915,this seamless piece of glass that just carries across the whole thing it 's it 's a really
915,920,refined approach compared to other Interiors where you have oh Mercedes
920,925,heard me say mer cancel thanks likewise the other thing you 're going to notice is the
925,930,ambient lighting but essentially you 've got this light strip it goes all the way around the
930,935,vehicle and it 's capable of responding to situations so like if you 're going to exit
935,940,your lane or something it goes red so if we hit the ambient light button yes it can do
940,945,monochrome really any color as you can see it carries to the dash as well so that 's
945,950,all right you can do monochrome obviously have brightness settings you can do different zones you can link the zones
950,955,but multicolor is the coolest some other cool options are gradients that move
955,960,between different colors from Blue to teal or from purple
960,965,yellow cyan to magenta the fact that it also moves through other
965,970,Dash elements and displays creates some amazing Ambience at
970,975,night I do n't think any other company competes in that
975,980,space as far as customizable Ambience because there 's so many
980,985,different minor lighting elements and Screen elements that are all
985,990,contributing to that Ambience like down in the footwell or around
990,995,the vents which by the way are really
995,1000,satisfying they kind of look like something out of a retro fighter
1000,1005,plane but they 're manual they 're not inside of a screen they 're quick to
1005,1010,adjust and they 're smooth and this tiny little RGB ring
1010,1015,lights up the pattern and just contributes to that ambient
1015,1020,so there is another way to control the doors which is via this display show you which doors
1020,1025,are open or closed and it 'll let you open or close any of the four doors
1025,1030,from this location you can see my door opens up and I can exit now obviously
1030,1035,you 've also got Wireless Android auto Apple carplay options that are in here now we 're
1035,1040,going to talk a little bit more about this variety of features when we 're actually driving before we get out on the road
1040,1045,I just want to finish up talking about the interior and most importantly the back seat so this center console here
1045,1050,we get more of this kind of open pour wood you can see the way it 's laid in there and
1050,1055,just this really nice texture to it this portion slides open and you
1055,1060,have a wireless charger up front which you can see is lit and it has a nonslip pad in
1060,1065,there you also have two USBC ports and they do Quick Charge we 've got another set of controls
1065,1070,here we can control our Drive modes and it 's currently in the mybox
1070,1075,setting which they suggest is to do mostly with your suspension you 're having
1075,1080,mybox suspension which is just like a way to think about that is just the smoothest ride you
1080,1085,'ve ever experienced my bock is the default is what I 've been in almost the entire time
1085,1090,however there is a sport mode and it will get more responsive this thing is
1090,1095,about 0 to 60 in 4.4 seconds I believe which is impressive for a
1095,1100,vehicle of this scale and weight so extremely
1100,1105,useful camera system for parking assistance I can look at
1105,1110,every angle around the car rendered inside the studio the other thing we have
1110,1115,here is some storage and actually what 's inside the storage right
1115,1120,now is number 12 mood interior perfume this
1120,1125,car has a scent aspect to it when it 's setting the mood with the ambient and
1125,1130,the variety of different sound profiles you can set up but you can have a scent to go along
1130,1135,with it this installs in the glove box we 've also got headphones wireless headphones
1135,1140,you can see we have a nice bag to hold it in look at these look
1140,1145,at those units right there I mean those are cool enough on their own Mercedes branded noise
1145,1150,cancelling headphones two pairs now this steering wheel is like this
1150,1155,glossy finish with leather wrap on the inside a very luxurious
1155,1160,feel uh if you 're familiar with Mercedes like this is a thing s - classes it just
1160,1165,you know you 're driving something different when you have this dual setup on the wheel with the gloss and the
1165,1170,leather on the inside of course you 've got plenty of adjustment for the wheel as well as far as the seats are
1170,1175,concerned like I mean you got this beautiful quilted finish to it all very high quality very
1175,1180,adjustable and then obviously a variety of different massage settings as
1180,1185,well which maybe I 'll turn those on when we actually get out and get
1195,1200,driving now nighttime is when you
1200,1205,want to be in this car it is like cyberpunk it is like futuristic it
1205,1210,is unexpected my initial eqs video This is the part that blew me away the
1210,1215,most and it gets a reaction every single time the ambient Lighting in here is so
1215,1220,considerate all this variety of bright linear
1220,1225,and diffusion like subtle diffusion you
1225,1230,hear that gentle hum that peaceful
1230,1235,sound that Ambience this diffused sound just kind
1235,1240,of there and this gradient that flows through
1240,1245,your dash see if I change the mood it will affect
1245,1250,the displays and the ambience Miami Rose
1250,1255,burning Blue Malibu sunset Ocean Blue jungle
1255,1260,Green Garnet glow rose gold white
1260,1265,amethyst
1265,1270,glow all right so the back seat of the mybach is
1270,1275,where you want to be if you can because this is the most
1275,1280,comfortable spot I mean it 's better than a limo like it 's you have access to all your
1280,1285,entertainment you have the ability to recline you 've got this pillow where your head is
1285,1290,then you have these optional lumbar pillows with
1290,1295,mybach branding on them I 've actually got it out right now cuz it lets me get a little bit further
1295,1300,back I am exactly 6 ft tall and I can get my feet up on this
1300,1305,foot rest like check out this positioning here comes the foot rest
1305,1310,as well to support the bottom part of my legs and this has a pillow on
1310,1315,it also and that just takes the weight off of my heels over there so if I push my
1315,1320,feet to the side I can be comfortable no problem it also will move the
1320,1325,front seat forward and then put the screen into the right orientation
1325,1330,for me to see it like at the right angle now you might be saying how are you going to
1330,1335,reach that screen to interact with it though well you do n't have to because you have this tablet
1335,1340,right here and I can either use the right here and I can either use the tablet in that location or I can use this
1340,1345,little extraction motor to lift it up and then use it like this
1345,1350,and so from here I can control all types of aspects of the car there 's a few
1350,1355,different ways you can interface as far as the media is concerned you have Bluetooth online
1355,1360,music USB media files and two HDMI ports so you just
1360,1365,open this up like this and this is actually pretty cool because you also get this
1365,1370,wireless charger with an anti - slip mat tons of USB ports fast charge
1370,1375,capable there 's four of them here and they 're illuminated with blue LEDs you
1375,1380,also have a DC if you need a little bit more power and and then these
1380,1385,are mini hdmis so that 's important to note you would need an adapter listen it 's something you 're
1385,1390,going to get once and then you 'll be done with it you 'll just have a nice little adapter in there
1390,1395,for whichever device you want to connect you could even get crazy and try to run like a game
1395,1400,console with an external battery and an HDMI and play some PlayStation
1400,1405,on this display if you want to now that 's not the only compartment when you 're back here by the way that 's just one
1405,1410,of two this is a motorized compartment tons of that open port wood in this
1410,1415,location we click this button and this motor goes into action
1415,1420,opening this section here we have two cup holders hot and
1420,1425,cold you have room for a smaller bottle and then a larger one and you can feel it start
1425,1430,to get cold right away if I click it again I move into hot mode and what I love here is it
1430,1435,'s so obvious which mode you 're in pillows for the lumbar which I have down
1435,1440,there pillows for your head another funny thing about these seats they do have
1440,1445,isofix under here it 's kind of just a funny thought of like a kid being in this rear
1445,1450,seat being chauffered around a lot of glass which makes it feel more open and
1450,1455,large and then you 'll probably also see the RGB continues all through here and it
1455,1460,just creates like so many different diffused lighting zones another thing you 'll notice
1460,1465,here illuminated seat belt buckle a simple little thing at night you 're
1465,1470,looking for this well now you 're not really looking Oh My My Little pillow came loose
1470,1475,there 's the cooling ooh lovely very like powerful cooling by the
1475,1480,way like my butt is cold immediately just getting getting work done
1480,1485,you know reading my docu reading magazines if I had a car like this I 'd just be back here
1485,1490,reading magazines National Geographic Mo does n't even know what a magazine is the back is better
1490,1495,than the front I mean this is this is wild back here this is so comfy it 's a mybok
1495,1500,like yeah of
1500,1505,course that 's what you paid for
1505,1510,I had a cousin
1510,1515,once that visited when I was in high school from
1515,1520,and his favorite thing like if he did n't understand something we were talking
1520,1525,about sure what is oh just told me to put my hands on the
1525,1530,wheel right there I was looking away too much I thought but look at can I say I mean this is
1530,1535,about Comfort it 's about relaxation it 's about
1535,1540,refinement it 's as if you gave somebody a mission a team you
1540,1545,gave them a mission you said make the most
1545,1550,comfortable sophisticated person
1550,1555,vehicle that you possibly can
1555,1560,and they thought of everything they thought of everything you might might want
1560,1565,to have in something like that certainly when you step into this
1565,1570,when you drive it you get a sense for that level of refinement and
1570,1575,the amount of work that would would have gone into executing
1575,1580,that the idea seems simple maybe outside of
1580,1585,the electrification the idea what do you have to have
1585,1590,tighter gaps and thicker glass and and more comfortable
