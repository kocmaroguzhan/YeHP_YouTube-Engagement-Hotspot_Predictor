100.88,103.149,side but importantly here we've got
103.159,105.069,reinforcement where your heels are going
105.079,108.149,to sit and this is a rubberized portion

136.519,138.589,mats this one does a better job of
138.599,140.07,convincing you that you're actually
140.08,141.71,looking at something that's more like
141.72,144.03,carpeting than something that's
144.04,146.11,rubberized so you don't have to
146.12,148.75,sacrifice the look while getting the
148.76,151.03,durability of in all weather matap
151.04,153.07,thanks again to tuxmat for sponsoring
153.08,154.71,this episode and if you guys are
154.72,155.949,interested and want to check if they
155.959,158.03,make tuxmat for your vehicle click the
158.04,160.26,link in the description and go check it
166.64,171.47,out it is the day where luxury and I
171.48,176.11,mean like big time luxury
176.12,180.71,meets the electric car this is the first
180.72,185.39,eqs SUV mybach and this happens to be
185.4,188.11,the night Edition which is even more
188.12,191.83,rare even more expensive in USD over
191.84,196.229,200k in Canadian almost 300K
196.239,198.869,but not only are you getting not even
198.879,201.75,arguably definitely the most luxurious
201.76,204.71,electric vehicle but you're also getting
204.72,207.149,these fine little touches that come with
207.159,210.27,this night Edition now I've looked at a
210.28,212.149,variety of mybox well I've looked at the
212.159,215.47,gas powered mybox but never the electric
215.48,218.11,version and I've looked at the eqs but
218.12,221.11,not the myok version of that and when
221.12,223.309,you think about it these two worlds
223.319,225.509,colliding kind of makes sense because
225.519,229.71,the electric vehicle is already so quiet
229.72,232.149,to begin with and the Maybach brand is
232.159,233.55,all about
233.56,237.19,refinement and smoothness and comfort
237.2,241.429,and quietness with the thick doors and
241.439,245.149,the Dual pain privacy glass now you've
245.159,248.32,got a match made in heaven don't
259.959,263.27,you this thing has so much to talk about
263.28,265.79,and look at and unlike previous videos
265.8,267.469,where I have a really short period of
267.479,269.749,time to tell you all about it this one
269.759,272.909,one I drove it for a week let's talk
272.919,275.27,about the exterior and then we'll move
275.28,277.909,into the inside which is really the
277.919,282.23,important place when it comes to luxury
282.24,285.79,like this first these wheels all the
285.8,289.749,tiny little Maybach emblems making up
289.759,292.43,this grid and this eqs series you know
292.44,295.51,some people have said The Styling is a
295.52,298.15,little bit mundane it's all about drag
298.16,300.189,coefficient efficiency
300.199,302.99,electricity whether it's the eqs sedan
303.0,306.43,or the eqs SUV these things get some
306.44,308.87,serious range this one is no different
308.88,312.95,450 460 km on a full charge and that's
312.96,314.629,with a vehicle that's extremely heavy
314.639,316.029,because you got all these luxury
316.039,318.79,features in there no expense spared
318.8,321.029,you've got these seats with motors and
321.039,324.35,massagers and recline this wheel is
324.36,328.35,doing Dual Purpose as Maybach design but
328.36,330.71,also for added range
330.72,332.79,by stopping some of that air from
332.8,335.629,getting trapped on the inside of the
335.639,337.67,wheel we've also got a fair amount of
337.68,340.39,rubber here and that's going to Aid in
340.4,342.39,your comfort level and then of course
342.4,345.15,we've also got mybach labeled there and
345.16,347.11,they have labeled mybach all over the
347.12,349.23,place except for one location
349.24,351.35,surprisingly which is the emblem where
351.36,354.15,they maintain the Mercedes emblem okay
354.16,356.51,now the front has some interesting
356.52,359.39,tidbits here obviously this thing has
359.4,362.67,your your smart features your assisted
362.68,364.909,cruise control we have a few different
364.919,368.309,tones going on so you can see many
368.319,369.87,elements blacked out for the night
369.88,372.469,Edition but the two-tone package which
372.479,375.029,always lets you know you're dealing with
375.039,377.55,the ultimate in luxury from Mercedes
377.56,379.589,however it's going to cost you in
379.599,382.11,Canadian funds this two-tone upgrade is
382.12,383.909,like it's over 20 grand but it is
383.919,385.27,beautiful and there are elements that
385.28,386.67,are done by hand including this
386.68,389.23,pinstripe here it just feels right on a
390.08,391.71,something else that's interesting since
391.72,395.27,you have to have front-facing cameras
395.28,398.07,for parking these are extremely useful
398.08,400.23,and in this case in order so that they
400.24,403.029,wouldn't disrupt this bar coming down
403.039,405.39,the front here and the symmetry of this
405.4,407.87,Grill they decided to put the
407.88,409.87,front-facing camera actually slightly
409.88,413.11,off center that decision I can see some
413.12,414.95,people questioning they would say well I
414.96,417.39,want the camera to be dead center they
417.4,419.83,chose a design element to be dead center
419.84,422.39,instead I think this is fine this
422.4,424.749,section here carries through a very
424.759,428.23,similar design to the wheels so you've
428.24,432.11,got this variety of mybach logos some
432.12,434.43,flipped upright and some flipped upside
434.44,436.11,down and then they've integrated some of
436.12,439.589,your front sensors we've even got mybok
439.599,441.99,logos inside of the headlights like
442.0,443.95,check that out right there there you see
443.96,446.11,the way it gently comes on and that's
446.12,449.07,another thing this vehicle greets you
449.08,452.27,this vehicle is happy to see you when
452.28,454.869,you arrive you get this little musical
454.879,457.51,chime obviously you've got the puddle
457.52,459.99,light projectors from the doors more
460.0,463.07,mybach emblems of course projected onto
463.08,466.43,the ground you can tweak all of this
466.44,468.43,atmospheric stuff on the outside inside
468.44,471.07,of the car but by default it's just like
471.08,474.07,this it's singing you a little song it's
474.08,476.589,letting you know that it's glad that
476.599,478.43,you've spent all this money it's a
478.44,480.79,reminder that you're not stepping into a
480.8,482.189,typical vehicle but instead you're
482.199,490.11,stepping into a myok and an electric
490.12,492.589,Mercedes this is a really interesting
492.599,494.309,location at first you might be thinking
494.319,496.149,that is a very narrow charge port well
496.159,498.749,it's not a charge port at all in fact
498.759,500.35,this might be the world's most
500.36,504.35,convenient refill station for your
504.36,506.629,washer fluid and by the way I was trying
506.639,508.99,to pop it open when the car was locked
509.0,510.869,and it wasn't allowing me to do so so
510.879,513.79,nobody can mess with your washer fluid
513.8,515.509,pour something else in there I mean I
515.519,516.949,didn't even think about that until I
516.959,518.63,just tried to open it while the car was
518.64,520.31,locked now one of the reasons for that
520.32,522.19,is because underneath This Hood there is
522.2,524.59,no frunk this is a frontless EV and you
524.6,526.509,might be like wait a sec there should be
526.519,528.79,plenty of room under there according to
528.8,530.75,Mercedes there's all kinds of important
530.76,532.31,components that are housed under there
532.32,534.23,and therefore you get no frunk and
534.24,537.19,you'll be refilling your washer fluid on
537.2,539.43,the side of the vehicle over here these
539.44,542.15,doors are motorized self-closing when
542.16,543.75,you get into the driver's seat if you
543.76,545.67,put your foot on the brake pedal the
545.68,547.63,door will close on its own you can also
547.64,549.63,program the unlock button if you press
549.64,552.79,and hold you can have it open in this
552.8,555.15,case the passenger door like magic look
555.16,558.509,at this go ahead step right up no
558.519,561.31,problem and to close the door a little
561.32,564.71,touch on the outside and more magic
564.72,566.829,another mybok logo down here I think
566.839,569.069,this is kind of funny this little step
569.079,570.87,because the car is not that high to
570.88,572.829,begin with another Maybach emblem here
572.839,574.55,this is maybe my favorite one of the
574.56,576.59,bunch I don't know why that is I just
576.6,578.03,feel like that is the perfect spot for
578.04,580.23,an emblem I just like this emblem also
580.24,582.91,on this side we have our charge port and
582.92,584.75,it's underneath this cap here this looks
584.76,586.87,pretty simple of course we have our flip
586.88,589.31,down for faster charging I can notice
589.32,591.509,some gaskets there as well to keep water
591.519,594.31,from getting in around back I mean it's
594.32,597.23,simple looking kind of from every angle
597.24,599.91,but what they've added is detail one of
599.92,601.389,those things is the way that you open
601.399,604.03,the trunk so a lot of SUVs you have some
604.04,605.55,sort of button down at the bottom where
605.56,607.269,it lifts up and you kind of search for
607.279,609.069,it and it gets dirty down there this one
609.079,610.43,you're not going to miss because it's
610.44,613.269,this giant Mercedes emblem in the center
613.279,615.67,and it does dual function because it
615.68,618.55,also flips up for your rear-facing
618.56,621.55,camera parking camera just push like
621.56,623.949,that and it opens up the trunk and of
623.959,625.43,course the whole time you're getting
625.44,628.79,that nice little Ambience of the tail
628.8,631.47,light there buzzing back and forth as
631.48,633.63,you do these activities the other thing
633.64,635.15,you notice when you open this up is this
635.16,637.75,detail here you have really what is an
637.76,641.43,upside down mybach emblem but then it's
641.44,644.59,right side up when you open up the trunk
644.6,647.87,this is all leather wrapped leather
647.88,651.509,stitched sections pretty much everywhere
651.519,653.269,we have a charge cable in the back it's
653.279,655.71,tethered so it doesn't jump around too
655.72,658.11,much and we've also got a little
658.12,659.509,compartment I didn't even open this up
659.519,661.19,yet but a little compartment for some
661.2,662.99,extras looks like an air compressor for
663.0,664.91,the Tire in there and one thing I do
664.92,667.31,like as well you have these metal
667.32,669.91,protectors for bigger pieces of luggage
669.92,672.15,and things this is the first for me I
672.16,674.79,haven't seen the luggage cover with
674.8,677.03,built-in speakers before so they figured
677.04,678.91,out a way to just give it a little added
678.92,681.829,depth burm if you haven't had exposure
681.839,685.11,it's sort of that topend as far as car
685.12,688.15,audio like from the factory this is
688.16,690.43,typically an upgrade from other brands
690.44,695.35,oh also this unit can be configured with
695.36,698.03,the refrigerator for some reason this
698.04,699.99,particular model that we're looking at
700.0,702.47,doesn't have that option but if you did
702.48,704.43,have the option for the fridge it would
704.44,706.59,be sitting sort of right here it is nice
706.6,708.71,to know that it is removable like so you
708.72,710.55,can take the fridge in and out if you
710.56,712.43,need more cargo but that's where it
712.44,714.79,would go if you don't have the fridge
714.8,716.949,configured this acts as a pass through
716.959,718.91,for longer items I put a few hockey
718.92,721.91,sticks through
721.92,724.629,there closed oh I should also mention
724.639,726.75,while we're on the outside you have a
726.76,729.87,big panoramic glass this does open and
729.88,731.99,it looks like you've also got a spot for
732.0,734.99,a roof rack Mercedes let's let's do a
735.0,738.189,project off-road mybach another burm
738.199,741.31,Master speaker here and one up top here
741.32,743.389,they're they are all over the place the
743.399,746.31,sound system and the sound experience I
746.32,748.509,had my 4-year-old daughter in here and
748.519,750.269,that was her number one favorite feature
750.279,751.47,I said before I said you're not going to
751.48,753.99,ride in this car anymore Mercedes is
754.0,756.67,taking this car back but I do want to
756.68,757.99,know what your favorite thing about it
758.0,760.389,was and she said listening to the trolls
760.399,763.11,soundtrack anyway over here is where
763.12,764.99,you're going to control and configure
765.0,767.629,your comfort for your seat here you have
767.639,770.03,seat heating you have seat cooling as
770.04,771.829,far as seat configuration goes my
771.839,774.389,favorite section is here this little
774.399,777.55,button on the top controls seat depth
777.56,779.99,this is this is my thigh okay it's kind
780.0,783.189,of a longer it's a longer thigh so a lot
783.199,786.269,of seats end up feeling kind of short
786.279,788.75,and I'll sit in it this is with it in
788.76,791.31,its default position you can see there's
791.32,794.069,a gap from the end of the seat to where
794.079,796.15,my leg actually ends so if I have this
796.16,799.069,up here that's half a thigh half half an
799.079,802.069,unsupported thigh so if I grab this guy
802.079,803.79,and move this out check out what happens
803.8,806.71,the seat depth and it's from the back so
806.72,809.11,my butt is actually see I can it's a
809.12,811.99,it's extending here see the seat pan is
812.0,814.629,moving out further so my butt can sink
814.639,816.23,back further even though this section
816.24,818.03,stays roughly the same length and then
818.04,820.03,look what happens I get this nice
820.04,822.79,support the whole way that's my favorite
822.8,826.43,car seat feature that I've uh
826.44,829.829,experienced the key with this vehicle is
829.839,833.389,just how quiet and peaceful it is the
833.399,838.069,world melts away your stress melts away
838.079,840.31,it truly has an effect on you when you
840.32,842.069,think about these refinements and you
842.079,844.15,think why would you go through this
844.16,848.55,painstaking process of trying to cut the
848.56,851.55,sound of the road or external sound so
851.56,854.23,much well obviously because you want to
854.24,856.629,charge people for it eventually but also
856.639,859.67,because you are trying to deliver the
859.68,862.23,most refined Driving Experience and I
862.24,863.749,think they may have done it in this
887.0,888.389,okay so we're inside now that's what
888.399,890.11,it's all about with the mybach the
890.12,893.629,inside bringing the mybok portion to the
893.639,896.71,eqs means that you're getting the most
896.72,899.629,updated and highest Tech interior
899.639,901.15,that Mercedes is really offering you're
901.16,903.79,getting this massive display across the
903.8,905.829,front well it's actually three different
905.839,909.269,displays but they make it seam like one
909.279,911.389,through this seamless piece of glass
911.399,913.31,that just carries across the whole thing
913.32,916.11,it's it's a really refined approach
916.12,918.03,compared to other Interiors where you
918.04,921.629,have oh Mercedes heard me say mer cancel
921.639,923.55,thanks likewise the other thing you're
923.56,925.55,going to notice is the ambient lighting
925.56,928.03,but essentially you've got this light
928.04,929.87,strip it goes all the way around the
929.88,933.269,vehicle and it's capable of responding
933.279,934.71,to situations so like if you're going to
934.72,936.91,exit your lane or something it goes red
936.92,939.03,so if we hit the ambient light button
939.04,941.35,yes it can do monochrome really any
941.36,943.67,color as you can see it carries to the
943.68,945.91,dash as well so that's all right you can
945.92,947.71,do monochrome obviously have brightness
947.72,949.11,settings you can do different zones you
949.12,951.03,can link the zones but multicolor is the
951.04,953.389,coolest some other cool options are
953.399,955.749,gradients that move between different
955.759,958.47,colors from Blue to teal or from purple
959.519,963.11,yellow cyan to magenta the fact that it
963.12,965.87,also moves through other Dash elements
965.88,968.949,and displays creates some amazing
968.959,971.23,Ambience at night I don't think any
971.24,975.47,other company competes in that space as
975.48,977.949,far as customizable Ambience because
977.959,981.23,there's so many different minor lighting
981.24,983.87,elements and Screen elements that are
983.88,986.43,all contributing to that Ambience like
986.44,989.47,down in the footwell or around
989.48,994.829,the vents which by the way are really
994.839,996.67,satisfying they kind of look like
996.68,1000.509,something out of a retro fighter plane
1000.519,1003.189,but they're manual they're not inside of
1003.199,1005.749,a screen they're quick to adjust and
1005.759,1009.389,they're smooth and this tiny little RGB
1009.399,1013.23,ring lights up the pattern and just
1013.24,1015.509,contributes to that ambient so there is
1015.519,1017.389,another way to control the doors which
1017.399,1019.829,is via this display show you which doors
1019.839,1022.509,are open or closed and it'll let you
1022.519,1025.309,open or close any of the four doors from
1025.319,1028.189,this location you can see my door opens
1028.199,1030.35,up and I can exit now obviously you've
1030.36,1032.669,also got Wireless Android auto Apple
1032.679,1034.63,carplay options that are in here now
1034.64,1035.949,we're going to talk a little bit more
1035.959,1037.75,about this variety of features when
1037.76,1039.59,we're actually driving before we get out
1039.6,1040.829,on the road I just want to finish up
1040.839,1042.11,talking about the interior and most
1042.12,1044.27,importantly the back seat so this center
1044.28,1046.309,console here we get more of this kind of
1046.319,1048.39,open pour wood you can see the way it's
1048.4,1051.35,laid in there and just this really nice
1051.36,1054.51,texture to it this portion slides open
1054.52,1056.23,and you have a wireless charger up front
1056.24,1058.549,which you can see is lit and it has a
1058.559,1061.31,nonslip pad in there you also have two
1061.32,1063.63,USBC ports and they do Quick Charge
1063.64,1065.07,we've got another set of controls here
1065.08,1068.07,we can control our Drive modes and it's
1068.08,1070.909,currently in the mybox setting which
1070.919,1073.71,they suggest is to do mostly with your
1073.72,1075.19,suspension you're having mybox
1075.2,1077.029,suspension which is just like a way to
1077.039,1079.31,think about that is just the smoothest
1079.32,1081.99,ride you've ever experienced my bock is
1082.0,1083.99,the default is what I've been in almost
1084.0,1086.27,the entire time however there is a sport
1086.28,1088.909,mode and it will get more responsive
1088.919,1091.43,this thing is about 0 to 60 in 4.4
1091.44,1093.99,seconds I believe which is impressive
1094.0,1097.99,for a vehicle of this scale and weight
1098.0,1102.669,so extremely useful camera system for
1102.679,1105.35,parking assistance I can look at every
1105.36,1108.149,angle around the car rendered inside the
1108.159,1110.39,studio the other thing we have here is
1110.4,1113.27,some storage and actually what's inside
1113.28,1116.789,the storage right now is number 12 mood
1116.799,1121.47,interior perfume this car has a scent
1121.48,1123.43,aspect to it when it's setting the mood
1123.44,1125.95,with the ambient and the variety of
1125.96,1128.27,different sound profiles you can set up
1128.28,1129.87,but you can have a scent to go along
1129.88,1132.27,with it this installs in the glove box
1132.28,1134.029,we've also got headphones wireless
1134.039,1136.909,headphones you can see we have a nice
1136.919,1140.149,bag to hold it in look at these look at
1140.159,1142.149,those units right there I mean those are
1142.159,1143.789,cool enough on their own Mercedes
1143.799,1146.95,branded noise cancelling headphones two
1146.96,1148.99,pairs now this steering wheel is like
1149.0,1152.31,this glossy finish with leather wrap on
1152.32,1155.909,the inside a very luxurious feel uh if
1155.919,1157.51,you're familiar with Mercedes like this
1157.52,1160.669,is a thing s-classes it just you know
1160.679,1162.11,you're driving something different when
1162.12,1163.71,you have this dual setup on the wheel
1163.72,1165.27,with the gloss and the leather on the
1165.28,1167.27,inside of course you've got plenty of
1167.28,1169.31,adjustment for the wheel as well as far
1169.32,1170.47,as the seats are concerned like I mean
1170.48,1172.669,you got this beautiful quilted finish to
1172.679,1175.95,it all very high quality very adjustable
1175.96,1178.07,and then obviously a variety of
1178.08,1180.59,different massage settings as well which
1180.6,1181.83,maybe I'll turn those on when we
1181.84,1183.15,actually get out and get
1196.159,1199.31,driving now nighttime
1199.32,1201.39,is when you want to be in this car it is
1201.4,1204.83,like cyberpunk it is like futuristic it
1204.84,1207.789,is unexpected my initial eqs video This
1207.799,1210.149,is the part that blew me away the most
1210.159,1212.71,and it gets a reaction every single time
1212.72,1214.39,the ambient Lighting in here is so
1214.4,1217.83,considerate all this variety of bright
1218.84,1222.99,linear and diffusion like subtle
1223.0,1227.27,diffusion you hear that gentle
1227.28,1230.95,hum that peaceful sound that
1230.96,1234.789,Ambience this diffused sound just kind
1234.799,1239.07,of there and this gradient that flows
1239.08,1242.51,through your dash see if I change the
1242.52,1246.87,mood it will affect the displays and the
1246.88,1251.63,ambience Miami Rose burning Blue Malibu
1251.64,1255.909,sunset Ocean Blue jungle Green Garnet
1255.919,1260.71,glow rose gold white amethyst
1265.32,1269.27,glow all right so the back seat of the
1269.28,1271.71,mybach is where you want to be if you
1271.72,1275.83,can because this is the most comfortable
1275.84,1278.269,spot I mean it's better than a limo like
1278.279,1279.909,it's you have access to all your
1279.919,1281.789,entertainment you have the ability to
1281.799,1283.75,recline you've got this pillow where
1283.76,1286.39,your head is then you have these
1286.4,1290.23,optional lumbar pillows with mybach
1290.24,1292.269,branding on them I've actually got it
1292.279,1293.549,out right now cuz it lets me get a
1293.559,1296.31,little bit further back I am exactly 6
1296.32,1299.75,ft tall and I can get my feet up on this
1299.76,1302.269,foot rest like check out this
1302.279,1305.11,positioning here comes the foot rest as
1305.12,1307.269,well to support the bottom part of my
1307.279,1310.669,legs and this has a pillow on it also
1310.679,1312.909,and that just takes the weight off of my
1312.919,1315.47,heels over there so if I push my feet to
1315.48,1317.87,the side I can be comfortable no problem
1317.88,1321.07,it also will move the front seat forward
1321.08,1324.07,and then put the screen into the right
1324.08,1326.35,orientation for me to see it like at the
1326.36,1329.19,right angle now you might be saying how
1329.2,1330.87,are you going to reach that screen to
1330.88,1333.23,interact with it though well you don't
1333.24,1334.99,have to because you have this tablet
1335.0,1336.669,right here and I can either use the
1336.679,1339.47,tablet in that location or I can use
1339.48,1342.59,this little extraction motor to lift it
1342.6,1345.83,up and then use it like this and so from
1345.84,1348.149,here I can control all types of aspects
1348.159,1350.269,of the car there's a few different ways
1350.279,1352.19,you can interface as far as the media is
1352.2,1354.549,concerned you have Bluetooth online
1354.559,1358.909,music USB media files and two HDMI ports
1358.919,1361.35,so you just open this up like
1361.36,1363.59,this and this is actually pretty cool
1363.6,1365.07,because you also get this wireless
1365.08,1368.149,charger with an anti-slip mat tons of
1368.159,1370.95,USB ports fast charge capable there's
1370.96,1372.31,four of them here and they're
1372.32,1375.43,illuminated with blue LEDs you also have
1375.44,1378.19,a DC if you need a little bit more power
1378.2,1381.35,and and then these are mini hdmis so
1381.36,1382.75,that's important to note you would need
1382.76,1384.789,an adapter listen it's something you're
1384.799,1387.23,going to get once and then you'll be
1387.24,1388.909,done with it you'll just have a nice
1388.919,1390.63,little adapter in there for whichever
1390.64,1392.71,device you want to connect you could
1392.72,1394.71,even get crazy and try to run like a
1394.72,1396.63,game console with an external battery
1396.64,1400.11,and an HDMI and play some PlayStation on
1400.12,1401.789,this display if you want to now that's
1401.799,1403.19,not the only compartment when you're
1403.2,1405.11,back here by the way that's just one of
1405.12,1407.549,two this is a motorized compartment tons
1407.559,1410.75,of that open port wood in this location
1410.76,1413.83,we click this button and this motor goes
1413.84,1416.95,into action opening this section here we
1416.96,1420.43,have two cup holders hot and cold you
1420.44,1422.669,have room for a smaller bottle and then
1422.679,1424.95,a larger one and you can feel it start
1424.96,1427.149,to get cold right away if I click it
1427.159,1429.029,again I move into hot mode and what I
1429.039,1431.35,love here is it's so obvious which mode
1431.36,1433.549,you're in pillows for the lumbar which I
1433.559,1437.029,have down there pillows for your head
1437.039,1438.71,another funny thing about these seats
1438.72,1441.63,they do have isofix under here it's kind
1441.64,1443.23,of just a funny thought of like a kid
1443.24,1446.39,being in this rear seat being chauffered
1446.4,1448.47,around a lot of glass which makes it
1448.48,1450.99,feel more open and large and then you'll
1451.0,1453.51,probably also see the RGB continues all
1453.52,1456.07,through here and it just creates like so
1456.08,1458.669,many different diffused lighting zones
1458.679,1460.149,another thing you'll notice here
1460.159,1463.23,illuminated seat belt buckle a simple
1463.24,1465.31,little thing at night you're looking for
1465.32,1467.23,this well now you're not really looking
1467.24,1469.029,Oh My My Little pillow
1469.039,1471.909,came loose there's the cooling ooh
1471.919,1474.75,lovely very like powerful cooling by the
1474.76,1478.149,way like my butt is cold immediately
1478.159,1480.269,just getting getting work done you know
1480.279,1482.87,reading my docu reading magazines if I
1482.88,1484.35,had a car like this I'd just be back
1484.36,1486.35,here reading magazines National
1486.36,1488.35,Geographic Mo doesn't even know what a
1488.36,1490.389,magazine is the back is better than the
1490.399,1492.07,front I mean this is this is wild back
1492.08,1495.19,here this is so comfy it's a mybok like
1495.2,1508.99,yeah of course that's what you paid for
1509.0,1511.07,I had a cousin once that visited when I
1511.08,1513.669,was in high school from
1515.2,1518.71,and his favorite thing like if he didn't
1518.72,1519.83,understand something we were talking
1519.84,1522.35,about sure what
1522.36,1524.549,is oh just told me to put my hands on
1524.559,1526.63,the wheel right there I was looking away
1526.64,1528.75,too much I thought but look at can I say
1528.76,1531.669,I mean this is about Comfort it's about
1531.679,1533.83,relaxation it's about
1533.84,1537.23,refinement it's as if you
1537.24,1540.19,gave somebody a mission a team you gave
1540.2,1541.669,them a mission you
1541.679,1547.35,said make the most comfortable
1547.36,1549.389,sophisticated person
1551.279,1555.63,vehicle that you possibly can and they
1555.64,1557.31,thought of everything they thought of
1557.32,1558.909,everything you might
1558.919,1562.43,might want to have in something like
1562.44,1564.51,that certainly when you step into this
1564.52,1566.35,when you drive
1566.36,1569.23,it you get a sense for that level of
1569.24,1571.11,refinement and the amount of work that
1571.12,1572.83,would would have gone
1572.84,1577.549,into executing that the idea seems
1577.559,1580.07,simple maybe outside of the
1580.08,1582.87,electrification the idea what do you
1582.88,1587.029,have to have tighter gaps and thicker
1587.039,1590.23,glass and and more comfortable seats
1590.24,1593.789,with more adjustments and reclines and
1593.799,1596.35,the but it's the execution that's
1596.36,1599.11,really where the rubber meets the
1599.12,1601.83,road for a vehicle like that's really
1601.84,1604.269,what matters is the execution you got to
1604.279,1608.149,go in there with a fine tooth comb and a
1608.159,1610.789,bunch of people got to check on that
1610.799,1614.19,manufacturing process and there's so
1614.2,1615.95,many different people involved in the
1615.96,1619.19,production of a car like this to ensure
1619.2,1620.99,that it meets that quality standard and
1621.0,1624.11,that's really what sets these Ultra
1624.12,1626.31,Luxury Vehicles apart it's what sets
1626.32,1631.47,that mybach branding apart from the
1631.48,1634.43,standard Mercedes brand which is already
1634.44,1636.87,obviously luxurious but will has the
1636.88,1639.149,best seat the guy who matters most is in
1639.159,1641.51,your seat will like if you're in
1641.52,1643.51,Germany right and you're on your way to
1643.52,1646.23,an important meeting this car picks you
1646.24,1648.23,up and you sit there you're wearing a
1648.24,1653.63,suit you are are stressed that's it just
1653.64,1657.99,a 10minute Serene Breeze
1658.0,1660.63,reprieve this suspension is
1660.64,1663.23,ridiculous it's a hovercraft here's like
1663.24,1664.669,I'm going to venture off the road a
1664.679,1666.389,little bit you didn't feel it that was
1666.399,1669.35,dirt that's a dirt you didn't feel it
1669.36,1671.99,guy behind me thinks I'm nuts he thinks
1672.0,1675.389,the guy in the uh mybach has lost it he
1675.399,1678.83,he might not be wrong he might not be
1678.84,1681.31,wrong or maybe I gained it maybe I
1681.32,1682.56,didn't lose it maybe I gained
1702.6,1706.38,it cheese
1708.76,1712.509,only time can provide yeah like a place
1712.519,1716.43,like this yeah without the time it's not
1716.44,1719.59,what it is it needs the time you what I
